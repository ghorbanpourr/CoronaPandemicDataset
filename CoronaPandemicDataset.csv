1,at first you might think it's a cold and it could be but covid 19 could escalate here's what you need to know according to the World Health Organization China joint mission on covid 19 as of February 20th 80 % of laboratory confirmed cases were mild to moderate 14% were severe and 6% were critical just to be clear a mild case of CO fit 19 is not like a mild cold the symptoms will still be pretty severe anything less than needing oxygen puts you in this category severe cases do need supplemental oxygen and critical ones are defined by respiratory or multi organ failure the symptoms treatments and timelines of having the disease vary depending on which category patients fall into so let's break down what having covid 19 looks like day to day for each level of severity it can take as few as 2 or as many as 14 days after being exposed to the novel coronavirus for the first symptom to develop this is when it might feel like a cold or the common flu many patients develop fevers early on the World Health Organization China joint mission saw that about 88 percent of people who had covid 19 had a fever another study out of China showed that while only 44 percent of patients had a fever on admission to a hospital 89 percent eventually developed one but there have been some cases that led with gastrointestinal symptoms diarrhea nausea vomiting and/or abdominal discomfort may appear a couple of days before respiratory symptoms this isn't the norm though because covid 19 is a respiratory disease that means for most patients the virus will start and end with the lungs in the early days of infection the virus invades lung cells specifically this can damage the cilia the hairlike projections that move around to keep Airways clear of mucous and debris when cells get infected they die and shed off adding to the debris and hindering your body's ability to keep stuff out of the lungs and trachea the inflammation causes damage and damage causes more inflammation and this cycle could continue until there's no healthy tissue left and inflammation might explain why a dry cough is one of the most common symptoms same goes for shortness of breath and phlegm production other symptoms that can appear around this time are fatigue sore throat headache joint or muscle pain chills and a runny nose by day five patients with pre-existing conditions might find that they have trouble breathing and it usually takes about seven days for a person to go to a hospital mild cases though usually clear up by this time but those with moderate to critical cases will have developed pneumonia which can range from non-life threatening to severe recovery time for these patients could be anywhere from a few days to weeks for some severe and critical cases though symptoms can escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome a RDS is an illness that happens when fluid builds up in the lungs inflammation triggers a flood of immune cells that are meant to target the infection they're usually isolated to infected areas but sometimes the body goes overboard which is when the immune cells start killing anything in their path including healthy cells a RDS is often fatal in critical cases it can lead to respiratory failure requiring advanced life support and this is most likely when patients head to the ICU a RDS treatment includes supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation the goal is to get more oxygen into the bloodstream since the lungs can't when this treatment doesn't work the lungs are basically too flooded to get any oxygen into your bloodstream that's the cause of most covid 19 deaths and even when a patient survives this phase they could be left with permanent lung damage SARS punched holes and some infected people's lungs giving them a honeycomb effect and these lesions have been seen in people affected by the novel coronavirus too early studies found that most people who die of the disease will do so within 14 to 19 days and on average people who recover are released from the hospital after two and a half weeks but with the most critical cases recovery could take months once a patient is in the recovery period it's possible that they could still be contagious these people should work with their doctors and public health officials to determine when they're no longer a risk as of now there is no vaccine for the virus so the best way to avoid getting sick is to avoid being exposed covid 19 spreads easily from person to person through coughing and sneezing so wash your hands often and avoid close contact with people who are sick and clean and disinfect surfaces that you use daily ghovat 19 should be taken seriously but most cases are survivable so stay home stay clean and don't panic,What_Coronavirus_Symptoms_Look_Like_Day_By_Day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA,4725,general
2,"This novel coronavirus pandemic has truly affected all of us across the globe, but one of the hardest hit communities has been healthcare frontline workers. This means doctors, nurses, CMAs, respiratory therapists, technicians, custodial staff, and so many more. Today I'd like to take a focus and celebrate doctors, in memory of those who've laid down their lives in the battle against COVID-19. I sat down, and I interviewed over 100 physicians to get their take, their experiences, and learn their perspectives about the coronavirus. Know that all the revenue generated from this video, AdSense, donations, and even merch sales, link down below, are all going to the CDC Foundation to help continue this battle against COVID-19. The first question I asked these doctors, what do you think is not getting enough attention? - I wish there was more credit and awareness being given to other members of the healthcare teams, aside from just the doctors and the nurses. - Techs, transporters, housekeeping, kitchen staff, valets, operators. - X-ray, laboratory, radiology techs, EMT, janitorial staff. - Cafeteria workers, the respiratory therapists, the nurses, and everyone else here on the frontline is towards our abilities to do our jobs. - The number of doctors and healthcare professionals out there who have gotten seriously ill, even lost their lives fighting this disease. - Some healthcare workers have been disciplined for speaking up about the lack of personal protective equipment. - Testing is an area we need a huge amount of focus on and attention on in the UK. - We need antibody tests. We need to know who has immunity. - In many communities, the small number of cases being reported is simply a reflection of lack of testing. - How coronavirus is and will affect certain communities, our homeless community, our community of people with special needs. - The domestic abuse and domestic violence that is happening during a pandemic with victims being in the same home as perpetrators for longer periods of time in this quarantine. - We've limited and cut the number of visits a woman can have before she delivers. - Visitors, family, really no one is allowed to be at the bedside when you're infected with COVID. - If you look closely, you will see that there are young people, who are otherwise well, who can get seriously ill. - We can't really see the emotional toll that the outbreak has on us. - The effect that this is all having on our mental health and well-being. - Mental health problems don't stop just because we are having an infectious-disease pandemic. - I've had patients who haven't been able to get cancer surgery, who've had significant heart problems and not been able to get them worked up. - If people who now feel sick from cancer are now discouraged from going to hospitals because all the attention now is on COVID-19, then we're gonna miss some of those patients. - Right now we're postponing all the non-urgent cases, and when things are lifted, we're gonna see everyone come back all at once. - How is one supposed to date in this point in time? Are we just supposed to get to know people by Zoom and FaceTime? - Yeah, virtual dating is a thing now. For my next question, I asked, what does it mean for you to be a doctor now? - It means a 30-minute decontamination routine before I get to hug my kids every time I come home from the hospital. - Practicing medicine during this pandemic means what it always means, protecting the vulnerable. - This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to boldly fulfill my oath and desire to save lives. - The COVID-19 pandemic has me in a place where I have never felt more connected to my profession. - I have an opportunity to step up and really honor my oath. - I really feel like it's a privilege for me to be able to practice medicine during the pandemic. It allows me to serve my community when my community needs me most. - I'm old enough to have lived through the early years of the AIDS epidemic, and it had a similar feeling. You knew you were in the middle of something incredibly important. - My mother gave me a magnet a long time ago that said, ""Not all heroes wear capes. ""Some of them wear stethoscopes."" - I'm not running away from it. I'm running toward it. - We're ready, we signed up for this, we took an oath. - It's a privilege to be a part of the solution. - It's an honor to care for patients and their families and to help navigate them through these very challenging times. - Medicine is a calling and a vocation. I've never viewed it as a job. - This isn't a job. This is a calling. - I couldn't agree more. Next I asked, how have you been personally affected by the coronavirus? - When we put a breathing tube in for a patient, which we have to do for almost every surgery, we're really exposed to everything that's in that patient's mouth or throat or airway. It's like looking down the barrel of a gun. - I'll be moving out of our house soon and into some place that's closer to the hospital and where I won't risk infecting my own family. - Should I move out, should I isolate within the home? - I haven't seen my mom or my dad or any family members in the last few weeks. - I have some sick family members. I don't know when I'll see them next. - I wasn't able to kiss my wife on our anniversary this year because of coronavirus. - My beautiful wife and I are about to bring new life into this world, and with that comes fear, worry, and anxiety. - Both of my daughters work with me here at the Cleveland clinic. I'm worried for the family, but we're gonna do this. - My entire family lives and practices a self-care survival simile, and when I read in the news that 2,027 physicians, as of yesterday, have contracted the virus and many have died from it, it gave me chills. - I recently got sick with a lot of the features of COVID-19. Without testing, I've got no way of knowing if I had it for sure. I don't know if I'll be infected again. I don't know if I'm going to infect my patients. - I did get corona. I was actually sick for two weeks, had pneumonia, and it was probably the worst health experience that I have ever been through. - I developed a fever and a lot of the COVID symptoms. When I ended up in the emergency room, all I could think about was when I recover, will this make me immune so I can get back out there? - For the first time ever, lately, I've been having the sense of uneasiness as I drive into work. - I've personally seen a lot of death that I don't know if residency could ever prepare you for. - Because our pain clinics closed down last week, and before I'll be transitioning to telemedicine soon, there's still a gap where I will be unemployed as a pain management fellow, and that leaves me financially unstable. - So I'm still paying rent, overhead, staff, supplies, all of the above with basically no income. - I'm a physician on O'ahu, and it's challenging caring for my neighbor island patients on Maui and the Big island. - Hydroxychloroquine has been getting a lot of press during this pandemic, and the availability of this medication has been a big concern for myself and for my patients. - I've been forced to delay important heartbeat and heart rhythm procedures for several of my patients. - I lost childcare, so my toddler keeps barging into all of my appointments, and that's probably a HIPAA violation. - Hey, I can relate. Bear walks into some of my patient visits too. Next I asked, how can we help from home? - Believe it or not, not everyone is taking social distancing seriously. - The virus doesn't spread on its own. People spread the virus, so you are on the frontline in this pandemic. - Even small indulgences, like going to a park around other people, can have huge consequences that you don't even feel in the moment. - Treat every outside contact as something potentially infected, no matter how healthy or safe someone or something looks. - This thing does not care what you look like, how much money you have, or how wealthy you are, so you have to stay home. - No cheating. I know it gets really boring at home sometimes, and all you want to do is just be with your friend just for a minute, but please, for our sake, stay home. - Stay home. That's how you fight the virus. - Get comfortable, and stay there. Netflix and chill. YouTube and thrill. - Please, please, please stay home. Help us help you. - Help me help you. - Stay hydrated, get some sleep, eat healthy, don't smoke, and please do some exercise while you're at home. - Here's my prescription for you. Stay home. - We are not stuck at home. We are safe at home. - Safe at home, not stuck at home. And please treat everyone with kindness. - Everyone knows someone who is putting their life at risk by working during these difficult times. Just send them a thank you. - Continue sending positive vibes and continue reaching out to those who are in their support system. We need their help. - And just be kind to each other. Everyone's having a hard time. - Physical distancing is crucial, but it should not cause social isolation. - Call or FaceTime your friends, your family, your significant others. - The virus mainly infects through mucus membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth, so even if we wear gloves and we wear masks, if we touch our face, we can still get infected. - Washing your hands, and no I'm not just talking like oh, wash, wash, wash, and you're done. I'm talking a full 20 seconds. - Wash your hands. - Wash your hands multiple times throughout the day. - Really diligent hand washing. - Wash your hands. - And as I say to my five year old, don't pick your nose. - Be wary of the browsers and the pickers at the grocery store. You know I'm talking about, those people that are picking up avocados and putting them right back. - By being very careful of your internet hygiene because spreading false information can be deadly. - Everyone has a role to play in making sure that we spread correct information. - Stop spreading misinformation on social media. I think this is very important. - Just following credible media outlets. Don't give in to the hysteria. - The top thing on my mind, is remembering to stay flexible and lean into uncertainty. - Have those difficult end-of-life discussions. You will feel at peace knowing your loved one's wishes, whether the time comes tomorrow or a decade from now. - Ask neighbors to put up a red piece of paper in their window if they need assistance immediately. A yellow piece means I need help, but not urgently. And green means things are okay. - And please know that when the scientists are saying these things, we're not saying them because we're out to get you. We're saying them because we care about you. - That's right. We're on team you. All right, my final question, what gives you hope? - It gives me goosebumps when I think about what you see around you. - The doctors, nurses, social workers, respiratory therapists, environmental services. - Each and every one of us is doing what we can. - It's the fact that I have a great ICU team. I have the best ICU nurses in the world. - The unity, the compassion, and empathy. - Humanity exists, and we're all in this together. - I live in New York City, and every night at 7:00, the entire city breaks out in cheer and applause for all the healthcare workers. (crowd cheering and applauding) - I'm hearing from families who are having more family meals, more family meetings, they're playing board games, they're communicating, they're talking. - People are coming together, and they are helping out their neighbors. - Letters like this in my mailbox from my neighbor, spreading love across this country. - Every patient that I called, the first thing they asked is how was I doing. - The outpouring of love and support from communities all around the world, showing their support for healthcare workers, like me, on the frontline. - All of our frontline workers, in hundreds of roles, inside the hospital and outside of it, working their tails off every single day. - My trainees all stepping up to volunteer to help in the ICU. - Healthcare professionals everywhere are stepping up instead of backing down. - The emergency department staff, now more than ever. - We've put aside all turf wars and inter-departmental bickering. - The fact that the world has set aside its differences to work on novel treatments, vaccines, and drugs for this virus. - The people donating and making supplies. - Like when we see businesses that stop their work and start producing equipment for healthcare providers. - Even famous fashion designers, like Chanel and Christian Siriano are making masks and gowns. - The numbers are getting better. Prevention does work. - Seeing people on their balconies applauding those on the frontline gives me hope. And seeing science working, creating vaccines, creating treatments is what gives me hope. - I'm fighting for the hope that one day, very soon, we overcome this, that we get back to normal life and don't take the small things for granted again.",Doctors Tell You The TRUTH About Battling Coronavirus.txt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhHfjsOl8Tc,6442,
3,"As the pandemic continues - variants have become the latest concern with notable examples detected in South Africa, Brazil and the UK. But variants are complicated. Each one is made up of a collection of mutations, all of which have the potential to change the SARS-CoV-2 virus in unexpected ways. So what do scientists mean when they talk about variants and what might this mean for the future of the pandemic? Viruses multiply by copying their genomes over and over. But like an old photocopier, these copies aren’t always perfect. Each of these imperfect copies is a variant. Normally the imperfections or mutations don’t change how the virus behaves and they can often make it less successful than the original strain. But very rarely mutations can change the virus in some important ways. It could become more infectious, or more able to avoid the immune system. The more a virus is allowed to replicate unchecked, the more chance it has to accumulate these rare beneficial mutations. That can occur when viruses are allowed to spread quickly through a population, or if they encounter a host that’s less able to fight them, such as people with compromised immune systems from medical treatment or those who are HIV+. If a particular set of mutations makes a variant more successful, it might become more prominent than others and that’s when it gets noticed. Epidemiologists may even decide to label it a ‘variant of concern’, like the examples identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK. For months, scientists have been striving to work out what’s changed in these variants, and what those changes mean. Because a variant spreading doesn’t necessarily mean that it has an advantageous mutation. For example a small number of people could, by chance, move a variant from one region to another, like tourists travelling back from popular vacation spots. This could cause that variant to start spreading in a new location even though there may be no significant change to the biology of the virus. This is called the Founder Effect. Understanding why a variant has emerged requires a combination of studies. Epidemiology can help detect and trace new variants and flag new or worrying patterns of infection. Meanwhile lab studies can start to pinpoint how the mutations are changing the properties of the virus. And studies like these are starting to identify mutations that have given the virus an upper hand. Some variants are faster spreading, and there are hints that certain mutations could start to weaken or even evade natural and vaccine derived immunity. For example, the D614G mutation, known to virologists as Doug, spread widely in the early days of the pandemic and can be seen in almost all variants. It affects the spike protein that coronavirus particles use to penetrate cells. A mutation in the genome changes one amino acid for another, and makes the new variant more infectious than the original virus. N501Y also known as Nelly, is another spike protein mutation which appears to be associated with increased transmissibility. This mutation has been detected in the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 strains - all variants of concern. The worry of so-called ‘immune escape’ has also been hinted at with another spike protein mutation, E484K or Eek. Eek has been spotted in B.1.351 and P.1, the variants detected in South Africa and Brazil. Lab studies in early in 2021 showed that the variant could evade some virus-blocking antibodies, while trials in South Africa suggested that the variant reduced the efficacy of several vaccines. Despite these worries, the coronavirus is actually mutating very slowly compared to something like influenza and it seems like the vaccines developed so far will remain at least partly effective. But scientists are still taking the threat posed by variants seriously. And there are several things that can be done to help tackle it. Firstly, to do anything researchers need data - it’s very important to monitor and trace the emergence of variants and that isn’t always simple to do. Organisations like the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium, or COG-UK, have stepped up their efforts to combine fast sequencing with efficient data sharing. COG-UK has already sequenced over 400,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Next, researchers need to look forward to how these mutated viruses could affect global vaccination efforts. Existing vaccines can be redesigned and combinations of vaccines are also being tested but it could be difficult to perform reliable clinical trials amid the ongoing vaccination programmes. Right now though, work needs to continue at a national level. Public health policies such as track and trace, social distancing and vaccine roll-outs are powerful tools to interrupt transmission and keep tabs on new variants. After all, every time the virus is prevented from spreading, it's also prevented from mutating, nipping new variants in the bud before they even have a chance to develop.

4,how does this coronavirus SARS coronavirus to kill people? this virus we know is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets and through contact and it gets into our mucosa of our mouth our nose and our eyes although less common it can also be transmitted through aerosol meaning airborne most likely when you have people in an enclosed space such as an elevator or when someone sneezes or coughs without covering their mouth especially an elevator and then someone can inhale that aerosol and that's how that is mainly transmitted when it's done through aerosol but most of the transmission is going to be through respiratory droplets and or through contact this virus attaches to cells in our body by the ACE to receptor this h2 receptor is only located on certain cells in our body it's on our tongue it's in our nose it's in the back of our throat and it's in our lungs specifically within the lungs it's only located on our type ii alveolar cells what's that you ask let's take a closer look at our lungs all right so we're gonna deep dive into this power point that I created and we're gonna start off by getting into the lungs here is our windpipe aka the trachea this is going to divide into our right mainstem bronchus and this is our left mainstem bronchus and just like branches on a tree these gonna keep branching the smaller and smaller branches same thing with this long and then eventually it's gonna bring so small that it's gonna become like that the leaves on the tree and this is called the alveolus here alveolus is me comprised of type 1 alveolar cells that is what actually forms a structure of the alveolus here but that's not everything the other kind of cell is the type 2 alveolar cell and that's this thing right here and that's important because that's where the taste to accept is located within our alveoli this right here is a macrophage this is a kind of white blood cell macro means big and then phage means to eat this yellow stuff right here is called surfactant it's like lubrication for the alveoli it's very important to keep the lvi oh oh the alveoli open but also it's important to make sure that the alveoli is not too stiff so that's lubrication makes it nice and smooth here we have a fibroblast this is a cell that is responsible for maintaining the structure of the lung tissue and they also do maintenance shut up - all the maintenance people custodians thank you very much this right here is a capillary this is a pulmonary capillary and you can see it's gonna come in close proximity to the alveolus and this is where gas exchange occurs so when we breathe in air comes down here the oxygen and air is gonna diffuse through the type 1 alveoli into a capillary and go into the red blood cell and carbon dioxide is gonna go from our red blood cell carbon dioxide to co2 it's gonna diffuse from the red blood cell through this membrane then through this membrane and then into the alveoli and then we're gonna exhale that co2 it's gonna go up that way now besides this red blood cell you see you also have a neutrophil here that's another kind of white blood cell think of a neutrophil as like the police or the military they're just coming by here and they're just making sure everything is all good not needed here and then just gonna keep on moving through here and notice of what this white blood cell this neutrophil is much bigger compared to the red blood cell now let's look at how the virus gets into this alveolar cell this type to alveolar cell as I said before the type 1 viola don't have these h2 receptors but the type to do have them so the coronavirus are gonna come down to the type 2 alveolar cell and is gonna go up to the receptor anybody like and then this h2 receptor is like well it's a good fit it's a good bind here so let's the corona virus into the house and the next thing you know he's asking if she wants eggs for breakfast so at this point the corona virus enters a cell the type 2 alveolus and we have the D I'm sorry the RNA of the virus here and then it's gonna unravel and it's gonna make copies of its own messenger RNA and then it's also going to use that messenger RNA that it has and use the cell machinery to make proteins so it's gonna make the proteins for Spike protein that's gonna make different parts of proteins for different parts of its cell the bottom line is it's gonna replicate itself and make multiple copies and then this new corona virus that's formed is gonna go and attack other type ii alveolar cells now this is important because it's gonna trigger a cascade of reactions it's gonna trigger this cytokine storm but it's also gonna down regulate this ace 2 receptor which is very important and I'll explain that a little bit at some point the nucleus of the cell which is right here is gonna recognize that this whole process of the virus replicating itself this is not supposed to be here this is a foreign invader and it's gonna trigger a release of chemicals that send a distress signal this is the initiation of the cytokine storm the other thing this virus is affecting this nucleus when it comes to the down regulation of this base 2 receptor this is an enzyme in the body that serves a specific purpose and we're gonna talk about the importance of that in a little bit so as I mentioned the distress signals that are being sent in the cytokine storm that's gonna be il-1 il-6 I'll eat in aisle 29 these are all very important but I want you to pay attention to aisle 6 now IL stands for no clothes Ken but it's actually interleukin the down regulation of this ace to receptor is so important because as if the cytokine storm isn't bad enough triggering all the inflammation that's about to happen the other thing is it does this when there's down regulation of the h2 there's less ability to convert angiotensin 2 to injure tensed 1-7 and there's also less ability to convert angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 1-9 why is this important take a closer look angiotensin again is a protein made in the liver renan is a protein made in the kidneys renin is an enzyme that converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin one angiotensin one is converted to angiotensin 2 by this enzyme angiotensin converting enzyme these two molecules by way of the h2 enzyme are converted to angiotensin 1-9 into tensed 1-7 this is very important because this pathway here is going to lead to vasodilation meaning the blood vessels the pulmonary arteries get dilated when there's more into your tent and two and less into tenths of one seven this is what happens the angiotensin one receptor gets stimulated and that leads to base of constriction leads to more information and more fibrosis so we want the balance of this cascade this series of reactions to be shifted more towards this way and less towards this way but that's not what's happening with this virus in between the cytokine storm in between the down regulation of this ace two enzyme and what ultimately happens is you have more angiotensin 2 in the lungs and less angiotensin 1-7 this is gonna trigger a crazy chaotic reaction within the lungs okay back to our type 2 alveolar cell here remember when we were talking about this things are normal before but now they're not so normal remember we talked about this cell releasing these cytokines this il-6 this I'll aid this il-1 I'll 29 and also the down regulation of h2 well that's gonna trigger all this chaos to happen the red blood cells come in here but guess what remember that neutrophil we talked about it's actually attracted to these chemicals better released so it's gonna find its way into this alveolar space and here it is here and it's gonna release more chemicals leukotrienes pif oxidants proteases these all destroy stuff they destroy cells remember this guy the macrophage means big eater well guess what just like Guns and Roses he's now got an Appetite for Destruction he's gonna release tnf-alpha il-6 i'll a il-1 destroying stuff just eating everything in its path the alveolar wall here that's gonna be destroyed through all this destruction this membrane here of the endothelium that's gonna be destroyed fluid is gonna seep from this capillary into the alveolus all this yellow stuff here that's all fluid all this pink stuff that's hyaline membrane that's protein deposition proteins are being deposited there and also because of the destruction in this membrane here the red blood cells they're gonna leak into there that's called bleeding this fibroblast is gonna make more destructive stuff more cytokine storm il8 it's gonna lay down pro collagen which is the precursor to collagen that's gonna bleed to scarring in the area this is all bad stuff this is what it looks like underneath the microscope this is normal this is normal alveoli underneath the microscope this is what it looks like with ARDS from COVID 19 this was actually taken from a patient who died of COVID 19 and you can see what I was talking about the Highland membrane formation that deposition of all those proteins and cellular debris it's all crazy here right and then you have lymphocytes the white blood cells in here and then you have this is of the other lung the same patient you have a big macrophage here and all these lymphocytes spread throughout with this hyaline membrane deposition this is chaos this looks like the end of Avengers endgame in a final scene this is a normal chest x-ray okay here we have the heart we have the vertebrae here we have the ribs okay we have the diaphragm that's the biggest muscle that controls your breathing okay you have a scapula here the collarbone the clavicle there all right now all this black that represents air that normal this kind of white hazy stuff that's the pulmonary blood vessels okay that's all normal then this happens from a COVID patient with aired yes look at all that it's hardly any black there all the air is gone all right how is that oxygen supposed to get into or through the alveoli into the pulmonary capillary how is that supposed to happen this is a cat scan of a normal person normal lungs okay so they're laying down on their back here alright and then you're standing at their feet and you're looking towards their head and this is a thin slice in cross-section the black stuff represents air and this white stuff is actually the pulmonary vessels the pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins alright so this is normal this is the CT scan of someone with air - yes there's some normal lung in here but there's also areas of ground glass of pacification that's partial or pacification or partial filling of the alveoli and then you see it's more dense here okay that's complete or pacification that's complete filling of the alveoli with fluid and inflammation now as if this isn't bad enough where the alveoli are either partially or completely filled with fluid and inflammation and protein and all that stuff well what I didn't mention to you before was these purple dots here that represents very tiny thrombi very tiny clots that form as a result of all this inflammation what does that do that's gonna clutter those little capillaries that's gonna clutter the blood flow that goes to the lungs and as if that's not bad enough there's another thing that's very very bad when it comes to ARDS especially in COVID 19 patients and that has to do with pulmonary hypertension meaning the pulmonary arteries that go to the lungs they're gonna constrict and that's not good the reason why they're constricting so much at least part of the reason why is because they have angiotensin ii so much angiotensin ii related to that ACE 2 receptor down regulation so this increase in angiotensin 2 is going to cause the blood vessels to constrict and that makes it harder for the right side of the heart to pump and this is going to ultimately mean less oxygenation than normal as if oxygenation wasn't a big enough problem already now we've got a third reason why the oxygenation is gonna be so bad let's review our heart physiology so the pulmonary vein this is the blood that's coming back from the lungs it's gonna be oxygenated because the blood that goes to the lungs gets oxygenated there so now it's coming back and it's gonna go into the left atrium of the heart then it goes to the left of ventricle to heart then it's gonna be pumped out to the body through the aorta and this blood gets pumped to the body it's gonna go to the brain it's gonna go to the intestines to the kidneys it's gonna go to your legs to your arms to your muscles more if it goes to your muscles when you're working out let's say you drain your biceps blood is rushing into your muscles and that's would record a pump Thank You Arnold now when the blood comes back from the body from those places that I just mentioned it's gonna come back through the vena cava the biggest fan in the body there's a superior vena cava and an inferior vena cava and that's gonna land that blood into the right atrium then the blood from the right atrium is gonna go to the right ventricle and then to the pulmonary artery and then from the pulmonary artery it's gonna be sent off to the lungs to go pick up oxygen again because it's deficient in oxygen but the problem like a dis mention is now that vasoconstriction of those pulmonary arteries that's gonna lead to less blood flow getting to the lungs so there's less blood flow that can get oxygenated and so what ultimate is gonna happen is you're gonna have even lower oxygen levels than you would expect normally with ARDS because of that reason so there's really three reasons why patients with ARDS have such a difficult time with oxygenation ones because of all the inflammation from air ds2 is because the micro thrombi that developed this tiny little clots that form in the capillaries and three is this pulmonary vasoconstriction it's pulmonary hypertension that develops and ultimately the oxygen levels are just gonna drop very very low now there's a lot of people asking about ACE inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers so ACE inhibitors are things like captopril of sinop rael ramipril and due attention receptor blockers are things like losartan Telma Sartain candy Sartain or bizarre tan here's how these things work ACE inhibitors inhibit the ACE enzyme so there's gonna be a blockage in this part of the cascade and what happens here is if you put a roadblock here that's gonna shift this sequence to this way alright it's gonna go down that way now if you have a blockade right here in this part of the pathway by an angiotensin receptor blocker such as a low start in these medications inhibit binding to this receptor here alright so if you inhibit it here it's gonna shift everything towards this way and towards this way and you're gonna have this right here that's good that's what we want we want to dilate those pulmonary arteries we want to reduce inflammation we want to reduce fibrosis that's good so that's why I think the trials that these medications are in right now for over 19 I think we're gonna have great results of that but only time will tell and everything I just mentioned to you about a stew in angiotensin 2 in angiotensin 1-7 this is all backed by small studies going back 10 years ago or so and there's even more so in the last couple of years because this is a very hot area of research and I'll show you some of the studies real quick you got this one this one there's the intensive one seven how it relates to here yes and a type ii alveolar cells there's just lots and lots of studies they have to do with exactly what I'm talking about so how do we get COVID 19 patients with ARDS how do we get these patients better it's gonna be a combination of things including individualizing various ventilator settings including adjusting the tidal volume and adjusting the peep it's also gonna involve trying different ventilator modes with assist control possibly aprv it's gonna involve proning patients meaning lying patients on their chest instead of their back it's gonna include the possibility of using pulmonary vasodilator such as inhaled nitric oxide or process cycling for IV eople process and all flow and it's gonna vol the possibility of steroids possibly ECMO and of course the medications that are coming out for COVID 19 veteran clinical trials and some are more promising than others and that's going to be the topic of my next video okay so we know that ARDS develops in about four to five percent of patients with COVID 19 and all these people who get COVID 19 the mortality rate is around one to two percent so why do some COVID patients get ARDS and why do some die it could be one of these reasons but more likely it's a combination of these reasons so here we go number one the virus only gains entry into our cells that Express the ACE 2 receptor they're located in multiple sites besides being in your lung during your mouth nose throat stomach during their small intestine the colon skin not on the outside of the skin but on the underneath the skin lymph nodes thymus bone marrow spleen liver kidneys brain and one more place yeah that's right there in your testes if you have those all right number two it makes sense that if the virus only gets into your mouth or nose or throat but not the lungs that it recalls only cold like symptoms but if the virus gets all the way down into your alveoli your lungs specifically the type 2 alveoli that's where you're gonna have ARDS potentially developed and by the way the ace 2 receptors that are in your gut probably explained by some patients end up getting nausea vomiting diarrhea okay number three the amount of virus that you get into your body likely determines how sick you get this is what we call the viral load and this was demonstrated in this study number four the inflammatory reaction that occurs with COVID 19 is extremely complicated with lots of different proteins and hormones in interleukins at play but there are several known genetic polymorphisms of these proteins that make the illness potentially worse than others a genetic polymorphism simply means a variation on a particular gene for example there are genetic polymorphisms of the ACE gene not the ACE 2 but the ACE gene as well as il-6 basically a lot of it comes down to our genes and sex because the fifth reason has to do with estrogen estrogen is known to inhibit the effects of il-6 which plays a huge role in the cytokine storm this might explain why women overall have less severe disease compared to men see ladies aren't you glad you don't have and the sixth reason has to do with some people are already on medications that might impact COVID 19 for people who are already on ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril or an ARB such as losartan or telma start an whatever or people who take hydroxychloroquine for lupus or rheumatoid disease are people who take tousle ISM AB in il-6 receptor inhibitor are these patients less prone to getting severe illness my guess is yes and now I know there's a theory circulating out there about how the virus might be attacking our hemoglobin the theories based on this non peer-reviewed study that showed that the virus in a test tube not on our body or in animals but in the test tube could attack hemoglobin which is in our blood specifically it's speculated that it might attack the beta 1 chain of hemoglobin in our blood even if it could attach to the beta 1 chain of hemoglobin I can tell you that it's not the way the virus is causing disease we know this for several reasons one we know abides to the h2 receptor in gates entry into our cells that way too we see that with our own eyes the destruction that it causes to the alveoli on the pathology number three we know that the COVID 19 patients have a low P to F ratio which means that the reason for low oxygen is because the lungs reduced ability to move oxygen from the air into your bloodstream and people who have low oxygen levels due to an issue with the hemoglobin for example with methemoglobinemia they have a normal p2f ratio patients with met him aglow of anemia have a low oxygen saturation but in normal PDF ratio in COVID 19 ARDS these patients have a low p2f ratio okay number four the red blood cell does not have h2 receptors located on it so the virus is not able to invade the red blood cell number five hemoglobin normally does not exist outside of the red blood cell except when the red blood cell bursts what we call hemolysis and COVID 19 patients were not seeing any hemolysis therefore there's no way the virus is able to attack hemoglobin except for perhaps a very tiny bit of hemoglobin that can exist in alveoli as a result of the alveolar damage from ARDS,How COVID Kills Some People But Not Others - Doctor Explaining

5,"NARRATOR: The inside story of how the outbreak began in the United States.  The reason Washington State found that first case cause we were ready for it.  NARRATOR: Correspondent Miles O'Brien on the ground with those who detected it first.  Within the first five days we had 32 positives. We then knew that this was a much bigger outbreak than you could have imagined.  NARRATOR: And, the tale of two Washington's.  That governor is a snake. Okay. Inslee.  We are not going to be distracted by any rhetoric that the President or anyone else uses. Facts and science. That's the only thing that's going to get us through this.  NARRATOR: Now on FRONTLINE, “Coronavirus Pandemic”. (seagulls squawking, siren blaring)  It was one of the most vibrant cities in America. Our economy was strong, a port that was one of the leading ports in the country. We had one of the most vibrant restaurant scenes, small businesses flourishing. And we went from that to almost zero overnight. (ship horn blares)  MILES O'BRIEN: I arrived in Seattle in mid March, a city and state in the process of shutting down before that was the norm in the rest of the country. I've covered science stories for nearly 30 years, but this felt more like science fiction. The deadly disease COVID-19 was about to bring the country and the world to its knees.  It's like watching a slow-moving landslide move towards you.  O'BRIEN: How did it evade our warning systems, our best science?  A lot of people died because we weren't ready.  O'BRIEN: Why was our government so slow to act, so unprepared?  I haven't cried ever as much as I have in the last week.  O'BRIEN: And what lies ahead? ? ? ? ? I came to Seattle looking for answers. My first stop... How are you? ...Providence Regional Medical Center in nearby Everett.  And have you traveled outside the U.S. in the last 30 days?  I have.  Okay, so we're gonna ask you to put on a mask.  O'BRIEN: Okay. This is the hospital that treated the first known case of COVID-19 in the country.  There we go, 97.6.  O'BRIEN: I met Dr. George Diaz, an expert in infectious diseases who treated patient one-- a 35-year-old local man who'd flown into Seattle on January 15.  He was having a cough, he had been having fevers at home, he hadn't been eating well, he generally felt poorly and he had been complaining of diarrhea at home.  O'BRIEN: He is 35 years old and otherwise healthy.  Totally healthy person. He began developing symptoms the day after he arrived.  O'BRIEN: He went to this walk-in clinic and described his symptoms and told them where he had been for about six weeks: Wuhan, China.  A preliminary investigation into a mysterious pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, has identified...  O'BRIEN: That was a crucial detail.  The mysterious new pneumonia virus has sickened dozens of people...  O'BRIEN: For weeks, Wuhan had been the center of a growing storm.  Scientists in China trying...  O'BRIEN: ...as news trickled out about cases of a strange new pneumonia.  Still a lot that is unknown, the W.H.O. has said...  O'BRIEN: In Seattle, a city known for cutting-edge medicine and technology as well as ties to Asia, officials told me they had been on alert.  It clearly had the attention of our public health folks, and they in turn were starting to line up the other departments, starting with Human Services, about how we're going to respond when and if it arrived on our shores.  O'BRIEN: At the clinic where the man returning from Wuhan was seeking treatment, they took no chances.  At that point the clinic appropriately isolated him. The health district contacted the CDC, who advised testing. And fortunately that clinic had the appropriate gear to be able to safely test the patient. He was then advised to go home and quarantine.  O'BRIEN: The clinic sent a nasal swab they'd taken from the man to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.  And then, within 24 hours, we had a call from the CDC saying that the test was positive and that they wanted us to admit him for observation.  O'BRIEN: The first COVID-19 patient had been confirmed in the United States. Around 10:00 p.m. on January 20, patient one was brought to the Providence Regional Medical Center. This is a photograph of his arrival, encased in what's called an isopod, designed to keep a patient quarantined.  Patient number one arrived here in this?  He did. When we were going through the transportation plan with the ambulance company, they wanted to keep their staff safe. Completely contained, doesn't allow any possibility of infection. So our patient was placed in this by EMS and brought to our hospital and unloaded in his room. So, it took us about two hours from the time the CDC called for us to get all our staff personnel, supplies, and the facilities all in place to be able to give the EMS folks the greenlight to come in.  O'BRIEN: You did that in two hours?  In two hours. We were ready for it.  O'BRIEN: One of the reasons they were so ready: less than three weeks earlier, Diaz and his colleagues had conducted an elaborate simulation-- pandemic training.  We were aware of what was going on in Wuhan at that point, but it was part of our routine structure already to prepare.  O'BRIEN: You really had a go-to plan.  We had a game plan in place already. We had everyone involved, including the local EMS, those people that bring the patients from point A to point B, public health officials, and other partners we have in the community to drill. So we had a variety of scenarios we went through.  O'BRIEN: By the time patient one was hospitalized, local public health officials were going into high gear.  The reason Washington state found that first case 'cause we were ready for it. The ambulance service was ready, they knew the right personal protective equipment to wear, it was one of those absolute coordination between the health care, local health, state health, and the CDC. It went perfectly. That's how we were able to find the first case in the country.  O'BRIEN: It was a critical early warning sign that the highly contagious coronavirus could be spreading in the U.S. But in his first public comments, President Trump dismissed any threat to the rest of the country.  Have you been briefed by the CDC?  I have.  Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?  No, not at all. And we're... we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.  All right. Safe travels...  Thank you.  ...on your way back.  O'BRIEN: In Seattle, doctors and scientists weren't so sure-- they didn't have a way to test for coronavirus on their own. And while the CDC had been able to test the sample from patient one, it didn't yet have a test it could deploy on a massive scale around the country.  The way to really know the burden of disease in your community is to be able to test. So the testing piece was a huge piece of the puzzle that we didn't really fully... we weren't fully able to address.  O'BRIEN: By early February, with the virus spreading around the globe, the World Health Organization was recommending test kits that had been developed in Germany. But U.S. officials made a fateful decision to go their own way.  If you look at a moment when the United States may have lost its ability to control what's happening, it begins with the decision early on in 2020 by the CDC not to utilize the test kits and the capabilities that were being shared by the World Health Organization and other nations.  O'BRIEN: The CDC wouldn't talk to me on camera, but told me they took the swiftest path and using another nation's test would have caused worse delays. Former CDC director Tom Frieden said the decision made sense.  There's never been a time previously when there was a need to use a test from outside because the CDC system has not failed in the past.  O'BRIEN: The CDC began shipping its own test kits to public health labs around the country. But in Seattle and elsewhere, it was quickly obvious that something was wrong. One of the three chemical probes was faulty, generating inconclusive results.  There were checks and balances within the test. And when we validated can it detect the virus and can it not overdetect it, that balance was not correct.  Research and implementation laboratories said, you know, ""This doesn't work. You've given us a bogus kit, and we're not going to use it. Fix it, fast. You know, or give us the right to use our own kits.""  O'BRIEN: At the University of Washington I met virologist Alex Greninger, who'd been trying to do just that.  You got to have the supply of testing, absolutely do. We need to be able to detect where the virus is and then try and snuff it out, I mean, right? Prevent its transmission, that's the name of the game in the coming months.  O'BRIEN: But he ran into a bureaucratic brick wall: the Food and Drug Administration had instituted emergency procedures to make sure any new tests were accurate.  You can make your own tests, but you have to send it to the FDA and get it reviewed and then authorized. And I'll admit, I'm in my first couple of years here in this particular job, I had not been through this process before.  O'BRIEN: The FDA application was 28 pages long, and required him to run tests that would take at least two weeks. And that wasn't all.  One of the things is they needed a document FedEx-ed across the country before they could look at the document.  O'BRIEN: You couldn't electronically transmit it?  I could electronically transmit it, but they couldn't look at it until it was FedEx-ed. And then they changed that regulation. And so from a couple days after February 4 all the way to February 26, they didn't have a test, they were completely blind, too.  O'BRIEN: This had to be incredibly frustrating.  It was frustrating, it was. So we try to prioritize things in the top tier.  O'BRIEN: The FDA told me it did review Greninger's application but it was incomplete. They also said they were balancing the need for tests with concerns about accuracy.  Major developments, a global health emergency as the coronavirus reaches its 20th country.  O'BRIEN: In Seattle and and around the world, the clock was ticking.  The coronavirus is now considered a global health emergency and the US is warning people not to travel to China.  O'BRIEN: The W.H.O. had declared a global emergency, and the CDC was beginning to screen passengers at U.S. airports, including Seattle.  We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China.  O'BRIEN: President Trump was still not raising alarms, though he banned foreign travelers from China.  My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.  O'BRIEN: But, by that time, flights from the outbreak zone had been landing at U.S. airports for weeks.  The travel ban may have bought us some time, but in all actuality, you know, people were leaving Wuhan, going to Beijing, traveling to Western Europe and ultimately to the United States in late 2019 and early 2020 anyway.  Chinese health officials said today another 46 people have died from the coronavirus.  O'BRIEN: In those critical first weeks after the arrival of the virus in the U.S., administration officials-- and the president himself-- continued to insist that the risk was small.  I want to emphasize that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize that the risk to the American public currently is low.  How concerned are you?  Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China. We've offered China help, but we can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus. So we're gonna see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.  O'BRIEN: That attitude didn't sit well with Washington's senior Democratic senator Patty Murray. She spoke to me from her home.  I felt like at the time I lived in two different worlds. I lived here in Washington state, where people were going, ""Oh, my gosh, we have a problem,"" and in Washington D.C., where they'd say, ""Oh, you guys worry too much out in the West Coast.""  O'BRIEN: A tale of two of Washingtons.  Yeah. We should have pulled out all the stops and checked everything, but it was more like, ""Oh, you guys quit worrying out there.""  O'BRIEN: There was a lot to worry about. In isolation at Providence Hospital, patient one was deteriorating.  He began developing more shortness of breath. And because of that we got an x-ray which looked like he had a developing pneumonia. His oxygen levels in his blood were also decreasing.  O'BRIEN: That worried Dr. Diaz, who'd been following the dire medical reports out of Wuhan.  It appeared, based on their data, that once patients begin developing pneumonia that many of them end up in the ICU on a ventilator and die.  O'BRIEN: Patient one was slipping fast, and there was no known treatment. Dr. Diaz told me he'd heard about an antiviral drug called Remdesivir that some experts thought could potentially help. It would be an experiment, he said, but the patient was willing.  At that point, I contacted the FDA and Gilead, the manufacturer, to see if they would approve it. So the FDA gave us an approval to try it on a compassionate use basis, knowing that it had not been approved yet and that there were no trials available to base that decision on. We infused it the next day. He was still having very high fevers and still was requiring oxygen the day that we gave it to him. By the next day, his fevers resolved and they stayed gone. He felt much better. He felt like he had started beating the virus.  O'BRIEN: No one knew if the drug had an impact, or if the virus was taking its natural course. Here's the thing, you have one data point here.  One person in the world.  O'BRIEN: Yeah, in the world.  It was an anecdote, and so we were happy that the patient got better and was ultimately continuing to get better, able to go home. So that part was fantastic for the patient. We knew then that we needed to study this in a formal clinical trial.  O'BRIEN: Although patient one was well enough to be sent home, for public health officials in Washington state, there were many more questions to answer. They needed to find out who patient one might have come in contact with after returning from China and send samples from them to the CDC as well.  So, we find contacts, someone that you spend at least ten minutes of time talking face to face with. We identified 60-plus contacts. We swab them multiple times to see was there a transmission of this virus. And we found absolutely no transfer amongst those contacts that this first case had.  O'BRIEN: Washington's governor, Jay Inslee, remembers this as a brief, optimistic moment. I interviewed him remotely from his office at the state capitol.  What we were thinking is we were very much on top of it because we did very extensive contact tracing with all of the contacts that the person had who was the first patient and did everything epidemiologically that you could ask a public health system to do.  O'BRIEN: But soon more signs of trouble began to appear across Lake Washington in the city of Kirkland at the Life Care skilled nursing and rehab center. Scott Sedlacek had brought his 86-year-old father there to recover from a bad fall.  So, he hit his head hard enough that he had some brain trauma and bleeding on the brain and he broke his right ankle. And the bed that opened up was at Life Care. And so, on February 20, we moved my dad to Life Care. And then we started seeing some of the staff wearing respiratory gear, wearing face masks, wearing gloves. It's kind of like, ""What's going on?""  O'BRIEN: Inside Life Care, residents had been getting sick with an unknown respiratory infection. The sickest were brought to the nearby EvergreenHealth Medical Center. Dr. Francis Riedo is the medical director of infection control here.  Remember, this was flu season. And we'd already had a peak of influenza B in December, and now we were going through the peak of influenza A. And so the unit was full of individuals with severe respiratory infections. In the meantime, in the background, we're watching these events unfold with increasing alarm, not only in Wuhan, and now spreading across the globe and wondering when our turn was coming.  O'BRIEN: Until that point, federal guidelines for testing potential cases were very narrow-- patients had to have been in a hotspot like China or in contact with someone infected. Then, the rules changed. Dr. Riedo wasted no time.  We settled on two individuals and we tested them the following morning. I had a regular day, saw patients in clinic, saw patients in the hospital, was sitting there as I usually do trying to complete my notes and received a call at 7:40 p.m. And both of the tests were positive.  O'BRIEN: What goes through your mind?  My initial honest response was skepticism. I thought the odds of both tests in two randomly selected individuals being positive with no history of travel, no history of exposure to anybody was fairly astronomical. This was a huge shift. Incident command was activated and we made a quick decision to test nine additional people that night. Eight of those nine were positive.  O'BRIEN: Wow.  Right.  O'BRIEN: Kind of stunning actually, isn't it?  It was, and within the first five days, we had 32 positives.  O'BRIEN: Many were from Life Care, but crucially, some had no connection to the nursing home.  We then knew that this was a much bigger outbreak than you could have imagined.  O'BRIEN: At least 41 Life Care residents and two visitors would eventually die with more than a hundred others linked to the home testing positive, including Scott Sedlacek's father, Chuck.  He has never shown symptoms.  O'BRIEN: So, how worried are you that symptoms might appear?  Extraordinarily. Because we don't know, this is new, it's uncharted waters.  O'BRIEN: The Sedlaceks' story hit home for me: my 84-year-old father is in assisted living in Florida. Hello there. Can you tilt down a little bit?  I'm sorry what?  O'BRIEN: Tilt down, tilt down, a little more down. There you go, that's good. How you feeling?  Well, I'm fine, how are you?  O'BRIEN: No coronavirus so far, but he's pretty much in isolation, no visitors allowed. It's the same at Life Care, but the Sedlaceks have found a way around that.  My sister is here and we'll go up and will say hi through the window. We brought a big white board today so we can actually write notes for him because they're double pane windows to seal the noise out. (laughs) Can you hear us? (laughs)  Okay, we'll let you finish that-- love you.  Keep getting better, keep listening to the nursing staff. They're looking out for you. He has to get the love from the family to get better. Without it, he will become not just physically but mentally ill.  O'BRIEN: Yeah.  It's the worst thing you can do to an older person.  O'BRIEN: Yeah, right.  Yeah, the worst thing you can do.  O'BRIEN: Scott himself also got the virus. Unlike his dad, he got sick.  I was hospitalized through the emergency room with the full-blown list of symptoms-- extraordinary difficulty breathing, light-headed, dizziness-- you name the symptom, I had it.  O'BRIEN: What was it like being in isolation, sick with this disease? Were you scared?  Hell yes, I was scared, it's an unknown. I was hooked up to an IV and they started an albuterol nebulizer, which they had to give two full rounds of it. But after those two full rounds, I was breathing normally and after six hours, they had all my symptoms under control. Within 12 hours, they moved me to a full isolation unit, and ten hours later, they released me with zero symptoms.  The number of coronavirus cases at home and abroad continue to climb, the financial markets rocked, and more aggressive steps to fight the spread...  O'BRIEN: By this time in early March, COVID-19 cases were multiplying here and around the country.  Breaking news-- Washington is in a state of emergency...  O'BRIEN: Governor Inslee had put Washington under a state of emergency...  Washington state has declared a state of emergency...  O'BRIEN: ...the first governor to do so.  The governor declaring a state of emergency...  O'BRIEN: But like many here, he was increasingly concerned that President Trump was continuing to downplay the threat.  It's going to all work out. Everybody has to be calm. It's all going to work out.  O'BRIEN: Inslee, a Democrat and former presidential candidate, tweeted that the administration should stick to science and tell the truth. It would ignite an escalating war of words.  O'BRIEN: During a visit to the CDC, Trump fired back.  That governor is a snake. Okay. Inslee. Let me just tell you, we have a lot of problems with the governor and... the governor of Washington, that's where you have many of your problems. I said, no matter how nice you are, he's no good. That's the way I feel.  O'BRIEN: At that point, did you get the sense that you as governor and the state of Washington was sort of on their own and the federal cavalry was not coming?  Yes, but we didn't ever depend on that leadership coming out of the White House, so it's not something that we were surprised by. We always knew that we would have to lead the charge, given the president's reluctance to really exercise leadership on this. And we sort of knew that he had an intent of downplaying what was an emerging problem. That, you know, could only be explained by someone who had their eye on the Dow Jones rather than an eye on the epidemiological curve.  O'BRIEN: Seattle's mayor, Jenny Durkan, shared those sentiments.  We are not going to be distracted by any rhetoric that the president or anyone else uses. We've got to act. We've got to act to protect the people and I think those actions are what matters. Facts and science. Got to rely on them. That's the only thing that's going to get us through this, and, fortunately, we've got a really vibrant health and science community here in the state of Washington and Seattle and we listen to them.  O'BRIEN: She and other political leaders here had some hard decisions to make after hearing grim predictions.",Coronavirus Pandemic _ FRONTLINE Part 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJtjyB1gvE,22261,general
6,"We had researchers here telling us that within six weeks, we would have over 70,000 positive cases and hundreds of deaths if we didn't act. And so we had a choice to make. The choice was know that you're going to have enormous pain in shutting down parts of your economy, or have those same impacts later and overrun your health system. As we move forward, it will be increasingly necessary and important that we are unified in our efforts.  O'BRIEN: Seattle was starting on a trajectory that the rest of the country would soon follow.  There is no magic silver bullet at the moment medically, but there is a very successful effort that we can take to slow the spread of this disease and that's to reduce the social interactions that are not necessary in our lives.  O'BRIEN: You, the county executive, and the governor, were early out of the box on taking these actions, pretty proactive. Did you feel at the time a little nervous about all that?  I think it was... all of us felt a great deal of... sense of obligation and concern because we were the first to go.  O'BRIEN: Mayor Durkan actually had a pandemic response plan on the shelf, which she and her cabinet had updated in early February.  We pulled out the pandemic planning and knew that one of the first things we had to do to separate people from another was have them telecommute, those that could. So our largest employers acted immediately.  O'BRIEN: That included Seattle icon Microsoft, with a workforce of more than 50,000 one of the largest private sector employers in the region.  So, we had a call on Sunday afternoon, March 1. We had the business leaders...  O'BRIEN: Microsoft president Brad Smith spoke to me from his home.  We went from Monday telling people they should work from home if they were more comfortable, Tuesday telling people, you know, feel free to work from home, it might be better, to Wednesday work from home unless it's essential you come to work.  O'BRIEN: The decision you made was a big one. Did you hesitate?  No, it was interesting. Once we decided at Microsoft that we would be decisive and base our decisions on public health advice, then we knew what to do.  It's the hardest decision I've ever had to make because all of our instincts are to grow the whole economy for your city, to make a stronger community for everyone. And what we're saying is we've got to stop that kind of community and we have to stop doing work.  O'BRIEN: Almost overnight, the vibrant city shut down-- businesses closed, storefronts boarded up, empty restaurants, the famous Pike Place Market nearly deserted. ? ? At a local soccer field usually filled with kids and families, preparations for a surge of COVID patients.  We knew already that one of the biggest challenges would be having the hospital system overwhelmed by a wave of cases. We were trying to figure out how we could get testing, we were trying to figure out whether we would receive material help in the form of field hospitals or large facilities encampments for people who were unhoused. And there wasn't a lot of concrete offers of help coming from the federal government. So we were left with the reality that we're going to have to take on a lot of this ourselves.  More than 140 people lost their lives yesterday, bringing the death toll to over 590 in this country.  He's not doing everything he can do.  O'BRIEN: As coronavirus was sweeping the country throughout March...  And I can't tell you how frustrating it is...  O'BRIEN: ...so was the frustration among governors scrambling for resources they needed to respond.  We're bidding against one another, it's really not a great system.  All of the states are taking action to try to find these things on our own.  O'BRIEN: The president was now feuding with multiple governors...  400 ventilators? I need 30,000 ventilators.  O'BRIEN: And like he'd done with the virus in the beginning...  I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.  O'BRIEN: ...he disputed there was scarcity of crucial medical equipment, like masks and ventilators.  Many of the states are stocked up. Some of them don't admit it, but they have, we have sent so many things to them, including ventilators.  O'BRIEN: Amid the feuding, doctors and nurses have struggled to get the personal protective equipment, PPE, they need.  Good morning, and welcome, everyone.  O'BRIEN: In Seattle, that's been the top issue for Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, the chief clinical officer of the Providence Hospital Network.  Last year, across all of Providence, we used 250,000 masks. In the first three months of this at Everett, they've used 250,000 masks. We cannot have our own caregivers going down from COVID while they're trying to take care of the community, because, you know, the supply chain is just not keeping up with our needs.  Amy, I have to say if I can't assure them that they are safe then I don't think the rest of this is worth anything.  O'BRIEN: Inside Providence's emergency department, tensions around PPE have been high. Dr. Ryan Keay is the department's medical director.  It's exhausting to constantly think about the sequence that you put things on and take things off and where you're sanitizing during that sequence. Every nurse, every tech, every physician I've talked to has said, ""I've been working for years and I've never been so exhausted."" And it leaves people just on edge all the time.  We have enough N-95 masks that people should not have to be able... should not have to bring in their own masks at this point in time.  Is the recommendations still one N-95 per five patients? Or are we using it the whole shift now?  We're using them with a face shield for as long as you need to use them. You just store them in a paper bag until they become moist or soiled.  Okay, so forever?  Well, not forever. (chuckles)  O'BRIEN: Reusing masks and storing them in paper bags wasn't the only DIY workaround I saw. I caught up with Dr. Compton-Phillips at the otherwise vacant Providence headquarters. Inside a large meeting room, she and a handful of her team were spread out a safe distance, cranking out face shields.  Our caregivers would normally have protective goggles on and a surgical mask underneath this and then this goes in front and basically protects against droplets.  O'BRIEN: They had raided a half dozen craft stores to scrounge up supplies.  We're at 288 now, we're going to get to 1,000 by tomorrow.  We're retooling our resources going into war against COVID.  I feel like Rosie the riveter.  499, 500! (cheering)  O'BRIEN: On the one hand, this is really... it's kind of heartwarming. But it's also really sad.  Desperation.  O'BRIEN: Yeah, I can't decide which way to go in this. What are your thoughts?  I would rather offer our caregivers something than nothing and at the moment, you know, if the choice is not having PPE or having homemade PPE, were going to offer them homemade PPE.  O'BRIEN: Right, right.  So...  O'BRIEN: That's what motivated Jeff Kaas-- his small family business builds and sews furniture for aviation and retail customers. He decided to pitch in and start making masks. There's not a shortage of the raw materials at least, that would be... or not yet?  There will be. There will be, yeah. So, I think we've enough to make two million masks.  O'BRIEN: But how long will that take you to do?  Well, it depends on how fast we want to go.  O'BRIEN: How fast do you want to go?  We want to solve the problem. My assumption is that we will be ramping up for several weeks and then drop off a cliff. Nobody will need me in the healthcare business anymore and then survival becomes a question for my company. That's probably the next scary thing, which is less scary than what our healthcare friends are going through right now. That's the bigger issue for me.  We knew in January what we would need-- we knew. We would need gloves and masks and respirators, and ventilators. Two-and-a-half months later, we're dependent on sewing circles to supply our frontline heroes with what they need. It may be a nice American story; I find it pathetic.  O'BRIEN: Washington state officials, like others in the country, say this was an avoidable crisis.  Because we've lacked the federal leadership we needed, it's been mayor versus mayor, city versus city, state versus state, trying to get access to the limited resources to protect our communities, whether it's ventilators or masks for our health care workers, all of that has become this Hunger Games process where everyone's trying to figure out a way to outbid each other. Washington state had a line on masks that were coming to the country and at the port in California. Suddenly, multiple states were bidding on them. That shouldn't be the way that it happens.  We're searching the world for every potential warehouse that have any of this personal protective equipment. That has been a constant struggle and we are bidding against each other, and I'm sure that the suppliers are having a field day bidding the price up while states are bidding against one another. It would be much more efficient economically and otherwise if the federal government was playing a more vigorous role in that regard.  O'BRIEN: The tensions between states and the federal government have been escalating.  Another five million Americans file for unemployment benefits last week.  O'BRIEN: Not just over the response to the outbreak...  The market down ten percent in relatively short order. There's a lot of bad news still to come.  O'BRIEN: But now over what it will take to get the country up and running again.  This is a massive meltdown on a national scale.  More jobs lost in a matter of two weeks than in the entire 18 months of the Great Recession.  Our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we are calling ""opening up America again.""  O'BRIEN: The president has been pushing governors to re-open, even as soon as May 1.  Or country has to get open. And it will get open. And it'll get open safely. And hopefully quickly.  O'BRIEN: But some of them have been pushing back.  We cannot be guided by emotion. We need to be guided by where the facts on the ground, science and public health take us.  What's best for the people of Illinois, their safety and health, and listening to the scientists and the doctors.  Because if you do it wrong, it can backfire.  O'BRIEN: And many like Inslee say it will come down to one thing: mass testing.  This is the number one challenge for the United States right now, is we need a huge ramp up of our testing capacity, even greater than was needed early in the outbreak.  O'BRIEN: To increase testing, Inslee says Trump needs to order U.S. industry to help using the Defense Production Act which the President has only just begun to do.  We need the president to help ignite a national mobilization of the manufacturing base of the United States, that is absolutely imperative so that we can restart our economy.  O'BRIEN: But President Trump has also thrown this back on the states.  The governors are responsible, they have to take charge. They have to do a great job.  O'BRIEN: There are limits to what a state can do though, as I saw at Washington's health department laboratory. They can only complete about 300 tests a day, and that requires a mad scramble. The raw materials for test kits are hard to come by.  We have a lot of testing lab capability but we don't have the equipment to swab everybody's nose. I think the current status in Washington state is limited by the supplies to actually run the test.  O'BRIEN: They also don't have enough PPE for the health care workers administering the tests.  If we don't have enough gowns, gloves, masks, to treat patients, how are we going to prioritize a gown, a glove, and a mask to swab somebody? Because that is the requirement.  O'BRIEN: The state health department isn't alone in struggling to meet the demand.  We can't have that level of cross-contamination...  O'BRIEN: After getting approval for his test from the FDA, Alex Greninger has dramatically ramped up testing at the University of Washington School of Medicine Virology Lab.  For inpatients, health care workers, institutionalized populations, but mostly inpatients, people who need supportive care, we've got to get that fast turnaround time that reduces the use of protective...  O'BRIEN: Because they're in the hospital.  Yes.  O'BRIEN: On this day, they completed about 3,000 tests.  To get 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 specimens a day, you know, it takes a lot of focus.  O'BRIEN: Just like in the state lab, Greninger says it is difficult to get the raw materials he needs. One of the hardest things to find: the single use plastic tips that contain the chemicals and the specimens.  Some automated pipettors use four tips a test, and others use three and, so, just getting the tips into your facility so we can run that many tests... This is what we're looking for, basically. We tweeted at Roche and the world to get these things in, like you would tweet like Delta lost your bags or something like that, right? I mean, we have two people whose entire job right now is to manage our FedEx shipments. Basically, we blow up our hallway and it goes down to a single file. And then it takes over the next six to eight hours, we're able to actually move those boxes into our local warehouses we bought other space here in the building. It's the supply chain has been really the number one thing we do.  O'BRIEN: Despite the problems, they are still managing to return results the same day in many cases. This is crucial to keep up with a fast-moving virus and help healthcare workers on the frontlines reduce their need for personal protective equipment.  When you send a test for COVID-19, you have to treat the person as if they are infected until we give you a result that says they aren't. And during that time, you have to use all the personal protective equipment. So, the speed at which we get those test results back allows us to conserve our personal protective equipment. It really touches so many things.  O'BRIEN: So what do you envision the coming months?  I think personally right now, this will be with us for some time, a long time. There's no magic bullet just yet.  O'BRIEN: This testing marathon could go on for at least a year-- that's how long experts say it could take to develop vaccines. In the meantime, researchers are racing to finish clinical trials of several therapeutic drugs including that promising antiviral Remdesivir The one that seemed to work so well on patient one.  On trial?  Yes, he's on trial. He started on the 15th.  O'BRIEN: Dr. Diaz is now leading one of the trials with patients at Providence Hospital.  These are still anecdotes because we haven't seen the full study being completed, but we're certainly very optimistic. We want to get these questions answered as fast as possible.  O'BRIEN: And there may be another way to help people fight off the coronavirus-- using the blood of COVID survivors themselves. Hey Elizabeth, looks like you're on the mend.  Yeah, I've been recovered now for...  O'BRIEN: People like Elizabeth Schneider. She was getting ready to become the first person in Seattle to donate her plasma to researchers trying to see what natural resistance she might have developed and whether she can share it.  Scientists don't know how long we have that immunity for this particular virus. But signs so far look like, you know, we will have immunity.  O'BRIEN: Survivors' blood as therapy-- it's not a new idea. Doctors used it in 1918 in the midst of the Spanish Flu pandemic.  I do feel a little more sense of security going out and doing my day-to-day task because I have already had this.  O'BRIEN: She was among the first documented COVID-19 cases in the U.S. A microbiologist who works for a biotech company, she came down with flu symptoms on February 25, three days after attending a party. On Facebook she learned many of her friends who were there were also sick, 15 in all. She told me she and seven others ultimately tested positive for COVID-19, which brought her to this moment on this morning to the blood bank in downtown Seattle.  Hi, I am here for plasma donation.  O'BRIEN: The coronavirus antibodies in her plasma may be a way for others to fend off the virus. It's called convalescent plasma therapy.  Our goal is to get to 840 mL today.  I'm hoping that some of my plasma ends up in another patient who is suffering from COVID-19 and this could potentially save their life. ? ?  O'BRIEN: There are now signs that COVID cases may be plateauing in some places, like here.  We have had some success flattening the curve, that has taken place...  O'BRIEN: ...but also spreading to new areas of the country. Washington state recently returned more than 400 ventilators it received from the national stockpile so they could be used where they're needed more.  Governor Inslee today announced that 400 ventilators would be leaving the state of Washington.  O'BRIEN: But in recent days...  Trump's back and forth...  O'BRIEN: President Trump's feud with governors has become an all-out war.  In a series of tweets he exclaimed ""liberate Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia.""  O'BRIEN: Encouraging protests against social distancing restrictions...  Seeing these protests at state capitols...  O'BRIEN: ...even in Washington State.  ...protesters gather today in Olympia demanding that the governor act now.  Sunday's protests in Olympia is the latest in a wave of demonstrations.  These are people expressing their views, I see where they are, and I see the way they're working, they seem to be very responsible people to me.  The governor of Washington state says the president may be inciting violence.  O'BRIEN: In his own tweets, Governor Inslee said Trump was ""unhinged,"" ""off the rails,"" and ""fomenting domestic rebellion."" When I talked to Governor Inslee, he told me it's no time to be rushing to re-open.  All leaders have the biggest challenge to make sure people understand that as the sun comes up and the daffodils come out, we've got to double our efforts. Because if you relax too soon the curve just can rebound and start right back up again. The most dangerous element in my state today is the virus of complacency because we have to be just as diligent for the next several weeks as we were the last several weeks.  O'BRIEN: I wanted to know what pandemic modeler Chris Murray thought of all of this. He runs the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.  If you ask Chris Murray...  O'BRIEN: Its models are often cited by President Trump's coronavirus task force. So, really, when you think about it, Chris, there's no scenario going forward that you can envision that doesn't demand mass testing, if not testing for everyone?  The issue will be, you know, the capacity to test. Right, how many tests are practically feasible come June, state by state? And it may not be anywhere near enough to be able to do full-scale mass testing. So then if you take measures off May 1, and there's a pretty quick rebound, so by mid-July, we'd be right back to where we are now.  O'BRIEN: Really? Exactly the rate of death and hospitalization that we're dealing with?  Pretty much, yeah. So, we're not going to want to take off measures May 1, let's put it that way.  And the second wave won't be like the first wave.  O'BRIEN: That the president isn't heeding scientific warnings, once again, is causing alarm among those who've been dealing with the outbreak since the beginning.  I am pessimistic about the next few months. I think it's going to be really hard and we need to ramp up. Ramp up, hurry, we need a leader at the top who's willing to go well beyond where he is right now in saying, ""Here's what we need to do in terms of testing"" and giving people the information they need to get the economy going. Long term, I'm optimistic, but it's a long ways between here and there. ? ?  O'BRIEN: I went back one last time to where the outbreak took hold here, Evergreen Hospital, where those patients from the nursing home were treated in February. It is an apt window into where Seattle and the country are right now. I met a woman who was recovering from COVID-19, Rosanne Eskenazi.  I want to give you a kiss and stuff but I can't.  Nope.  O'BRIEN: At 63, with an immune system disease, her chances of living to see her husband Maury again were not good.  When they put her on the ventilator, I never thought I'd see her again. And I wasn't reading about people that were surviving this and coming out of this, so I was... you know, it was over.  I don't even know how many weeks it was, but I don't remember a lot.  When we brought her, when the day came that... she looked horrible. Her temperature was horrible.  It was like 105?  O'BRIEN: Oh, my God, really?  It was 105 and she was like coughing and we had the ambulance come. They sent two ambulances. This was the beginning of the COVID, you know?  O'BRIEN: You didn't really fully appreciate how bad it was, did you, because you were kind of out of it?  Yeah, I was out of it. I saw my parents, my dead parents, when I was here. I don't know whether... I was saying I don't know whether it was a dream or a hallucination. My parents were here and they were sitting across from me and they all said, you know, ""You're going to be okay. Everything's going to be okay. You're going to be okay and if something happens, your children will be fine. Everything's going to be great. You have all this family and stuff, so don't worry."" So... and it really helped me not worry. Oh, there, it says that way.  Yeah, sorry.  O'BRIEN: Rosanne was on her way home...  Bye!  O'BRIEN: But there were others still coming in, needing urgent attention. (people chattering) I met critical care and pulmonary physician Michael Bundesmann, who was focused on one particular patient.  This is a person who has multi-organ failure and ultimately required mechanical ventilation and now needs dialysis, kidney replacement therapy, they're in shock.  O'BRIEN: Three days earlier, he'd been awake, alert, joking with his doctors.  Patients come in and they look okay on one day, and some of them are kind of okay to be discharged from the emergency room, and come back a few days later much more sick. That degree of unpredictability I think is very unsettling for everybody.  O'BRIEN: Dr. Bundesmann says the pace has slackened some since the darkest days.  We could feel the curve flatten a few days ago, probably even last week. It has allowed us to be able to see patients and to take care of them at a pace that's a little more used to what our ICU can handle, volume-wise. And it's certainly made a big difference.  We are now I think at a stage where I think we can keep this pace that we have going and that's a good thing because how many people are still susceptible to this infection. It's going to be a long haul, I think. Some of the things that worry us are, you know, what happens when there's a next large outbreak in a skilled nursing facility, the next time a susceptible population gets hit within a tight community. I don't know when that's going to happen, I think that until there is some degree of herd immunity, there are going to be people out there who have to be planning this out very carefully and cautiously, when people can start returning to work, who can start returning to work, and what time frame. Because as that happens, the cases are going to start to pick up again, and we have to be there and be able to support them as best as possible without stretching the capacity of our health care system. Tough decisions for those people who have to make them.  O'BRIEN: There have now been more than three quarters of a million confirmed COVID cases in the U.S., more than 40,000 deaths. What began as a public health crisis here with patient one has become a national crisis over response, over science and politics and decisions with devastating consequences. (siren wailing) It's still a tale of two Washingtons, the story that I found when I arrived. But it's also a tale of Washington and the states, and how the country will emerge from the crisis.",Coronavirus Pandemic _ FRONTLINE Part 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJtjyB1gvE,24229,general
7,"In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively.

8,"Have you been able to get your COVID-19 jab yet? Many countries are rolling out the COVID-19 vaccines so that the pandemic will be over and we can get back to normal. If you’ve never had COVID-19, your body doesn’t know how to fight it off. Vaccines help train your immune system to recognize the virus and be ready to attack. But as we all have different immune systems, we respond differently to the vaccine and the virus. Having side effects has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the vaccine. So let's see what's going on once you get the jab. Congratulations! You’ve just had your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. For this episode, we'll be focusing on messenger RNA, or mRNA vaccines. Once it enters your body, the mRNA vaccine instructs your cells to create a spike protein. This simulates part of the SARS-CoV-2 viral structure and tricks your body into believing that it's been infected. The spike proteins will then head to the surface of your cell. Your immune cells will detect these proteins that don't belong and begin making antibodies. If you happen to catch the virus in the future, these antibodies will attach to the spike proteins on both your infected cells and the coronavirus. This will mark them for immediate termination by your immune cells. To be clear, the mRNA does not change your DNA in any way. Hear what I say? Once the spike proteins are made, your body destroys the mRNA. Five minutes after your vaccine shot, you'll feel some soreness in your arm. To be safe, the Centers for Disease Control recommends you stay at the vaccination site for at least 15 minutes in case of a severe reaction. While it's rare, you could have anaphylaxis, which is an immediate allergic response. It causes a series of symptoms such as hives or swelling. Thankfully, trained healthcare personnel will be available at every vaccination site to treat you immediately with epinephrine. And according to the CDC, you have a greater chance of being struck by lighting, around one in 500,000, than having an allergic reaction. Four hours after your vaccine, you could feel nothing at all. Lucky you. But you could also get a slight headache or a low-grade fever and feel tired. This is perfectly normal and is a sign that your immune system has kicked into action. At this point, you may experience mild symptoms as your body acclimatizes to the vaccine. You might feel tired and feverish. Be sure to get some rest and take the day off work if you need to. After about 48 hours, you should start to feel normal again. So let’s keep going. Okay, if you got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, you’d need to get your second booster shot three to four weeks after the first dose. Your immune system would be stronger than the first time. But let’s see how it goes next. After your second dose, you might feel crummy again. You could feel tired feverish and you might get the chills. These reactions are more common after the second dose of the vaccine. But they’re mainly mild to moderate and usually go away in a day or two. And two weeks after your second shot, you’d be fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus. So far, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 illness. In either case, the vaccine can prevent hospitalization and death in people who have gotten sick. So getting a vaccine is your safest path to protect yourself, your family and your community against this virus. It could also help reach herd immunity by having vaccinated people act as a barrier between non-vaccinated people and those who have been infected.

9,"As Covid-19 spreads from the coronavirus pandemic, many are doing their part by social distancing and self-isolating. But as the virus and disease progress, one big question on many people's minds is, what can we expect with regards to a vaccine? - So, there are a ton of fascinating things happening right now and tireless research looking into a vaccine. But in order to understand it, we must first talk about how vaccines work. It was in the year 1796 that the first official vaccine was created by Edward Jenner. He took a bit of the cowpox virus and injected it into a small boy. He later was able to confirm that that boy did not develop smallpox, which was a related virus. So, how exactly did this work? Typically, when you get infected with a virus, it begins taking over your cell's machinery in order to make copies of itself. But these actions eventually trigger an immune response. Your body begins creating special cells like macrophage, B cells and T cells, that not only try and destroy the pathogen but also store information about it. What it looks like, the best way to defeat it, and more. This part is specially important because if the virus ever comes back again, your body can be immediately prepared to attack it. But the body takes time to do all of this, and so, if a virus gets enough of a head start or attacks somebody with a compromised immune system, it can gain the upper hand, leading to illness or death. - This is where vaccines come in. There are many different types, but the goal of them all is to prep and train your immune system before you get an infection. It's like a practice run. That way, when your body is invaded by the real virus, it has an advantage because it already knows how to take down the invaders. Most vaccines work by injecting some aspect of a virus or bacteria into your bloodstream, depending on what strain you're trying to protect against. We're gonna focus on viruses today. Once administered into the bloodstream, even though it's not the real virus, the body reacts as thought it's a real threat. macrophages engulf the pieces, allowing T cells to recognize and bind the foreign antigen, causing them to replicate into all different kinds of immune cells and trigger something called memory cells. These stick around even after the body is done fighting, and it's these memory cells that allow for a quick response if and when the real virus shows up. - The effectiveness of vaccines have allowed us to nearly eradicate diseases like measles, until, of course, the recent vaccine hesitant movement in which kind of came back. Regardless, they are extremely powerful tools to provide immunity to the individual and to protect larger communities, and, in our ever-connected world, all of humanity. Now there is more than one type of vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines like measles, mumps, and rubeola introduce weaker or asymptomatic forms of the virus into your body, which are very effective but can't be given to people with compromised immune systems. Inactive vaccines like polio or hepatitis A use dead pathogens that have been killed by heat or chemicals. These can be used on people with already weakened immune systems. However, they aren't great for long-lasting immunity because they don't stimulate the real thing quite as well as live attenuated vaccines and often require several doses. Subunit vaccines like hepatitis B or influenza use a specific protein or carbohydrate from the pathogen that will still trigger an immune response. There are some other experimental DNA vaccines, but perhaps the most relevant is a promising new technique of vaccines called mRNA vaccines, which you may have heard about recently. That's because they are currently in development and have begun testing on humans to potentially fight the spread of Covid-19. - The private company Moderna has created a vaccine called mRNA-1273 and has enlisted 45 healthy adults to start receiving the vaccine. This is unprecedented because they've skipped the typical years of animal testing and instead are doing it at the same time as their human trials. But experts believe they received permission because they're not actually inserting a modified virus into individuals, but rather a sequence that codes for the tiny protein spikes that are on the virus that connect with human cells. The hope is that this mRNA will get processed in your cells and have them making the spike-like protein that will be on the virus, which would then trigger your immune system to kick into action and ultimately have your body prepared for when the real thing happens. They were able to get ahead on building this thing because of Chinese scientists who sequenced the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. This information was publicly released in January which has helped labs around the world start to test and build out vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 shares between 80 to 90% of its genetic material with SARS, the virus we know about from 2003. Both consistent of a strip of ribonucleic acid inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. - This means that some of the vaccine information is able to take up where the SARS vaccine left off, and I know we have said that they have already started to give this to humans but this is only to test safety, to make sure there's no negative effects, and to see if it actually creates the antibodies. Clinical trials usually take place in three phases, and the first phase is to test for safety and make sure there's no negative adverse effects. The second phase is to test for efficacy, and usually you give it to a larger amount of people in a place where the disease has taken hold. For example, they're doing it right now in Seattle. The third phase is to continue this testing in a larger expansion, now looking at thousands of people. If the vaccine does appear to be safe, Moderna is gonna ask the FDA to move on to the second phase before the first phase has technically even finished. You can start to imagine how long this is going to take. As you give people these experimental vaccines, you can't just then give them the virus and the disease. You have to let them go out and live their lives and see what happens when they may be contracted, when they maybe don't. You have to look at tested individuals next to control groups, people who didn't get the vaccine, and start to see what happens. Does it even work, does it make people unhealthy, does it do nothing? For example, in 2004, when a SARS vaccine was being tested, vaccinated ferrets developed damaging inflammation in their lungs after being infected with the virus. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before, which is how the flu vaccine is so well designed and modulated to be updated yearly. - But the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a novel pathogen in humans, which means many of the technologies that are being used to develop the vaccine are relatively untested. There are hundreds of labs all around the world making amazing headway when it comes to treatment and vaccines, some even repurposing SARS vaccine research and hoping to start clinical trials in the spring. Shout out to the Canadian scientists who isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus which will inevitably help in terms of finding treatments and vaccines going into the future. - Truthfully, it usually takes decades to make a vaccine. Every stage takes time, from sequencing the genome, to isolating the virus, to testing in vitro, to then testing in animals, going from mice to non-human primates, to starting those phases we talked about earlier. Phase one for safety, phase two for efficacy, phase three for expanding it out, before even asking for a license, and then thinking about how to make enough of the vaccine for an entire population. All of this to say that experts believe that with record-breaking time we can get a coronavirus vaccine within one to two years. Some hopeful people who think on the bright side of life and are actually thinking about some of these more experimental ways of making vaccines think we can get one as early as eight months, and some more conservative estimates have it at longer than two years. Even the vaccine that's already gone into human trials, the one we talked about from Seattle, the company Moderna, that is likely still going to take a year. And it's also important to remember that it's a private company and therefore they have private interests, so these really exciting headlines do in fact help their stock. Either way, these short timelines come with risk, not to mention that many countries around the world are trying to develop their own versions of these vaccines and if they get somewhere they're going to inoculate their own populations first. It will be a long time before we have a vaccine that is able to be used on the world's population. - We say all this not to discourage people but to help understand realistic timelines. We even have some friends that have said things like, ""Oh, we'll be out of this once they get a vaccine ""in a couple weeks."" And it's like, it doesn't work like that. Might we create therapeutics and relief for those who are infected? Yes. And might we see a record-time vaccine that comes out? That's totally a possibility as well. But we can't count on it to solve our immediate issues. And is it possible that we may never see a Covid-19 vaccine? That is a possibility as well. - It all really emphasizes the constant need for research and funding of the sciences. After the SARS epidemic of 2003 sort of died down, a lot of that research and funding money was taken out of that vaccine, which is disappointing because all of that research and money if we had continued to fund it would have been extremely helpful right now. There is now SARS vaccine because once it died down that research and funding was cut. When this pandemic eventually dies down, we need to remember our lessons of the past, which is that we need to continue to fund science and research and make sure that when these things happen again we are more prepared. We'll say it now and we'll say it again, and that is that you need to vote for science. You need to elect politicians who believe in science and who listen to scientists when it comes to policy. - In the meantime, this is why it's so important that we physically distance and self-isolate in order to flatten the curve, wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, and keep looking to legitimate sources to keep updated on news and information as well as advice. - This is an unprecedented time and it is such an important moment in history for science communication. We really think it's amazing how many people have made videos out there, how everyone has sort of taken to Twitter and Instagram to try and disseminate proper scientific information, and for that reason we are thankful. - I think we should also send a huge thank you to everyone on the front lines of this, whether it's healthcare workers. Greg's sister is literally a respiratory therapist. - Yeah, she runs ventilators. Truly one of the most important people in the world right now. - And we really wanna see that there's grocery store workers and clerks, there's scientists and researchers, there's everyone working at hospitals, and so many more that have such important roles, and we appreciate you so much. - If you have any questions, let us know.",The Coronavirus Vaccine Explained _ COVID-19,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSuxVwMkcpA,11434,vaccine
10,mrna vaccines for covid19 vaccines are substances that protect you from harmful diseases most vaccines contain parts of weakened or dead germs that trigger your immune system to fight the disease but mrna vaccines for covenanting are different they contain a substance called mrna that teaches your cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response in order to understand how these vaccines work it's important to know what mrna is and how it normally makes proteins your body needs most cells in your body have a command center inside them called the nucleus it contains genetic material called dna that consists of instructions for building and maintaining your body proteins are one of the building blocks of your body when a new body protein needs to be built instructions for building it are copied from your cell's dna and converted into a message called messenger rna or mrna then the mrna travels out of the nucleus to a protein-building machine in your cell called a ribosome as the ribosome reads the message from the mrna it builds the protein your body needs mrna vaccines take advantage of this process to help give you immunity to covid 19. each vaccine contains special mrna that provides instructions for your cells to build a harmless piece of the virus called the spike protein the spike protein is found on the surface of the sars cov2 coronavirus that causes covid19 each piece of the mrna from the vaccine is wrapped in a protective coating the vaccine is given as a shot in the upper arm in the body the mrna particles enter your cells once inside the cell the mrna travels to a ribosome using the mrna from the vaccine the ribosome makes only a piece of the spike protein from the virus after making the piece of the spike protein your cell destroys the mrna from the vaccine it's important to know that the mrna from the vaccine never enters the cell's nucleus or changes its dna in any way next your cell presents the piece of the spike protein on its surface this allows your immune cells to detect the protein and recognize that it doesn't belong there as a result your immune cells begin making antibodies as part of an immune response to the virus in the future if you catch the virus the antibodies recognize and attach to the spike protein pieces on infected cells and the spike proteins on the virus this marks them for immediate destruction by other immune cells like all vaccines the benefit of these mrna vaccines is that they give vaccinated people protection from the virus without having to get sick with covet 19. most mrna vaccines for covid19 require you to get a second shot within a few weeks sometime after getting the vaccine you may have symptoms such as a fever this is normal it means the vaccine is working to make you immune to the virus vaccines protect you your family and your community from diseases that can be dangerous or even deadly,COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine_ Will It Change My DNA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd-E95tXfsY,2901,vaccine
11,we're going to review a couple of papers that go into detail about autopsy findings in patients with disease in the heart related to Spike protein who have been previously vaccinated and specifically we're going to look at the brain and the heart in a particular case where someone died with Encephalitis we at medcram have talked extensively about the vaccines and not only their efficacy but also side effects and that goes back to April of 2021 when we covered the vaccine pause of the Johnson Johnson vaccine as it related to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis there was about six cases out of six million cases at that time and we also covered in September of 2021 in our video called coveted vaccines 10 key questions answered with Rhonda Patrick where we delved into the connection between mRNA vaccines and myocarditis as a pulmonary and critical care physician in full practice and on the faculty at two medical schools the side effects of medications are not foreign to me I use these medications all the time in the Intensive Care Unit and one of the medications that we see used often but also with side effects are blood thinners and so it was a privilege for me to be involved in research prior to the pandemic in 2017 where we looked at clinical outcomes of prolonged anticoagulation with rivaroxaban which is a blood thinner after unprovoked venous thromboembolism people who have blood clots and we don't know why they have blood clots get put on anticoagulation for a set period of time and then they are taken off of anticoagulation and so the question is how long should they be on it and whether or not they should be on it indefinitely so this was a real world study where we actually looked at patients who had discontinued anticoagulation which you see here in red and those that had continued anticoagulation clearly you can see that those that discontinue initial month period had a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than those who actually had stayed on it and so that's an important thing to see the efficacy of a medication but the flip side of it is to see the safety if we're getting benefit but also seeing worsening and side effects that's not good so we asked the same question of the same cohort except in a little different way we asked how many of these actually had major bleeding which of course we see all the time in the Intensive Care Unit when patients are put on blood thinners and as you can see here there really wasn't much difference so this was a boon this is basically a situation where there's very little risk of continuing the medication and if you continue the medication you reduce their chances of getting blood clots no-brainer in this one we came to the conclusion that continued riverox event in this case beyond the initial three or six month treatment period significantly lowered the risk of recurrent thromboembolism without a significant increase in major bleeding compared to the treatment that discontinued at three or six months and so the key here is that for any medical intervention that you're ever going to do you have to understand that there's always risk it would be very surprising to me to hear that perhaps there's never been any kind of side effects in any way shape or form to the vaccines I think that's just Preposterous any medical intervention that we do even drinking water to an excess can cause difficulties so when those side effects happen they have to be characterized and I think that's a legitimate thing and here we're going to talk about a case that was published back in October of 2022 titled a case report multifocal necrotizing Encephalitis and myocarditis after bnt-162b2 which is basically the Pfizer mRNA vaccine against covet 19. this was published recently in just October of last year it talks about a 76 year old gentleman who had gotten three doses of a covid-19 vaccine now the first one was actually the AstraZeneca the Oxford AstraZeneca which is not an mRNA vaccine but rather a DNA this one actually goes into the nucleus it is a Dental viral vaccine chimpanzee specifically according to this article when they interviewed the family they said that the patient on day one of that injection actually started to have cardiovascular side effects dose 2 which was in July of 2021 so a good two months later was actually the Pfizer vaccination and after some time it doesn't say how long after that but sometime after that there was behavioral and psychological changes and worsening of their Parkinson's disease so this patient had already been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease is not only a neurological degradation it's also a manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction and it also has cardiovascular effects so there is a confounder there in the fact that Parkinson's disease is well known to cause cardiovascular issues and neurological issues of course and autonomic issues that's the shrine Drager aspect of the parkinsonian disease and then finally in December of 2021 so a full five months later the patient had the second dose of the Pfizer biotech vaccine two weeks after that had collapsed while eating apparently the patient was continuing to do worse ever since shortly after July and then again in one week where the patient actually collapsed it was felt that the patient had had an aspiration to money that's where the patient cannot control how they swallow which is actually very common in Parkinson's disease the food goes down the wrong way and causes a pneumonia and actually that was what was seen on autopsies we'll talk a little bit a family was quizzed about this there was no symptomatic coveted disease although the paper does not mention whether or not the patient was actually ever tested for SARS cov2 infection they don't mention it so I don't believe they probably were by the way you can find this article here in this link you can also search it by title let's get into this in a little bit more detail on the lungs microscopically there was cloudy secretions they're purulent spots brittle parenchyma bilateral muco purulent tracheal bronchitis dissol is basically code words in the anatomic pathology and Pulmonary discourse for basically pneumonia copious purulent secretions that is what I would see on a bronchoscopy if I was to Bronk this patient or put a scope down into the lungs and this is basically the manifestation of a significant and very bad pneumonia which in people who are immunocompromised don't really cause a lot of symptoms unfortunately people who are older and immunocompromise when they get pneumonia they don't complain of shortness of breath they don't complain of chest pain instead they become lethargic sleepy tired and pass away I see this often so yes bilateral broth and ammonia was known in the lower lungs there was multiple stages development of lobe filling with secretions and fragile parenchyma this is basically what you would see in chronic aspiration that's exactly what you would see in Parkinson's disease as well as the patient has difficulty controlling their ability to swallow things will silently aspirate down into the lungs no surprise there but some surprises here as we go along there was actually quite a lot of findings in the heart macroscopic examination revealed manifestations of acute and chronic cardiovascular insufficiency that just means basically coronary artery disease there was a pulmonary edema so when the heart doesn't work the fluid backs up into the brain congestion chronic hepatic congestion this is one of the organs right behind the heart renal tissue edema pituitary tissue edema evidence of shock kidney disorder and so forth and so forth there was hyper contraction of cardiomyocytes there was a number of histiocytic infiltrates this just means inflammation prominent endothelial swelling this is not what you want to see and also something called coagulation necrosis as well as fibrin clots so a lot of damage going on and what they did was they started to stain the tissues to look for two things specifically one is the spike protein and the nucleocapsulin protein now why that's important is because of the following when you have the virus the virus is made up of Spike proteins which sit on the surface and has been the target of vaccines for antibodies and then there are the nucleocapsid proteins which are inside which are not the target of vaccines and so this is what a virus would look like a true virus and the vaccine of course is just going to make Spike proteins or ask your cells to make those Spike proteins nucleocapsids if they are seen are basically indicative that the virus is there and that's the important part with understanding about nucleocapsids when they stain for Spike and when they stain for nucleocapsid this is a respiratory secretion in a patient who has been infected with SARS cov2 this is not the patient that we're talking about who died and is in the autopsy and is part of the paper this is in the paper but they're showing you a control that you can stain for this you can use an antibody which has the dye Amino bin benzodine marker on it and that's what you're seeing here with this brown so what you're seeing here is antibodies against the spike protein so we're seeing spike in respiratory secretions in a patient who is positive for SARS cov2 in those same respiratory secretions we're staining for nucleocapsid proteins these are in the respiratory epithelial cells in the respiratory secretions that's primarily where the infection is taking place so that's important to understand this is the control that they're doing in this situation now let's go back to the patient that died and was getting the autopsy so when they looked at the patient's brain they did the same sort of staining here they're looking for the presence of Spike protein in the brain of the deceased patient who they never tested for SARS cov2 but what did they find as you remember he was vaccinated three times and the purpose of those three vaccinations is to make Spike protein and what are they seeing here they're seeing Spike protein here in the brain so this is lighting up on this immunohistochemical staining for SARS cov2 Spike subunit one when they do the same thing for the nucleocapsid protein it's crickets they don't see anything there's no staining whatsoever in the brain why is there no nucleocapsid protein that is up for discussion but there isn't any as we can see here on this page let's go to another specimen from the same patient also brain again we're looking for the presence of Spike and as you can see here there is Spike protein Spike protein this blue arrow by the way is not Spike protein it is actually an individual glial cell so just ignore that that is not Spike protein Amino histochemical stating again brain deceased they're looking for nucleocapsid protein and again we don't see anything there's no nucleocaps in protein staining all right let's keep going now let's look at the hearts in the same deceased patient we're looking for Spike protein and we see again Spike protein staining on immunohistochemical staining we look for nucleocapsid protein and once again we do not see any nucleocapsulin protein in that individual so what did this lead the author of this paper that was published in October to say well first of all on the autopsy the final diagnosis was this is the official death diagnosis after the autopsy bilateral bronchopneumonia undeniable because the patient was probably silently aspirating Parkinson's disease necrotic Encephalitis based on what they saw and myocarditis as well let's see what the author says they say immunohistochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens which is the spike protein and the nucleocapsid revealed that the lesions with necrotizing Encephalitis that means dying part of the brain inflammation as well as acute inflammatory changes in the small blood vessels in the brain and heart were associated with abundant deposits of Spike protein subunitive one since the nucleocapsid protein of SARS cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to an infection of SARS cov2 but rather to the transfection of tissues by the gene-based covid-19 vaccines the reason why they can safely say that this was not an infection from SARS cov2 is because there was no nucleocapsid proteins seen on the autopsy they go on importantly Spike protein could be only demonstrated in the areas with acute inflammatory reactions brain heart and small blood vessels and in particular the endothelial cells microglia and astrocytes this is strongly suggested that the spike protein may have played at least a contributing role to the development of the lesions and the course of the disease in the patient they go on based on the alteration pattern in the brain and heart it appear that the small blood vessels were especially affected in particularly the endothelium endothelial dysfunction is known to be highly involved in organ dysfunction during viral infections he does mention that this can happen in viral infections as it induces a pro-coagulant state microvascular leak and organ ischemia this is also the case for SARS cov2 infection so in other words this is looking like a SARS cov2 infection however he's not calling the SARS cov2 infection because there's no nucleocapsid proteins in the extra respiratory tissues they say here where a systemic exposure to the virus and a spike protein elicits a strong immunological reaction in which the endothelial cells play a crucial role leading to vascular dysfunction immunoth thrombosis and inflammation and those of you who know us at medcram we've talked extensively about this and how oxidative stress in the endothelial cells can lead to damage releasing on von Willebrand's fractor which causes these small micro clots in the circulation of the lungs and causing hypoxia that's probably what leads to happy hypoxics he goes on although there was no history of covid-19 for this patient immunochemistry for SARS cov2 antigens was performed Spike protein could indeed be demonstrated in the years of acute inflammation in the brain particularly within the capital endothelium and the small blood vessels of the heart remarkably however the nucleocapsid was uniformly absent during an infection with the virus both proteins should be expressed and detected together he says it doesn't give a reference for that interestingly but it makes logical Sense on the other hand the gene-based covid-19 vaccines encode only the spike protein and therefore the presence of Spike protein only but no nucleocapsid protein in the heart and brain on the current case can be attributed to vaccination rather to infection this agrees with the patient's history which includes three vaccine injections the first one was a DNA the last two were RNA and the third one just three weeks before his death but no positive laboratory clinical diagnosis of the infection doesn't sound like the patient actually had a covid-19 test which could be asymptomatic so the conclusion illusion was numerous cases of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis have been reported in connection with the gene-based covid-19 vaccines with many being considered causally related to vaccination however this is the first report to demonstrate the presence of the spike protein actually in these encephalitic lesions and to attribute it to vaccination rather than infection these findings corroborate the causative role of gene-based covid-19 vaccines and this diagnostic approach is relevant to potentially vaccine-induced damage to other organs as well he's making the point here that the absence of the nucleocapsid is the cinquequinone to speak the Latin that this is definitely vaccination contrast this with this paper this is a paper that was published in the annals of diagnostic pathology its original contribution notice here that this was available online even though it was published in October around the same time as the other paper the results of this paper were available since May of last year let's find out what this paper says they say here cardiac manifestations are common in severe coven 19. so these these are looking at covid-19 deaths these are deaths that are attributed to covid-19 and they're looking actually at 11 of these and 11 controls and what they're able to do is something called insight to hybridization which is a way of measuring RNA samples and they're also using exactly the same technique that they used in the first paper which is immunohistochemistry for viral proteins and what did they do they looked for ace2 expression which we're not going to get into because that's not really the purpose of this they did see that ace2 expression was 10 times greater than the heart tissues of cases and controls with obesity or type 2 diabetes I think that's really interesting but what they found is these are covid-19 cases that died and what they found starting right here is interesting however in each case abundant SARS Kobe 2 Spike protein was evidence but SARS cov2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein were rarely detected in situ in any covid-19 heart let me repeat that again here these are known to have covid-19 from source cov2 even in these cases in non-respiratory tissue whereas they found plenty of Spike protein they did not find nucleocapsid protein as well what they conclude though is that the viral Spike protein is endocytized by macrophages in the lung and are carried to the heart and the brain and other organs and that's the reason why you're seeing the spike protein and not the nucleocapsid so let's take a look at some of the data here here's what's called a western blot from proteins extracted either from the nasopharynx which is NP that's part of the respiratory where you'll see a lot of nucleocapsidin Spike with no evidence of SARS cov2 or a positive result so here's the nasopharynx it's negative and you can see here we don't see any proteins here's the nasopharynx with someone with a very high copy count of SARS cov2 and what you see here is you see this band and you see this band this blue band at the top is the spike protein and this Brown Band down here is the nucleocapsid protein notice that when you look at the nasal pharynx and you have low copy count you can see still the spike protein but this nasal frenchial sample of nucleocapsid protein is almost non-existent which means that even in respiratory tissue where there's a high copy count you might not pick up nucleocapsid protein even if you are infected with SARS cov2 all right let's move on to the nucleocapsid proteins specifically so here we have nucleocapsid protein and this is the band that you want to look at because that is the nucleocapsid protein these are covered lungs covered lung one covered lung two notice in normal lung we do not see that nucleocaps at protein by the way these are just reference lines let's take a look at these covid organs we have covid liver organ one there is no band if we look in the brain in this coveted patient no band covid cns-1 no band how about the spleen in covid no band of course the normal CNS there's no band either they said their nucleocaps of protein is only evident in the lung samples and nasopharynx that's respiratory that's where it divides and it's not found in any of the other organs tested what about Spike maybe it's just not there maybe the spike isn't there either maybe it just didn't go it was a mild infection no because most of the covid-19 heart samples showed a band that analyzed for viral spikes so where's the spike protein this is Spike this is Spike so in the lung we see spike in the heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this heart we see a light spike in this coveted heart too we see a light Spike pre-covet heart no Spike spike can go to extra respiratory organs but we have not seen an example here where the nucleocaps that goes to extra respiratory organs in SARS Kobe 2. they say here quote interestingly only the covid-19 lung and nasopharyngeal samples showed a signal for the nucleocapsid protein specifically 0 out of 11 cardiac cases were positive for the nucleocapsid protein whereas 7 out of 11 were positive for the viral Spike and the envelope proteins they did not show that data in this but that's what they showed now let's take a look at the immunohistochemical staining which is what they did in that first study and let's see what we see here we see lung do we see nucleocapsid absolutely we see nucleocapsid in the same way that we would normally see it but do we see heart Spike yes these little pink things are heart Spike well if we're seeing heart Spike we should also see heart nucleocapsid right because this is a viral infection but we see crickets here we see nothing there is no nucleocapsid in viral infections so what do they say they say the source of the endogenous Spike protein in severe covid-19 would likely be the extremely high copy viral load seen in the lungs of these patients they're saying here that in the lungs of patients this is where the virus is replicating so much that you're going to be able to see both Spike and nucleocapsid the virus in the lung induces a micro angiopathy that causes viral degeneration and is a logical source of viral Spike proteins entering the circulation this is exactly what we've been talking about and docking in organs with a high perivascular bed and ace2 population that would be Hearts preliminary data suggests that the viral Spike protein alone with the Matrix and envelope proteins are carried by macrophages in the circulation this could explain in many studies which have shown that the viral Spike protein per se or more accurately the S1 subunit the spike protein which has the RBD sequence for ace2 can demonstrate cytotoxic effects so you may never see the nucleocapsid going to distant organs that are non-respiratory because it's the spike that gets picked up by the macrophages and not the nucleocapsid so remember when we go back to that first study remember there was a control and here we saw a spike in the respiratory secretions and here we saw nucleocapsid in the respiratory secretions but we never saw this for non-respiratory secretions remember that the author of the first study says since the nucleocapsid protein of stars cov2 was consistently absent it must be assumed that the presence of Spike protein in affected tissues was not due to infection I'm not sure if that is a logical assumption anymore based on the data that we have now and that was actually available at the time of publication even back as far as May of 2022 it seems very likely in fact that you're not going to pick up the presence of nucleocapsid proteins in non-respiratory organs of the body in patients who are infected with SARS cov2 let's go back to our case study again I would be very surprised if there wasn't a single case out there or multiple cases even where there has been significant injury or even death from an intervention right I see this all the time in my Intensive Care Unit I have patients that come in with head bleeds because they're on anticoagulation and clearly as a result of the anticoagulation that they're on but the Hope was is that that anticoagulation would prevent a stroke and indeed we know that every year thousands and thousands of Strokes are prevented because people are put on blood thinners but we also get maybe a few tens 20s 30s of people who have head bleeds and we look at that risk benefit and so I think it's important to continue to look for these things but we also have to look at the data and make the analysis here to see whether or not in fact this is going on and this is what I've done looking at data and actually telling you things that could falsify my interpretation conclusions in this situation the patient had a mRNA vaccine dose 3 and it was two weeks later that the patient collapsed and then one week later the patient died so three weeks after this basically this mRNA Pfizer vaccine was given so the question is if this is actually happening we should see a signal after people have been vaccined so I go again to the graph of vaccination versus excess deaths here up on the top we see daily SARS cov2 infections during the beginning of the pandemic we have the first wave this is a scale going to 1 million you can see here the first wave was about 300 000 and this Delta wave here again was probably maybe 250 000. this was up here almost a million we didn't catch all of these people some of them weren't tested but we tested as many as we could and we can kind of get relative looks at these things down here we have excess mortality so this is anybody who died and the thing I like about excess mortality not none coveted mortality it doesn't matter what's put on the death certificate whatever's on the death certificate is on the death certificate all you need is a death certificate and a date and it goes in here so it doesn't matter if the patient is misdiagnosed as having covet or not having coveted or they died of encephalitis and they didn't think it was from covet it's all going in here it's all being captured notice here that the same pattern of SARS cov2 matches the same pattern here of this excess wave happening exactly at the time that it should happen maybe two to three weeks after it we have the same thing here with the Delta wave and we see again here because that Delta wave was just so virulent we see it exactly popping up two weeks later because it takes about two weeks for people to die once they get infected from Stars Kobe 2. the Omicron wave once again so we see here that the Peaks completely line up superimposed on top of that and reversed for ease of looking at here is the number of vaccinations whereas we had about 300 000 Stars Kobe 2 cases here in a single day we vaccinated three and a half million people over 10 times the number of people got a spike protein from the vaccine then the people that got a spike protein from the first wave of SARS Kobe 2. and so if this is what we're seeing as a result of excess deaths from the first wave we should see something approximately three weeks later down approximately right here as a result of vaccination with an mRNA vaccine I'm not saying that it doesn't happen as I said I would be very surprised if there was absolutely no risk associated with a intervention there's risk associated with every intervention but what I am saying is that whatever the magnitude of that risk is has to fit underneath this curve at that point if we're talking about an immediate effect from SARS cov2 vaccinations If This Were happening I would have expected depending on the magnitude I would have expected something to look like this you know be a little bit delayed or I would expect it's something to look like this or if it was less in magnitude or even less in magnitude something that would look like that when this is the number of I have it upside down here right so that's the peak this here is the peak of all vaccinations in the United States we vaccinated in one day on this day three and a half million people doesn't mean that there's not long-term effects but I'm not seeing an acute Association here at least on this curve going back to the publication that I was involved with we have to realize that there is always going to be side effects and we can see that here that as time goes on regardless of if you're on the anticoagulation or not on the anticoagulation there are going to be people who have major bleeding events but the key to understanding whether or not and how you can prevent those is not to compare somebody who would never have an event with someone who did have an event you have to compare someone who did have an event with someone who didn't get the intervention and that's where it's important to be able to look at things epidemiologically and with studies and with data the other thing that this shows is that sometimes things may seem logical but this is the reason we press for evidence-based medicine even though something may seem logical or it may seem like it makes sense like in this case it would seem logical that if you see the spike protein without the nucleocapsid that it would make sense that since the vaccine only makes the spike protein without the nucleocapsid this would implement Kate the vaccine however there could be other factors that are preventing that nucleocapsid protein from getting out of the respiratory tissue and into non-respiratory tissue organs the second paper highlights that even though this thing made sense it may not be the case and without my condolences to all of these people that had perished from one reason or another that were used in these studies and with the families as well I know all too well the impacts here we talk about statistics and numbers but each one of these people have families loved ones and again my condolences I am a Frontline doctor that works in the Intensive Care Unit so I understand the actual reality of all of these issues and with that this concludes,Encephalitis After COVID-19 Vaccine Administration_

12,"I've gathered a lot of questions from our viewers about immunity and vaccines including the basic question, how safe are mRNA vaccines? But before we get to those questions, can you briefly explain your most recent research about SARS-CoV-2 Professor Crotty: Sure, the most recent was to ask, essentially, do people have immune memory to this virus or not? And what does that memory look like? An immune memory really is a lot like brain memory; it's you've seen something before and your immune system has figured out how to recognize it and remember it. It's really one of three major parts that you've got: antibodies, then you've got helper T cells, and you've got killer T cells. And the simple way to think about those is antibodies are really good at stopping a virus outside of cells, but once a virus has infected the cells, then you really need T cells. T cells are specialized for dealing with infected cells and antibodies get made by B cells, and so in terms of memory, you've really got memory B cells that can make the antibodies. You've got the antibodies that are actually circulating in your blood and then you've got these two kinds of T cells that can either kill cells or have other jobs, and so what we did was to ask in people who had had COVID-19, do they have these four kinds of memory and some sub flavors of those? How much of that, and how long did it last? And the quick answer was essentially like 95 percent of people at six to eight months post-infection really had a robust amount of immune memory based on these measurements we did, and this is the largest study of immune memory ever in people to actually measure all of these different parts of immune memory. So it was a lot of work, but the results were pretty interesting that people's immune system do tend to be remembering this virus pretty well. So that was our recent study. Kyle: SARS-CoV-2 is made up of, what is it, 25 or 28 major proteins? Professor Crotty: Correct Kyle: The scientists at Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna have isolated the messenger RNA for just the spike protein. Is that correct? Is this spike protein made up of one protein or of multiple proteins? Professor Crotty: It's one protein, so it's a it's a trimer, so it ends up being three copies of the same protein, so it's all encoded by one RNA. It's the same sequence just three folded together three times. Kyle: Got it. Why did both companies choose to use spike protein for their target for this vaccine? Professor Crotty: Right, so there are about 29 licensed human vaccines, depending on how you count, and almost all of them work on the basis of protective antibody responses, and so when you're trying to move fast with with vaccine development, the most obvious target is to try and make antibodies against the protein that's on the surface of the virus, because antibodies work by binding to the surface of a virus and essentially covering the virus and keeping the virus from doing anything. That's really the simple way to think about antibodies working, and so for previous coronaviruses, it was known that there are a couple of different proteins on the surface of the virus, but it's really the spike protein that's the major one and probably the most important antibody target, and sure enough, in the months subsequent to those decisions, lots of data have accumulated that have said, essentially, all of the neutralizing antibodies, the important antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, are against the spike protein. So the spike protein is the best target to focus on for antibodies, and when I talk to you about, you know there really being three parts of the immune system, one of the concerns has been that sometimes antibodies aren't that great at stopping all viruses, and then you really need the T cells to kick in, and the T cells don't necessarily recognize spike. They might recognize some of those other 25 proteins, and so that was actually our first major scientific study on COVID-19 was to ask infected people: do people make T cells that recognize spike also or only other proteins? And what we found was that it infected people, actually people make a lot of T cell responses to spike also, and so that was a really that was a good sign supporting the vaccine development at all that. If you are, some viruses you have to choose more than one protein. For this virus, it looks like, ""yeah just choosing one protein is a reasonable way to try and get antibody responses and T cell responses."" Kyle: Along those lines, f this virus mutated, well we know it's mutating all the time, but if there was a mutation, I guess, is it possible that there's a mutation where this virus could infect and can cause harm without the spike protein? Professor Crotty: No, not without the spike protein. The question's really about whether you know if this is the spike protein. Can it mutate the spike protein so it looks a little bit different and now antibodies are recognizing the three-dimensional structure they're physically binding? It's sort of like if, well I mean, it's like anything. It's like ,you know, it's like my mouse, right? And it's like, well, maybe the antibodies are really recognizing this little knobby wheel, and if they're just recognizing that and the virus mutates that, well now you're in trouble, because you're not seeing the other parts of it, and so that's something people have been spending a lot of attention to. Of where exactly are those virus mutations? And then, where are the antibody responses people are making? And viruses behave different ways, so flu is a really big problem in that way, where flu is clearly able to mutate, but lots of other viruses aren't. So like measles, there's been a measles vaccine for, what, 70 years now? And the virus has never managed to mutate away from that. And same thing with polio and hepatitis B, and so far it looks like 95 percent of people still had antibodies that neutralize that virus very well, and that's probably because every single person is making multiple different antibodies, so even if the virus has one mutation, that doesn't escape, because it's only escaping one little part of the immune response. Kyle Allred: The scientists have been able to isolate this one strand of mRNA that just codes for the spike protein, and then they've packaged it into what are called lipid nanoparticles, is that correct? Professor Crotty: Yes, that's correct. Kyle: Basically just little fat droplets, if you will, right? Very small uh microscopic fat droplets. Professor Crotty: Super tiny butter droplets. Yep, that's basically what you're talking about. Kyle: So, why do they package it that way and also how do they package that way? They have this mRNA, how do they get it into the lipid nanoparticle? Professor Crotty: Yeah, so um and so I think for that we also need to deal with just what is RNA, and why is an RNA vaccine a reasonable approach? So RNA is a really common molecule in your body; essentially all living things use RNA as messages, and those messages encode within a cell. At any one of your cells, at any given time, you've got like 5,000 different RNAs and those RNAs are each encoding different messages that tell the cells to do different things, make different proteins, and RNAs are made to be transient, so they're really a lot like, it's like 5,000 Post-It notes, and they'll be around for minutes or hours, and then they get shredded up, and they're gone, they're temporary, and so an RNA vaccine is same thing, it's a temporary message, but it has to get into the cell, and so if it's in the cell, the cell will now read that message and do what the message says, which helps then instruct the immune system. And then the message goes away okay. So RNA are these temporary messages, or like snapchat messages was the other analogy that I've used. There's a message and then it it expires. Technologically one of the big challenges there is that RNA is temporary, it gets shredded up really easily -- again like just shredding up a Post-It note -- and so you got to get it into the cells without it all getting shredded up. So if you just inject RNA from a syringe into somebody's skin, it doesn't get into the cells. So the trick that people figured out over the past 10 years was, ""oh you can put it in these little butter droplets, and those little droplets will basically fuse with the cells and release the RNA into the cell."" So now you've got, the message has now made it into the cell where it needs to be read, and then it can be shredded up afterwards. So it's just, it's a delivery system to get them all get the RNA into the cells. Kyle: The lipid nanoparticle that's taken this mRNA vaccine, what cells in our body does it actually go into? Is it just muscle cells in our arm where we get the injection? Professor Crotty: Yeah, it's a good question. So it definitely goes into muscle cells, and I think, and scientists are still learning which cells are the important cells, basically. Most of the cells that are getting the RNA are the muscle cells, and it's possible that specialized cells of the immune system that aren't very common, but they may get the RNA, and those may be the more important for starting the immune response, but yeah most of the RNA is going into the muscle cells and I'm sure the protein expression there matters. It's just, that might not be the only cell type that matters. Kyle: A question a lot of people have had is, once that mRNA gets into our cells and codes for that spike protein, does it just code, does each strand of mRNA just code for one spike protein? And then does the Post-It note, or the mRNA get destroyed or dissolve, or does it code for multiple proteins and last for maybe an hour or a day? Like how long does the mRNA from this vaccine actually last in our cells, approximately? Professor Crotty: Yeah, it's a good question. So the goal, so the RNA gets read multiple times, so it'll just keep -- it gets read over and over and over again, so that you make a lot of the spike protein, which will then get expressed on the surface of the cell to stimulate the immune system. And I'd say average RNAs in your cell will last some time, generally minutes to hours, but some of them will last a day or more, and these, the RNA vaccines are engineered to be stable, and so um the information I've seen is that they'll last a couple of days. Kyle: So we have the mRNA inside of a lipid nanoparticle, what else goes in in the vaccine obviously it's got to be some type of saline solution or something? Professor Crotty: Right, that's it. It's basically, um, it's basically just delivered in some, essentially, some, yeah, salt water set to match the the saltiness of your own body. So that it's essentially as ""natural"" as possible. Kyle: It seems like a question that a lot of people have with vaccines in general is, ""okay, well what else do they put in them?"" And from my understanding with this Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, they came out and said, ""we didn't put any adjuvants or preservatives in this particular vaccine."" Why are adjuvants used sometimes in vaccines? Professor Crotty: Yeah, that's a great question. So essentially, usually adjuvants are are used, and it goes back to what I said about immune memory at the beginning, you know your immune system, some remembers some things really well and remembers other things really poorly, and there are complexities there, but the rule of thumb is that the bigger the threat, then the bigger the memory. It's a lot like, you know, you might not be able to remember what socks you put on two days ago, but if you're almost in a car accident at some particular intersection, you're going to remember that intersection for a very long time, right? Because it was a memorable event, and so vaccines have to deal with the same thing: that the immune system is good at ignoring things that aren't very threatening, and so adjuvants are a way of providing the immune system a stimulation that says, ""hey, this thing that you're about to see, this is a potential threat, and you should make a substantial immune response to it and remember it,"" and so that's if you just inject a protein by itself. That protein's inert; it's non-threatening; it's not replicating; it's not going to do anything to you. And so the adjuvant is the immune stimulus to get you going. An RNA vaccine essentially ends up encoding its own stimulation, so it accomplishes that on its own. Kyle: The lipid nanoparticle has done its job. It's brought the mRNA into the cell, and now it's the ribosome's job to actually code, or basically essentially build a protein out of that structure? Professor Crotty: Right, so what your immune system ends up needing to see in the end are proteins, because that's what the virus itself is made out of, proteins. The spike proteins are on the surface of the virus, and it's those proteins that an antibody or T cells  would recognize and your cells are making proteins all the time, as instructed by RNA messages. So now instead they're going to make these viral spike proteins, and that's what the immune system will start recognizing, and that does get triggered by just the normal protein synthesis machinery in the cells, which is, um yeah, which are the ribosomes and the amino acids already in your cells. Kyle: Why not just skip a step and use a vaccine that uses the spike protein itself? Why go through this extra step of the of the RNA? Professor Crotty: Right, that's a really good question, so and one of the classic ways to make a vaccine is to have the vaccine be the protein, be the viral spike protein or be a viral nanoparticle. And there are vaccines that work fantastically well that way, and some of the original vaccines going back to the early 20th century are that way; that's the tetanus vaccine and diphtheria vaccine, which are incredibly successful. And in fact, some of the COVID-19 vaccines currently being worked on are protein vaccines, and there's a reasonable chance those will succeed as vaccines. A downside to protein vaccines is that you have to manufacture the protein, and the manufacturing process for any given protein is its own unique manufacturing problem, and so in terms of just a physical production problem, you've got to solve that production problem. And since that's unique, the FDA has to basically review every step of it and agree that everything is fine about that. And viral proteins tend to be kind of unusual proteins; they're not super simple to manufacture, so it can take some time and energy to figure out how to solve that, basically, manufacturing problem, that biochemistry protein synthesis problem. The RNA vaccines bypass that problem, because the manufacturing process is always the same. The RNA encodes a different sequence, but molecularly, it's the same manufacturing process, and so FDA approval and what not is all really fast, because it just it looks the same from a manufacturing standpoint. So that's why the RNA vaccines have gone through phase one, phase two, phase three trial so fast and gotten FDA approval so quick is because they were they were very fast to manufacture and very fast to approve, because it's, largely, once they solve the problem once, it's plug and play. Kyle: So along those lines, do you think this is really the future of vaccine development, using this type of technology? Professor Crotty: I mean, the results are incredibly encouraging, right? I mean this is the first time ever in human history there's been a vaccine developed within a calendar year, and not only that, now it's actually been three, right? There have been three successful phase three clinical trials within a single calendar year. That's never happened for anything. So those are phenomenal successes in the RNA vaccine showing 95 efficacy, right? And fantastic efficacy in the elderly and fantastic efficacy against severe disease. I mean, those are huge wins and RNA vaccines are definitely going to be successful solutions again in the future. I think they're likely to still be part of the vaccine toolbox. I don't think they'll solve every problem. There are some things that I think they're good at, and there are other things that other vaccine technologies may be better at. But in terms of speed, I mean, nothing can match this. You know, I mean vaccine development, classically, is frequently a 20-year process, right? Or, you know, let's say a 10-year process, and instead you're talking about a 10-month process. You know, it's not only a 10-month process, but a 10-month process that really involved a huge amount of safety data on all, right? I mean, you know, 70,000 doses being given and tested to validate both the efficacy and the safety that clearly RNA vaccines have a very promising future. Kyle: From my understanding, mRNA does its work just in the cytoplasm of our cells. Is that correct? Professor Crotty: That's correct. So yeah, I've gotten lots of questions about, ""well wait, isn't this genetic engineering? I don't want to be genetically engineered."" I'm like, well, fair enough, I don't want to be genetically engineered either, but this is RNA; it's just messages. They're transient, temporary, they don't become part of your body. It's just not the same thing as DNA. Kyle: Now what about, speaking of DNA, the AstraZeneca vaccine candidate that utilizes DNA? Professor Crotty: Yeah, so both the AstraZeneca approach and the Johnson & Johnson approach use a viral vector, and it is a viral vector that contains DAN, but really it's about the virus. So they're using a different virus and adenovirus as a delivery system into your cells, essentially, you know, sort of like giving you one viral infection to teach your immune system how to fight another viral infection. That's also transient DNA that doesn't become part of your DNA, That's just the virus's DNA, and those viral vectors they've been ""gutted,"" so that they can't become another adenovirus. It's like taking a car and taking out the engine, you know, and even and taking out the seats. It still looks like a car from the outside and you can put some new stuff in it, and you're sort of showing that to the immune system to teach you what something looks like, but it's not going to go drive off on its own or anything. Kyle: Got it. Okay so going back to our kind of step-by-step process, we have the mRNA. The ribosome then codes for a spike protein. Does that spike protein then get released from our our cells? Does it get expressed on the surface of our cells or both? Professor Crotty: Both. Predominantly, it's getting expressed on the surface of the cells, and that's just um, that's where, well, that's a good way for it to be shown to the immune system, basically. Kyle: So it gets shown to the immune system and then what happens? Professor Crotty: so, a thousand different things. An immune response is a really complicated, orchestrated dance but, essentially, you have in your body right now parts of your adaptive immune system that can potentially recognize any possible virus that would ever exist. But to do that, you have billions of cells that are all really rare, so it's basically, there's like one in a million cells somewhere that could actually make the antibodies that would recognize the virus that would stop it. And same thing with the T cells, so what has to happen is those very rare cells have to be exposed to this new protein, and then since those cells are so rare, they're not very useful when they're, you know, one in a million, one in a billion cells in your body. So those cells have to grow and divide and multiply until there are millions of them, and that takes time. And that's one of the big goals of a vaccine is to, really, the whole point of a vaccine is to show your immune system what the virus looks like before you're infected, so that your immune system can go through that learning process and that growth process on its own, on your immune system's own time, and get you to a point where now, okay, you've got the antibodies, and you've got the T cells, and you're going to have that immune memory all before you ever get exposed to the virus. So normally when you get exposed to the virus, the virus gets the head start. Okay and then your immune system is playing catch-up; your immune system has these rare cells that can potentially protect you, but they're rare, and they have to grow from one cell into a million cells, and usually that takes a week, and you get sick for that week in the meantime. Kyle: So you talked about this cascade of immune system effects and response to either a vaccine or a natural infection with a vaccine. What symptoms would you expect when the immune system is really ramping up and responding? Professor Crotty: Yeah, it's another good question, and and I get it a lot. Yeah, I definitely tell people, you know, these vaccines are safe; that doesn't mean they're not gonna make it not feel so great for a day or two or have a little bit of a fever, and that can be a really positive thing, because essentially this goes back to your immune system is really designed to remember things that were something of a threat, you know, and so it's, uh, you really do kind of have to earn your immunity some, a lot like going to the gym and working out. You know, if you get really sore, that can really be a positive sign. Same kind of thing for a vaccine; if you've got some swelling, if you've got some redness, if you got a little bit of a fever, those are basically all straightforward signs that your immune system is working, is doing its job of recognizing that vaccine and building the tools and weapons to fight the virus if they see it, and usually for most vaccines, that can go on for, you know, one day, two days, three days, and that's been what people have been seeing with these RNA vaccines as well. Most people get a bit of redness and a bit of soreness, and some people get a real fever for a day, and that's honestly just a positive sign that your immune system is fighting it. Kyle: So, I mean, ""side effect"" is almost the wrong terminology for that. I mean, it's really kind of an expected immunogenic response. Professor Crotty: Exactly, and that's why it's important to recognize that safety is really important for vaccines, because vaccines are given to healthy people, and that's always been a key feature of vaccines is paying a lot of attention to safety, but that's different than, yeah, what we're talking about here of getting sore or feeling a bit tired. Those can be sort of, essentially, ""on target"" effects, signs that you're immune, signs that the vaccine is really working. Kyle: The guidance from the FDA and the CDC with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is that even people who have had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection should get the vaccine. I think a lot of people were initially confused by this. Why do you think they made that recommendation? Professor Crotty:  Yeah, it's a good question, and it's because we don't, like as of today and certainly as of a couple weeks ago, we don't have a good grasp of how long does protective immunity last  after you've had COVID-19? And we also don't know how long it lasts after the vaccines. But, so far that the vaccines are looking good. In our data, when we looked at immune memory in people, right, we were seeing something like 95 percent of people had what we consider immune memory. That looks good, but that still doesn't prove that those people are going to have protective immunity. Really, you have to have bigger, longer studies to wait and see, you know. How long are people protected? And so, yeah, I think the vaccine recommendation is the right one. If we knew for sure that  catching COVID-19 really did give you protective immunity for a long time, then I think the vaccine recommendation would be ""no, don't bother."" But as it stands right now, we don't know that, and so it makes sense to still recommend getting the vaccine. Kyle: And is it possible that the vaccine can actually give longer immunity than a natural infection? Professor Crotty: It's possible. There are definitely vaccines that do that. So the papillomavirus vaccine is a fantastic example of a vaccine where the vaccine works way better than natural infection at generating protective immunity and long lasting immunity. The opposite also occurs. I mean, the normal flu vaccine really gives pretty short-lived immunity, but if you actually catch the flu, your immunity to that flu is really quite long-lasting. So it can go both ways, and since RNA vaccines are new, we don't have a historical reference point for comparison. So far the data with the RNA vaccines has been fantastic, and really the big unanswered question with them at this point is durability. How long are they going to last? And right now, we don't know how long durability is going to last for the vaccine compared to having had the infection. Kyle: The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccines are very similar. Why does the Pfizer vaccine need to be stored at negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit, when the Moderna vaccine just needs regular refrigeration? Professor Crotty: It's pretty cold, right? Well, I think the Moderna, one requires the very cold for long-term storage but for a shorter term, it can do better. And in fact, there are other RNA vaccine formulations that have been published later in 2020 that could actually do room temperature storage. It comes down to the nature, the precise nature, of those lipid nanoparticles, and how stable they are. Kyle: I'm gonna put you on the spot here, Professor Crotty. If you had a family member or a close friend say to you, ""You know, professor, you've studied vaccines in immunity your entire career. This vaccine looks promising, but it, you know as you mentioned, the timeline has been so much shorter than what we're used to with vaccines and it's using a new technology, this rna technology. Should I be nervous about this?"" What would you say? Professor Crotty: Yeah, great question. And the answer is no, don't be nervous. Definitely get vaccinated. If you can get vaccinated, I mean obviously for one right now, the COVID-19 threat in the population is horrible, right? I mean, we've crossed thresholds of like 3,000 deaths a day in the country. I mean, those are, uh, it's a really bad situation, and on the flip side, these vaccines are, you know, 95 percent effective. That, in two totally independent trials of huge numbers of people, that data is really strong. These vaccines definitely work, and yeah I certainly get questions about safety, which are reasonable questions to ask, again, because you said, because of the speed. And so there are two parts of it: one is you would be really hard-pressed to find any medicine that has had this much safety data already by the time it becomes publicly available. Again, 70,000 people have already gotten the vaccine and been tracked for safety. That's a huge amount of safety data, way more than most medicines get when they come to market. So, I mean, those are -- and the reason for accumulating all that was actually because of speed. That's actually to find results quick enough, they had to have a huge number of people involved in the study, and so as a result, they got a ton of safety data, and they've also got safety data going, you know, for essentially six months from the earlier clinical trials that got started in the summer. Really the best way to think about the speed of development is one: this is a technology that could move very fast through manufacturing and that's really where a lot of the speed came from was manufacturing. The safety parts of it is the same amount of time as it basically always takes. And the other thing that's been fast about it has been problems that money could solve. So normally for developing a vaccine, somebody goes through a phase one trial and then waits and then goes through a phase trial and waits and then goes to a phase three. They don't invest a huge amount of money up front, because there's a good chance that they would lose that money, and instead in this situation, right, going back to March, companies governments, and non-government organizations were all saying, ""okay, invest the billion dollars up front, you know, and sure, we may lose that money, but if it works we'll have a vaccine, you know, a year faster than we otherwise would, because we're just paying for the manufacturing to get going up front."" That's just the problem money can solve. You could just be losing that money in the end, but you're not taking any shortcuts. You're just starting the process a lot earlier than you would otherwise and, sure enough, things worked out incredibly well, right, and these vaccines are actually working, and so now there are already vaccine doses being delivered instead of the companies now starting to manufacture them and then being delivered, you know, six months or more later. Kyle: And as you mentioned, there's good data and there's a lot of data about safety in the short term. What about long-term potential side effects? I know that's another concern. Professor Crotty: Yeah, that's a good question, and that was one of the main ones that the FDA wanted to consider as well, and so basically they did a review of vaccine literature and said ,""yeah in the past for all these other vaccines, any important vaccine safety signature was clear within two months,"" and so that's why the FDA specifically demanded that there be two full months of safety data on these large trials and that's what's being reviewed by the FDA, and they've, yeah, they've looked fine. Kyle: So in other words, if, based on the extensive history we have with vaccines, if you don't see a safety concern in the first two months of use of the vaccine, it's unlikely to see long-term side effects down the road? Professor Crotty: Right, yeah, that's exactly right. Kyle: Well, Professor Crotty, thanks so much for joining us today. We really appreciate it, and, briefly, any next projects that you and your team there at the lab are focusing on? Professor Crotty: Yeah, so, I mean, here at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, we're one of the best places in the world studying the immune system, and we can actually look at all these different immune responses to COVID-19 at the same time, which most places can't. So we're continuing to examine that both to try and understand acute disease, you know why people end up in the hospital, as well as immune memory to this virus, and it's, uh yeah, it's a lot of work, but it's important. So those are the problems we keep trying to solve. Kyle: Well, thanks so much for your time and all your research and work. Really appreciate it. Professor Crotty: Yeah, thanks, Kyle.

14,many countries have been relying on the astrazeneca vaccine to get them out of the coronavirus pandemic crisis but there have been problems from supply to side effects now european regulators say the vaccine can in rare cases cause blood clots the uk is to offer alternative jobs to young people who appear to be at more risk but both the uk and eu say they are still confident in the astrozenica vaccine's effectiveness and safety there have been fewer than 80 cases reported in the uk despite more than 20 million being given out but even so that's caused a reaction the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the astrazeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine based on the current available evidence specific risk factors such as age gender or previous medical history of of clotting disorders have not been able to be confirmed as the rarest events are seen in all ages and in men and women the first possible connection between the astrozenica vaccine and blood clotting was made in late february since then speculation research and reactions have been mixed many medical bodies carried out investigations but failed to come up with the link between the jab and clotting even emma cook who you had just heard before said the ema didn't think the two were related but more than a dozen countries temporarily suspended use of the vaccine austria first then france spain germany in europe and then indonesia thailand and democratic republic of congo now with the latest moves many countries are introducing age limits for the drug australia the philippines and the handful of eu countries have all halted astrazeneca jabs for people under a certain age oxford university which was behind the creation of the vaccine continues to stand by its work in a statement its professor of pediatric infection and immunity said safety has been our priority throughout the development of the vaccine at university of oxford in 2020 and we are reassured to see that safety monitoring continues under the close scrutiny of regulators and public health authorities as a vaccine is rolled out around the world the identification of rare cases of blood clots which might be associated with a vaccine shows that the safety system works and has also allowed the uk and the eu's regulators to conclude that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh the risks putting in measures to help mitigate any possible risk let's bring in our guests in cambridge chris smith is consultant virologist at cambridge university and postcards host of the naked scientists in london oxana paisak is lead on the outbreak of infectious diseases for the university college london's global citizenship program in barcelona jeffrey lazarus head of the health systems research group at the barcelona institute for global health welcome to the program chris the finding by the european medicine agency now about the link between the astrazeneca and the blood clots this should be really bad news for a company that has been battered by a series of setbacks i think the chief executive officer pascal sorio has said he kind of regrets going down the path of offering a vaccine which makes no profit for astrazeneca which is the decision that they took they should be available at cost it was a wonderful gesture it seems to be somewhat thrown back in their face yes it's tricky and and obviously one is very concerned at the moment with the concept of vaccine hesitancy one of the crucial things about getting this over the line and getting the pandemic under control is that we have the support and trust of the general public and that translating into high uptake of vaccines which will suppress the spread of the virus and it will translate what would have otherwise been lethal infections into non-lethal infections with this kind of image problem that the vaccine is currently laboring under that could be a problem going forward oksana what do you think will be the immediate implications of the latest finding by the email well the you know still have said that the benefits outweigh the risks and actually they have not defined any age-based recommendations uh but countries are choosing to do so restricting uh to above uh 55 in brussels and um over 16 other countries as well so we do see that there is a variation here in terms of the interpretation of what the european medicines agency has concluded as well as the uk body the mhra what we see as well is that we consider the overall benefits of the vaccine not just in terms of focusing on mortality rate but younger people can also be affected by things like long covet and there was a recent study in the landsat which showed that one in three people actually went on within six months to receive either a neurological or psychological diagnosis and so we really do need to ensure that this vaccine rollout continues to avoid greater burden on the health care system jeffrey how do you explain the different interpretations of both the email she says there is a link and the uk uk who say that there needs to be more investigation before establishing facts well it's difficult to explain you know how the how the bodies come up with different findings but as mentioned the european medicines agency has for the second time said that this is a safe vaccine with very rare side effects and it's common to have side effects with any vaccine or any medicine so it's completely safe to take it now that different european countries have defined different age groups is is their decision the important thing is that the astrazeneca vaccine gets used and if the europeans aren't going to use all the doses available to them then that's more doses for the rest of the world chris is it political in a way or another that the uk regulators are saying first of all as far as the causal relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of the blood clots coming together with a low platelets which are the main reason why we're seeing those fatalities is considered possible plausible however it has to be confirmed and for it to be confirmed this could take a body of work and research and data a good way of thinking about this is to look at the timeline over the life course and the risk profile so a person who's in their eighties may have say a ten percent or higher chance of succumbing to severe or lethal infection with coronavirus whereas someone who's 18 rather than 80 may have a one in a million chance of having a severe outcome if they catch coronavirus now if we map onto that the vaccine the vaccine has a side effect or complication rate potentially of about one in a million that's roughly the rate at which we're seeing these blood clots that might or might not be associated but let's assume they are one in a million so if we vaccinated a million people we might therefore expect to have one person with the complications now if those are all 80 year olds for one person with the complications we've saved 10 or 100 000 lives from coronavirus but if you contrast that with an 18 year old we've caused one person to have complications and we've prevented one person from having complications so that ratio of the risks versus the benefit is quite different when considered across the range of ages and it's that that has provoked the regulators to say we don't think there's a serious issue here and the fact that they've said if you've already had one dose of it carry on and have a second dose even if you are in the 20 to 29 year age group but because we do have alternatives and until we get the data we don't want to hold up the vaccination process because vaccines really do matter and they do save lives therefore let's offer the people who might be at a risk a different vaccine while we simultaneously continue for those other people for whom that risk benefit analysis is absolutely clear it's a safe very effective and life-saving vaccine but this is the problem uh oksana the the the finding of ema itself is going definitely to create some problem among among the people who are definitely going to be more skeptical now and this is going to create huge problems for astrazeneca which was hoping that it's vaccine widely touted as affordable easy to administer likely to compete with pfizer and modena that image itself is shattered in a way or another well i think the flip-flopping certainly hasn't helped originally we did see that the um older groups were not vaccinated uh due to the fact that there was the idea or the feeling there wasn't enough data on this and then that's now been reversed in the other direction so i do think that what we the survey so far do show that there is a dip in confidence um what's also interesting is that due to the different strategies in procurement and rollout the uk had at first identified less cases because we focused on vaccinating our um older population first so uh whereas on the continent we saw that there were certain age groups that were the elderly originally were left off and uh people who were in front line positions and either in hospitals care workers schools tended to be female so also some of the patterns that we're looking at now may just be result of who the vaccine was given to you rather than something more significant than that however there's let's not forget there's some countries in the world who have very little or no vaccines at all at this stage so i do think that uh certainly this is something that can be overcome it is damaging uh but we know that it the real and known dangers of covet far outweigh uh any potential adverse effects related to this vaccine and it fits a typical profile as well jeffrey many countries are stepping in just right after the findings were released of the ema saying that it's about time to start uh looking for options particularly for the people under 30. it's very easy said in practice this means that you have to rethink your whole procedures your whole strategy think about alternatives buy new medicine which is going to be extremely difficult particularly in the eu so if you're referring to to changing the vaccine strategy I'm not sure it's really that complicated it just means you're using your pfizer moderna or your johnson johnson vaccine for for those younger age groups rather than astrazeneca and you know like in spain whereI am now they've limited astrazeneca used to those aged 60 to 64. so they'll use up the vaccines they have hopefully they'll finish the second doses for those who have only received one dose and then that will be more vaccines and for the rest of the world what i'm hoping is that we can turn this around and say given that the european medicines agency has said it's safe we can use this to accelerate vaccination programs in other parts of the world which is extremely important in order to avoid um variants of concern because as those variants flourish we risk that some of them may become resistant to vaccines chris when you have the eu purchasing 400 million doses of uh astrazeneca the americans 300 million in the past trying to be uh ready for the eventuality of starting the fast track uh uh vaccination campaign what what would be the reaction um do you think among the decision makers now against the backdrop of the uh the findings of the email well i hope they'll look at the statistics and the statistics paint a very encouraging picture we're talking here about chance events occurring down at the level of less than one in a million to one in half a million that's really really low and when you put this up against the fact that the complication we're talking about affects about five people in a million per year just by chance anyway and if people take the oral contraceptive pill it increases their likelihood of this happening to them by maybe eight-fold and no one bats an eyelid about that sort of thing i think that probably most of the people making decisions around this will be saying well actually statistically we're on a very sure footing here because what we absolutely know is this is a very effective vaccine and the data we're seeing coming through now show in some cases 90 plus protection in the most vulnerable groups and it's also very very cheap it's one of the cheapest vaccines on the market and actually has one of the longest track records because the construct that's being used to make this vaccine has been used for more than a decade and and in the fight in west africa against ebola that construct went into thousands and thousands of people so we've also got long-term follow-up so there are many reasons to be reassured by these findings not least that they're being investigated properly oxana when you have people who have been from day one skeptical about this whole idea about getting vaccinated against kovid 19 as the safest way and you get this whole story about astrazeneca and the and the and the on the link between the vaccination and the blood clots do you have any concerns that this could unfortunately push some people to start comparing between vaccines and say you know what we think that one could be more efficient safer than the other one well i think that there we have to distinguish between people who are uh anti-vaxxers who even before the the pandemic would um be concerned or refuse vaccines and those who have some really legitimate questions uh based on on the headlines that they're seeing in the media and i think chris really broke it down in an understandable way that you know there's just a one in a million chance of this occurring which is about the same as getting murdered or being hit by a car uh in the next month or so so if we think about it that way it's it definitely i think eases the the concerns that people have i think what's crucial though is that the public's questions on the vaccines on the data that there is transparency that scientists and the governments do address their public regularly so that that confidence that past can be rebuilt and regained so i don't think that um it is uh for this middle ground group who who just want to understand uh what it is that the real risk is i think that that's something that healthcare professionals pharmacists doctors can have those conversations and and change people's minds that any vaccine at this stage uh is going to protect themselves and their loved ones because we see that there's also great data about limiting transmission it's not just about yourself it's also about the people around you jeffrey this looks like a a mammoth task ahead for astrazeneca particularly when it comes to the american market the fda is yet to authorize the emergency use and we're starting to hear reports from american officials saying that we might not use the astrazeneca at all by the end of the day that's right and if they don't then they will use pfizer moderna and johnson and johnson and like i said earlier that means more doses of astrazeneca for the rest of the world right now the vaccine is desperately needed across latin america in parts of africa where they have very very low numbers vaccinated so if it means the astrazeneca vaccine is is more available then that's where that's where it should be distributed through the kovacs facility or through direct purchase so i'm not so worried about um europe and the us right now with regards to the astrazeneca vaccine i think people should get their second dose um and then we have other options it's the countries that don't have those other options because they don't have the cold chain to manage pfizer or moderna or because of the cost so as long as you know it gets used you know we we're not facing you know a severe problem with with astrazeneca chris the europeans were hoping from day one that they would have a comprehensive united approach when it comes to tackling kovid 19 acquiring the same vaccine from astrazeneca and moving forward the germans are saying now that they are in talks with the russians for sputnik vaccine could this be an indication that we're seeing some cracks within the eu itself about dealing with astrazeneca in the near future i think we've seen cracks in the eu right from the get-go and and i don't think that they have made themselves look particularly honorable or really bolstered their reputation internationally i think quite the opposite in fact interesting that they're going down the route of the russian sputnik vaccine though because they hasn't been approved yet that we understand that the ema the european medicines agency are looking at that vaccine it's also very closely related to how astrazeneca's vaccine works it's a modified cold virus in fact it's a pair of cold viruses which are administered a few weeks apart it's also very similar to the johnson johnson vaccine that's also still waiting for approval in the uk what unites all these different vaccines is they're all based on modified cold viruses which are used as trojan horses to smuggle into the body the coronavirus coat message and therefore what is happening with astrazeneca's vaccine with this rare complication albeit at very low levels it could also affect the johnson johnson vaccine it could also affect the russian vaccine we haven't seen the data yet we haven't seen the follow-up on millions of people who've had it like have had the astrazeneca vaccine and that may yet emerge so it may well be that we see the same trend emerging with these other products subsequently we'll have to watch this space sana where does this leave the eu it's grappling with a third wave of cov19 a spike in infections death tools they've been lagging far behind when in terms of vaccinating large sections of their own society they have been grappling with ways to find new vaccines could this be the moment of reckoning as far as the europeans are concerned well certainly the timing isn't great uh as you say there's a third wave that is rolling across the continent and there are more and more restrictions coming into place just as in the uk we start to lift uh some of those restrictions um as early as uh next week so in this instance they do need to be accelerating the vaccine rollout as quickly as possible as jeffrey has highlighted however they do have a selection of other types of vaccines they could also be using but i i believe that they do have uh to think about how to best leverage their existing public health infrastructure to upskill certain health workers um and ensure that we they get as many jabs and arms as possible so that we don't uh end up in a situation where we have uh the french variant or the spanish variant um resulting in the fact of not only a combination of um vaccination rate but also vaccine hesitancy so again these are all very um particularly the latter is more complicated to address given some of the issues that we've discussed on astrazeneca uh but i think another point as well is that um outside of the uk and outside of the eu brazil for instance being one of the hotbeds of um cases at the moment and that situation is not looking good so i do think we need to zoom out and take a global uh approach yeah we're definitely and this is going to be my question to jeffrey about this is this whole thing has been an uncharted territory for for us and for the scientific community because they're dealing with a w with something new and they've been trying and testing new vaccines some of them using old technologies some of them using ultra-modern technologies don't you think that this whole thing about astrazeneca should be an opportunity for everyone to put into place a mechanism to monitor all the vaccines and look for any possible side effects that we might be overlooking right now absolutely so we have the kovacs facility which is a global mechanism for distributing the vaccines to to the poor low resource countries but we need like you say a global mechanism to oversee all the vaccines we also need that or similar mechanism to look at production because where we failed is in being able to produce enough doses of the vaccine so governments invested early in developing the vaccines and this has been one of the great scientific breakthroughs with so many successful vaccines but they haven't invested at the same level in the production and we know that vaccines require dozens of components from reagents to to vials and resins and so on so we need an overview of what what the availability of the different components are and a massive global pharmaco vigilance of any possible side effects since we're seeing something in the eu in the uk but we need to make sure that we're you know we're overseeing this in the rest of the world crazy less than 20 seconds if you don't mind what would be your message to those who bureaucrats and politicians doctors working in different parts of the world having to make that decision about sen allowing their own countries to continue using astrazeneca or not look at the data the risk profile is exceptionally good and the performance of the vaccine is very very high i have no conflict of interest i have no shares in astrozenic or anything like this but i do of course have a share in being a doctor myself and treating patients who are suffering with this disease which we can prevent with this vaccine it's an excellent vaccine thank you very much indeed i really appreciate your messages of hope at this particular moment when people are eager to see light at the end of the tunnel ,Astrazeneca vaccine_ safe or not safe_ _ Inside

15,"The laws brought on by consumers against AstraZeneca have the Indian internet once again up in arms about the K Shield vaccine. The lawsuit and the company's admission that the vaccine could cause some ""very rare"" side effects have led to a political furor, and unfortunately, many are mistakenly coming extremely close to sounding very much like those in the pseudoscientific anti-vaccination camp. This, today in 2024, is a serious cause for concern. While criticizing those in power is our right and even our obligation, some might say there are far more valid criticisms to be leveled against the Modi government for how they handled the pandemic or the vaccines than AstraZeneca's admission of these side effects. Owing to the really large risk to public health and observing in media how these vaccine-hesitant sentiments can get weaponized, vaccine risks are a subject that need to be touched upon very carefully in an informed manner. Vaccines are not without risk, but generally speaking, vaccines are not risky. Adverse events, as they are medically known, are concerning, so first, let's just look at these adverse events. What are these serious adverse events that are very rare? First of all, some people can be allergic to vaccines or ingredients used in any vaccine. These people would typically have a reaction within a couple of minutes of being administered the vaccine, which is why all of us are asked to wait in the hospital after we receive our vaccine for a while. Some other side effects are also known; some get severe nausea and headache, some have diarrhea, etc. These might persist for a day or two or maybe even a week, but they will resolve by themselves. Fever is also a common symptom, and this is not a bad symptom; this is a good symptom because that's what a vaccine is supposed to do, so no worries there. The identified side effect that AstraZeneca has admitted to is called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS. Thrombosis is the production of blood clots in the bloodstream, and thrombocytopenia is low platelet levels in the blood. TTS can lead to the production of blood clots in the body, and these blood clots can travel through the blood vessels, through the veins or arteries, and can be life-threatening, especially if they reach the brain. Thrombosis is not really unheard of; it happens quite frequently in medical conditions. It can happen to people who are otherwise healthy but are injured or are pregnant, have cancer, have had a long surgery, or even those who are on specific oral contraceptives. Thrombocytopenia, low blood count, occurs in liver patients or those with certain autoimmune diseases. But the combination, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, is not really frequently found, and outside of cancer patients, it's not really found much. This is, of course, when it is unrelated to vaccination. When TTS is induced by vaccination, it is called vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT. That is the condition that is more accurate to what we're talking about, and that is the one that AstraZeneca has owned up to. VITT was first identified in March 2021. It sets in anywhere from five to 30 to 42 days of treatment, and it is largely caused due to a genetic mutation called PF4 (platelet factor four). Those with this genetic mutation tend to have a tendency to get VITT after vaccination. So firstly, if it's been over a month since getting the vaccination and symptoms like stroke or, you know, death have not presented themselves, the vaccinated people are safe from VITT. Today, TTS is rare, and in medical terminology, very rare means extremely, extremely, extremely rare—like one in a million at least rare. This is even more true for VITT. But what really exactly is the numerical probability? I personally like saying that a person is more likely to get hit by lightning than experience an adverse effect due to a vaccine. This is not a new comparison or original; many medical professionals have long used this lightning comparison to indicate the low risk of adverse events from any vaccine. And here's what studies have actually shown: a 2021 UK study found 79 cases of VITT in over 20 million vaccinations of Covishield of AstraZeneca; another 2021 study showed 28 cases in 17 million AstraZeneca vaccines; a 2022 study showed 7.5 per million, and a 2024 study, quite recent, from multiple countries showed only seven in nearly 99 million individuals across different types of vaccines, not just Covishield. These are some of the innumerable studies done on the safety of these vaccines, specifically the safety of Covishield itself. The probability of experiencing adverse events is so extremely low because vaccines have been around since the 1800s and have saved, at this point, billions of lives. We have completely eliminated two diseases because of vaccines: smallpox in humans and rinderpest in cattle. If vaccines were going about killing one in 50,000 people, or even one in 250,000 people, as some people online seem to think, we wouldn't really be rolling vaccines across the globe for decades. Those are risky numbers. The safety profiles of vaccines have been well established for decades already. Covishield is an adenovirus vector vaccine, and these are also extremely frequently used, so people have wondered whether the vaccine itself can cause an infection. So for that, we need to understand how these adenovirus vector vaccines work exactly and how these mRNA vaccines work and what the difference between them is. Adenovirus vector vaccines, or ad vector vaccines, use an adenovirus as a vector or a carrier. In these vaccines, a weakened adenovirus that is incapable of causing infection, disease, or dividing to multiply is used to carry protein into the body. In this case, what is being carried is the spike protein alone of the coronavirus, so the coronavirus also cannot infect. The virus, the adenovirus itself, might not be able to cause disease, but it still knows how to latch onto our body, so it gets inside the body through the vaccine, and the immune system can, of course, quickly kill a single virion or even a group of viruses. And when it does so, it then encounters the spike protein that is being carried by the adenovirus. The immune system realizes that the spike protein is a foreign body and promptly mounts an attack. This then leads the vaccine recipient to get a fever because the body is raising temperature, and that is harmful to pathogens. The immune system then eventually trains itself to identify the spike protein and thus can stave off an actual COVID virus if it comes to infect us later. mRNA vaccines here need a special mention because they are brand new. This is the first time that we are using mRNA vaccines. mRNA is like a secret letter that gets read and then promptly burned. Instructions in an mRNA are decoded, and this is basically like a computer program that is being executed, and it makes the body actually build and synthesize a fake synthetic spike protein. The same immune attack process then repeats, and the mRNA, in fact, was long destroyed before the protein was even produced. So mRNA vaccines are safe, and ad vector vaccines are also really safe. They are very common and widely used. In fact, vaccines against HIV, Ebola, TB, and even the flu are often ad vector vaccines, and we know very well how to work with them. The work itself in India was done by the Serum Institute of India in Pune. Now, Serum Institute is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and has been pushing out vaccines since 1966. Today, they make 1.9 billion doses a year of vaccines, and if a person in India gets a tetanus shot or a newborn gets an MMR vaccine, chances are that they are Serum Institute vaccines. Serum Institute vaccines have been used by multiple countries, by WHO, UNICEF, and other such agencies for people across all ages. The recent AstraZeneca news coincides with the Electoral Bond news cycle, both having ""institute"" in common, but the billionaire owner of Serum Institute, the company itself, and the bonds are independent of the Covishield vaccine. Safety and efficacy: Serum Institute vaccines have been safe, reliable, and accessible, costing the lowest in the world, which are the main things that are pertinent to our discussion today. Besides, any other maker would have had to use the same formula because this vaccine is from AstraZeneca, and it was developed by Oxford University. All of this that we talked about until now is the necessary information to provide context with which we have to understand the recent AstraZeneca acceptance of rare cases and the lawsuit. India has a strong vaccine legacy; we do not have a history of an organized anti-vaxxer movement that has taken hold of America. Our vaccine logistics are extremely impressive, even for an Indian citizen. Infrastructure, of course, ought to be to this standard across the board, but that's a different discussion. We have study data, enough data to be able to say that the Covishield vaccine is safe and reliable for its purpose. First, these vaccines reduce deaths—that is the primary purpose of vaccines. Then they reduce serious disease—another benefit of vaccines. Then they prevent disease altogether—another advantage. And lastly, they prevent transmission from one vaccinated person to any other person. If the vaccine does the first, which is preventing death, it is successful. This isn't to say that the vaccine is 100% free from side effects; nothing is 100%. There are indeed notable ones that the company has admitted to, such as VITT, and also others like encephalitis and myelitis that have been detected and have been known a month into the rollout of the vaccines globally. The numbers are very, very low, but nothing is new. There is no information in the lawsuit or in AstraZeneca's statement that we do not know already. The side effects information is included in the vaccine packaging itself, and many countries have indeed adjusted their vaccine rollout policies based on these adverse effects. Some countries in the European Union had temporarily halted the AstraZeneca vaccine briefly, but then immediately resumed when reports clearly began to show within a few days that these cases of VITT are extremely rare. Nothing is completely effective for all people; there is no 100% efficacy for 100% of the people who receive a therapeutic or a vaccine. Medicines are biochemicals that interact with our body, and our heterogeneous population, where we are all different from each other, will inevitably carry people with one or two of the millions of genetic mutations that could cause a person to react adversely to a therapeutic or a vaccine. Over time, this becomes known; its risk is evaluated depending on how common these reactions are, and vaccines are modified if necessary. And even then, vaccines would not be 100% safe for 100% of the people who take them, and this is true for all vaccines. Even today, we take the polio vaccine. Polio is almost entirely eliminated except in difficult-to-access terrains in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hindu Kush. These are occupied by the mountains, regional tribes almost cut off from the rest of the world. OPV (oral polio vaccine) has a known and well-established side effect since it is a weakened form of the polio virus; in rare cases, it can actually cause the very disease that it is trying to prevent. And indeed, in 2021, a total of six polio cases were documented globally while ten generations of not just the Indian subcontinent but the entire world have received the vaccination. So there's that lightning number again. Forget vaccines; in rare cases, many users online have also pointed out that even paracetamol has extremely serious side effects. In some people, it can lead to bloody stools, back spasms, extremities turning blue, becoming dizzy or fainting, and not waking up, and more. Once again, even with paracetamol, such cases will occur within the first six weeks or 42 days of ingesting the medicine or taking a vaccine. The vaccine does not cause permanent change in our bodies. In medicine, a permanent change would indicate a genetic change, and these vaccines and medicines are incapable of modifying our DNA, so symptoms don't present themselves months later. The paranoia induced by the recent news and its various interpretations has led to a lot of confusion like this but has also led to some interesting questions. What about cardiac events? Cardiac events can be triggered by VITT, and that carries even less probability. But COVID, which has moved through our population silently and invisibly, is known to trigger serious cardiovascular issues and diabetes in otherwise completely healthy, fit, and sporty people. Many of us who have never tested positive for COVID would have still caught an asymptomatic infection. I myself have not had a sense of smell for nearly two years now, but I constantly tested whenever I felt sick and I never tested positive for COVID. I clearly got it at some point because a lack of smell is a symptom of long COVID, but not the vaccine. Likewise, many others would have also gotten COVID without knowing, and subsequent infections for COVID incidentally get worse, unlike other diseases. That is an actual mystery, but back to vaccines. Why does it take so long to approve a vaccine in general, and how come COVID vaccines got rolled out so quick? Well, vaccines need long trials to see the effects of vaccines over time. However, in an emergency situation like a pandemic, lack of time can be compensated numerically by increasing the number of people that are being tested, and that is what happened with the COVID vaccines. Besides, these vaccines did not come out unnaturally quick. Covaxin was asked to be launched in one and a half months in time for India's Independence Day. That would have been unnaturally quick and, in fact, impossible. So these are all not concerns to suddenly take up at this point. Besides, there is absolutely nothing new in the recent development. Why are we agitating over something we knew more than three years ago? There are things that we still do not know, and those things we deserve answers to. How many cases were there in India, and how many adverse events were reported in India? Oops, we don't know. Here we have hit the meat of the matter. The right question to be asked is: where is the adverse event reporting in India? The US has a system called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, and the Indian version of that is the Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) system. This exists for a reason, and data here is required to make our vaccines as perfect as we can and reduce the medically rare risk that exists today. However, there is no available website or dashboard where adverse events from India are available or can be recorded. When someone experiences an adverse event, not many people know that the first thing to be done is to contact the Ministry of Health. People don't know how to report these events. It's too late for the COVID vaccine now, but the lack of national-level data like this reduces transparency and responsibility, and those are the more valid things that need to be questioned. There are two subjects in the overlapping political and scientific discourse that are sacrosanct and that need a lot of context and knowledge to be touched upon: vaccines and climate change. Behind every headline and update are thousands and thousands of scientists who have crunched up numbers built upon the work of thousands more. Discussing these topics and raising questions about them requires a deeper knowledge and context for the safety of our own citizens and future generations. All of this is not to say that the vaccine rollout in India was smooth and without fault. Scientists were asked to get out a vaccine in one and a half months. How? As cases spread, there were election rallies being held. How come Coronil makers are apologizing now? What's up with that? Efficacy of Covaxin—where's the data? Adverse reporting is non-existent—why? All valid questions, but they are all firmly on one side of the line of vaccine safety. This side has questions that are already answered: vaccines are good, even when companies are sued.",How safe is AstraZeneca Covid vaccine & why there is no need to panic,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDz0K6_qVJ4,16329,vaccine
16,"was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market? The Pfizer representative said no. Now, this exchange has been characterized by some as being a bombshell, as being news, as being something that the Pfizer representative admitted to, and also it has been characterized as completely upending the science on the ability of the COVID-19 vaccines to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Is that actually the case? Let's take a look. So, here we have at the top SARS-CoV-2, and as you can see, what happens here is that it infects a person, and that's the primary case. From there, there are trickle-down effects that happen very inefficiently. So, only about 3.4 percent hospitalization occurs, and then from there the patient may go to the critical care as a percentage of hospitalization, and then finally they may die as a percentage of critical care involvement. So, as we go down this line here, the number of people that reach this endpoint is dramatically reducing. The same thing if we go down here to secondary cases; that would be a transmission from one person to another. So, imagine that you're a vaccine maker and you want to make a vaccine that prevents these things. You're going to want to get the most amount of patients into your trial as possible so you can reach an endpoint. What do I mean by that? Imagine that you're a mile away, and I have a pile of dirt, and I have another pile of dirt. From a mile away, you can't tell the difference between those two piles of dirt. You have to get closer, and the closer you get, the better you're able to resolve the differences between those two peaks of dirt. The same sort of thing if you're looking at something on a screen that has low resolution. It's difficult to see through the pixelation; you need a better and better resolution to be able to see the difference. Well, that's the same sort of thing in studies. When you are doing a study, you're trying to resolve the difference about whether or not a vaccine is going to help with a virus. And the way you do that is by increasing the number of patients. Well, the problem is it's to resolve death. That's a very small pile of dirt, and you're going to have to get really, really close to be able to see that. You're going to have to have a level of resolution that is pretty good. I mean, it's going to be 4K. And the reason is because only one percent of people who get infections will actually go to death. And so, that's the same thing not only for death but also for critical care, for hospitalization, and even—here's the key—for secondary cases. Secondary cases happen as a result of primary cases, but you're gonna have to have more people to be able to see whether or not there are secondary cases because you have to see, first of all, whether or not a primary case happens. And then you need to watch them and test people around them to see if there's a secondary case. The bottom line is it takes a lot more people to do that in your study. It takes a lot more time, and it takes a lot more money. And all you really need to show to get emergency use authorization for your vaccine is to show that you can block this—you can block primary infection. That's all you have to show to get emergency use authorization. You don't need to show that you can block this. You don't need to show that you can block this. You don't need to show that you can block this. You don't need to show that you can block this. All of those are not necessary for emergency use authorization. So, you have a choice: Do you want to pay ten times the amount of money and get ten times more people and have your study last three, or four, or five times as long to get the same emergency use authorization? Or do you just want to see whether or not you can get emergency use authorization based on the fact that you can prevent disease in the person getting the vaccine, the recipient? You can obviously see what the best answer is. This doesn't mean that you won't do these studies; it just means that you won't do it before it goes to market. In other words, you don't need to do it before emergency use authorization, only after emergency use authorization. Let's delve into that and see if that is a dirty secret or a well-known fact. So, here's an article that I want you to look at, and notice first that it was published on the 21st of October of 2020. Let me state that again: October of 2020. That was even before we had emergency use authorization for any vaccine. And this was published in the British Medical Journal, written by Peter Doshi. ""Will COVID-19 vaccines save lives? Current trials aren't designed to tell us that."" Well, yeah. In order to tell us whether or not it saves lives, you have to power it for death, and death is such a rare event at this point in time that you would have to have a lot of people in that study to be able to do that. It says here, ""Severe illness requiring hospital admission, which happens in only a small fraction of symptomatic COVID-19 cases, would be unlikely to occur in significant numbers in trials."" 3.4 percent hospitalization rate. You'd have to involve thirty thousand or more to be able to do the trial, and you would actually need more than that to be able to look at severe disease because there'd only be a few even in a trial of 30,000. And actually, the Pfizer trial was 36,000. They say in all the ongoing phase three trials—this is a key word here—phase three trials. This is the phase right before emergency use authorization. And in all of them, we'll talk about this for which details have been released, laboratory-confirmed infections even with only mild symptoms qualifies meeting the primary endpoint of definition. In the Pfizer and Moderna trials, for example, people with only a cough and positive laboratory tests would bring those trials one event closer to their completion. In other words, they're going to count that as an event. In other words, they made up their minds already. This is what they're going after: primary cases. They're not going after hospitalization, they're not going after critical care, they're not going after preventing death, and they are not, importantly, going after secondary cases. Why? Because it would cost way too much money, and it would take way too long to be able to get to that endpoint. You have to realize here that it's not just a matter of money and time. But realize that people are literally dying in the hospital while this is going on. And so, the question is, if they can get something that can prevent infection in the primary case, that may be all they need to do to eventually prevent death down the road. They could actually do a study down the road to figure that out. Why spend the time now trying to figure all this stuff out when it could delay the implementation of this vaccine to the market? Here is the table that is associated with that article that was published back in October of 2020. You can see here we've got the different vaccines: Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Sinopharm, Sinovac, and you can see that the number of people that they have in their trial is perfectly powered to get the results of primary infections. You always have to power your study before you can register it, before you can start recruiting, before you get sponsorship. You have to know how many people are going to be in the study, and it has to do with a lot of things: the recruitment, the likelihood of your intervention to work. If you're going to see whether or not parachutes work with people jumping out of planes, you don't need to power that study really high to figure that out because we kind of know that parachutes are really effective—or at least we think so. And so, it's not like you're going to need a study of 10,000 people jumping out of planes to figure out that parachutes work. That kind of powering of the study could be done on maybe two or three people. It wouldn't be a very ethical study, but nevertheless, that's the kind of thing that we're talking about here. You look at the intervention, guess how many people you're going to need, what the event rates are, how many people you're going to have with endpoints, and then figure out whether or not it's going to meet statistical significance. And all of these companies came up with the same idea. Notice what else they came up with. They all decided to say, ""Hey, are we going to look for interruption of transmission, person-to-person spread?"" Moderna said nope. Pfizer said nope. AstraZeneca, in both the United States and the UK, said nope. Johnson & Johnson said nope. Sinopharm said nope. And Sinovac said nope. And why do they say that? Because of exactly what we just talked about. You're going to wait for somebody to get infected and then watch them and wait longer and then see whether or not other people around them get infected. Why? You can do that after emergency use authorization. You can do post-marketing studies to see whether or not that actually happens. It makes no sense whatsoever for a vaccine company to make that kind of an endpoint in a study that needs to get done quickly and efficiently at a time when people are dying in the hospital. So, let's look at what was happening. Here we have new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people. So, this is on a daily basis, and you can see here this blue bar is the period of time in which the phase three trial occurred. This was pretty early on. Notice not a lot of cases going on here. Not a lot of cases means that you're going to be hanging around for a while to reach that 30,000 endpoint because it's going to take a while to get there. Then you see what happens. After emergency use authorization in November and December, the cases start to skyrocket. Here's the death rate. You can see the same sort of thing. Not a lot of deaths going on here. Notice the dates here are March to November, so not a lot of deaths going on here because there's not a lot of cases. Now, once you get to the beginning of the pandemic in terms of the post-phase three trial, this is after the emergency use authorization happens, now we see the cases really going up. And by the way, the same thing is happening with the death rate as well. Notice the red bar here is the emergency use authorization from Pfizer. Notice the blue bar here. This is the beginning of the phase three trial. Notice where this is on the phase three trial period. Now, if they were to do secondary endpoints to see whether or not it reduces transmission and those types of things, it would have to be powered down here, but we're going to be waiting all the way until here to find out, and that's too late. That's way too late. People are going to be dying in this period of time, and it would be unethical to wait that long when you have a vaccine that clearly stops primary infections, which means it's going to stop a lot of secondary cases, just not all of them. And so, when we look at the original question here, which is, ""Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?"" the answer is no. And the reason is is because it didn't need to be because primary infections drive the other endpoints. It makes sense from a perspective of emergency use authorization. It doesn't make sense from a perspective of those that are trying to diminish the vaccine to point that out and say, ""Hey, that's a bombshell. That upends the science."" It actually doesn't. It is exactly what was intended, and it is exactly the ethical thing to do when you're developing a vaccine.
