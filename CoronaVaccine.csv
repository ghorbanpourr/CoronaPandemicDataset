What The COVID Vaccine Does To Your Body,AsapSCIENCE,2020-12-08,the81FQoAUI,"There's a lot of excitement right now around the record speed vaccines for COVID-19, some of which are already starting distribution in parts of the world. But given that these are mRNA vaccines are relatively new technology that has not been widely used before, we wanted to explain how they work and what happens to your body from the moment that needle touches your skin. Like the vaccines we're used to seeing, these vaccines will be injected into the upper muscle of your arm, but unlike typical vaccines which introduce inactive or weakened forms of a virus, these will release genetic material called messenger RNA. So what exactly does this mRNA do? Well, in a regular cell of your body, you have DNA inside of the nucleus. And this DNA stores all the information and instructions important to the functioning of your cells, your body, and ultimately makes you, you. Inside your cell is machinery that reads through your DNA and transcribes it into mRNA, which then leaves the nucleus and goes into your cytoplasm. And it's here that the ribosomes in your cells read the RNA, and depending on the specific code, build a series of amino acids which fold in on themselves to make proteins, which keep you alive and functioning. This process is known as translation. In fact, it's this process that viruses take advantage of in the first place. They insert their own genetic information into you and then your cell machinery unwittingly starts taking that information and building proteins to help create more viruses. So back to the needle. The mRNA that is being injected into you from the vaccine also carries genetic instructions. But in this case, it's only coding for one small part of the virus, instead of the whole thing. You've probably seen SARS-CoV-2 represented like this with the spikes on it, and it's this spike protein which on its own is harmless that the vaccines mRNA codes for. The mRNA makes its way into the cytoplasm of your cells where the ribosomes read the information and start to create the spike proteins. Once the protein is made, it goes to the cell membrane and then your cell breaks down and destroys the injected mRNA instructions. So what good does having a tiny fragment of viral spike in your body do? What gives your body, and more importantly your immune system, a preview of what the virus looks like without causing disease. Suddenly your antibodies will notice it and go, well, this doesn't belong here, which triggers an immune response to recognize and prepare your body for the real thing without ever having to come in contact with the actual virus itself. Your immune system essentially gets a head start by creating powerful antibodies that can neutralize and kill the real virus. And this antibody memory is stored in your B cells so that if you are ever infected in the future with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, your body now has the upper hand. This is known as an adaptive immune response. Your body has already seen these spike proteins before and therefore it already knows what to do. Essentially these mRNA vaccines allow your body to protect itself from a future infection without ever having to risk the consequences of getting the disease COVID-19. So why have an mRNA vaccine been used before? While they are relatively new, researchers have actually been experimenting with them for decades. But in the past they have been very unstable. Enzymes in your body would break down the mRNA quickly so they needed to be packaged well. The ones being released now have the mRNA encased in lipid nanoparticles, which essentially protect the mRNA from being degraded. Since they are more unstable than other types of vaccines, they have to be kept cold. For example, the Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius and at normal refrigerated temperatures can only last five days. Of course, a global pandemic has certainly increased the funding and resources going towards these types of vaccines, which has helped to accelerate their development. What makes these vaccines so appealing is that unlike other vaccines, they can be made in a lab with readily available materials and actually made much quicker than other types of vaccines. Instead of fully developing non-infectious viruses and then injecting them, these mRNA vaccines can sort of pass many hurdles by using your own body in an ingenious way. It's also far more cost-effective to create mRNA molecules rather than the proteins themselves and also a lot more scalable, which is helpful when we are in a global pandemic waiting for a vaccine. So, is it safe? And given that it's a relatively new technology, should you be concerned at all? Well, that's what these initial trial stages have been for, not only to test whether or not they work and cause immunity, but to make sure they have minimal side effects. As of now, around 70,000 people have been given these vaccines with no serious concerns, a caveat being that the full research hasn't been published yet as of recording this video. But it's important to remember that just because it's safe doesn't mean there won't be any soreness or pain. Some recipients did report aches and pains, and as of now, you'll need to receive two shots to ensure efficacy. I saw a really great analogy by the professor Shane Crawdy, who works in vaccine research, and he said, it's not unlike going to the gym and getting exercise and really sore muscles. A bit of pain can be a positive sign that good things are happening. Sometimes you have to earn your immunity, just like you have to earn those biceps you wanted so bad. We know you've been asking about these vaccines a lot. We've also had our questions, so we hope that all this information was useful and concise and educational for you because it does sort of help make things seem less unknown and scary in a very strange time. Thank you all so much for watching. If you want to hear more about vaccines, our podcast is on YouTube. You can check that out. We have a few episodes on vaccine gossip about vaccines to be honest, but don't ask steering all the doors. You love to see gossip about vaccines. Otherwise, make sure you like this video, subscribe, and we'll see you next time for some more science. See you."
Covid Vaccine Study Finds Links to Health Conditions,Bloomberg Television,2024-02-19,im3otpqYAiQ,"In terms of how widespread the adverse event reporting has been, talk us through what the findings were. Yeah, so these findings are not really at all surprising. We've known about these side effects really since the vaccines began rolling out at the end of 2020, early 2021. We've seen this myocarditis inflammation of the heart muscle, pericarditis inflammation of the sac around the heart, as well as this unusual blood clot that forms in the brain from the virus vector vaccines. So none of these findings are new, but they are actually fairly reassuring because they didn't find anything else that was alarming. And I did look at a few different vaccine types as well. Was there any difference across them? There was indeed. Yes, they did see this increased risk for the brain blood clot in relation to the AstraZeneca viral virus vector vaccine. And also we did see the increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis with the mRNA vaccines, the other ones made by Pfizer, a Biontech and Moderna. There were some other interesting findings as well. Guillain-Barray syndrome was shown to be an event of concern linked to, mostly to the Oxford AstraZeneca virus vector vaccine. Otherwise, everything else was pretty much as we had already expected things. So and we've talked about some of those pre-established conditions of interest. Did they find anything that was pertinent across that subsection of the study? Beyond those 13 events that they were looking for, they didn't see, they weren't looking specifically for other aspects of vaccine injury that has been noted in the past, post-Rothostatic Tachycardia syndrome that's this increased heart rate that has been noted in relation to vaccines. As the researchers have also seen it in a higher frequency associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So while the vaccines were known to be associated with this problem, they are actually occurring more frequently from an infection."
Kansas sues Pfizer over COVID-19 vaccine,FOX31 Denver,2024-06-18,AjexZeFPTWY,"Colorado's neighbor state to the east Kansas now suing Pfizer claiming the company misrepresented its COVID-19 vaccine putting the health of Americans at risk Specifically pregnant women. Yeah tonight the pharmaceutical company is responding Fox 31's tally cunning hand brings us up to speed on both sides tallya Well, Erica good evening the 69 page civil suit was filed just yesterday by the state's attorney general at Chris Koehbock And it alleges that Pfizer violated the Consumer Protection Act by marketing the vaccine as safe Even though the company knew it was connected to serious adverse reactions then misleading the public that suits states that during the pandemic 60 percent of Kansas residents received the Pfizer vaccine Misleading them to believe their vaccine was safe for certain users including pregnant women and people with specific heart issues So in co box complaint a 2021 Pfizer report shows that of the 488 pregnant women who got that Pfizer vaccine more than half of them had an adverse event and more than 10 percent reported miscarriages Koehbock believes that Pfizer knowingly withheld information regarding serious side effects And a time when vaccinating yourself from COVID-19 seemed like a life or death choice for some and they're unborn children Company has a High obligation to be honest with Americans And you do not deceive consumers and you especially must not deceive consumers When consumers are making an urgent frantic decision Believing that their life might be on the line In response to this Pfizer is responding tonight saying in part quote We are proud to have developed the COVID-19 vaccine and record time in the midst of a global pandemic and saved countless lives The representations made by Pfizer about its COVID-19 vaccine have been accurate and science-based the state's case has no merit So Kansas is the second state to sue Pfizer after Texas filed its lawsuit last fall Koehbock says this is going to be a multi-state effort and decline to answer today whether he himself got the Pfizer vaccine In studio tie a cunning handbox 31"
AstraZeneca starts worldwide withdrawal of COVID vaccine,Sky News,2024-05-08,ilF4juaCpLY,"In the dark days of lockdown, AstraZeneca's COVID jab was quite literally the shot in the arm we needed. Billions of doses later, its time is up; the vaccine was withdrawn by the company because of falling demand. AstraZeneca’s family won’t miss it; she died 19 days after having the jab in Italy, and they’re taking legal action against the pharmaceutical giant. My family and I are not against vaccination; we want to clarify this. When my sister died, we invited people to get vaccinated as long as it was a safe vaccine, and for us, AstraZeneca unfortunately was not a safe vaccine. Brian Pinker was the first to have the Vaxzevria vaccine in January 2021. Boris Johnson also had the jab, heaping praise on the Oxford University scientists who developed it. In its first year, 3 billion doses were distributed, with more than 6 million lives saved, but the United States never licensed the vaccine, and as clotting concerns grew, it was suspended or withdrawn first in Denmark and then in several other European countries. While in the UK, it was restricted first only to be used in people over 30, then those over 40, and its legacy should be definitely a positive one rather than a negative one. So, across the height of the pandemic, the AstraZeneca vaccine was indeed the vaccine for the world. It was a vaccine that was much cheaper to manufacture; it could be stored at fridge-like temperatures rather than the ultra-cold chain, the ultra-frozen temperatures that were needed by Pfizer and Moderna. So it was much easier to transport to, for example, rural settings in Africa and be deployed there. AstraZeneca has always insisted the vaccine's benefits outweigh the risks. A spokesperson added, “We are incredibly proud of the role Vaxzevria played in ending the global pandemic.” Multiple variant COVID-19 vaccines have since been developed; this has led to a decline in demand for Vaxzevria, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied. But the biotech that underpins the vaccine may survive, perhaps tweaked to avoid blood clots, ready for the next race against a virus. Thomas More, Sky News."
Doctor Dies After Getting COVID Vaccine? Post Vaccine Deaths,Doctor Mike Hansen,2021-01-20,UijQ-6jhVuc,"Hey guys, welcome to another video. Yesterday I was seeing one of my patients in the pulmonary clinic and she was asking me about my thoughts about getting the COVID vaccine. She also asked me if I heard about the doctor in Florida who died after getting the first Pfizer vaccination. So this is something I want to talk about. So there was an obstetrician, gynecologist in Miami who received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on December 18th and shortly after receiving the vaccine, he reportedly developed acute immune thrombo cytophenium. He died 16 days after getting the vaccine. His cause of death being a result of brain hemorrhage or bleeding into the brain. Obviously this is horrible, it's tragic and you have to feel for his family. But it makes you wonder was his death a result of the vaccine. And if it was a result of the vaccine, should that change your perspective on getting the vaccine. So I'm going to tell you my thoughts on this, but first let's learn a little bit more about what happened. Pfizer is actively investigating the case, but they don't seem to think that the vaccine is the cause of this. So far over 10 million people in the United States have received at least one shot of either the Pfizer or the Moderna COVID vaccine. These are the two authorized in the United States as of right now. Me personally, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which overall went very smoothly. Now so far, there have been about 40 cases of anaphylaxis as a result of these vaccines, meaning a severe allergic reaction, none of which were reported as being fatal. And many people have had other side effects that are very common out of the vaccine like having a sore arm, having some fatigue, headache or fever. And this typically lasts a day or two. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner's Office is investigating this death as well. And as of right now, there is no official autopsy report. But based off the reports, let's see what we can make of this case. So this man was healthy. He did not smoke. He did not take any medications. Never had any reaction to any medication or vaccines. Supposedly, three days after he gets the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccination, he gets tiny reddish spots or a particular eye caused by bleeding under the skin of his hands and feet. This prompted him to go to the ER. He gets blood work done and his platelet levels are low. And this is something called thrombocytopenia. Platelets are one of the components of blood clotting. If platelets are too low, it makes people more prone to bleeding. Normal platelets counts range from anywhere from 150,000 to 400,000 or so. People can have spontaneous bleeding, including internal bleeding, but that doesn't typically happen unless the platelet levels are less than 10,000. His levels were reportedly zero. And because they're so low or absent, really, he gets admitted to the intensive care unit. For two weeks, doctors tried to get his platelet count higher as he had experts from all over the country involved in his care. Now, presumably, they tried a number of different treatments. Typically, we give platelet transfusions, which is really a blood product that we're transfusing. But also, we give steroids, specifically glucocorticoids, such as salimedral or methyl prednisolone. If that doesn't work, we try other drugs like Ramoplastim or El Trombopag to try to stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets. Sometimes we give immunoglobulins. Sometimes we give a drug called Rituximab, which is a monoclonal antibody. If all else fails, the last resort is to take out the spleen, because sometimes the spleen plays a role in sequestering and destroying platelets. So they were actually planning on doing a splenectomy, meaning removing his spleen. But shortly before that, he ends up developing a hemorrhagic stroke that took his life in a matter of minutes. In other words, he bled into his brain. Now, just because someone bleeds into their brain, it doesn't necessarily mean that they die. But what happens is, if the bleeding is severe enough, the pressure starts building up inside the skull. And this is known as raised intra cranial pressure. And this compresses the brain. And eventually, the pressure forces the brain down through the base of the skull, that big hole at the bottom of the skull known as the Pharremin Magnum. When this happens, the only life-saving option is the emergent brain surgery, where a neurosurgeon does a craniotomy to relieve the intra cranial pressure. But his bleeding was so severe and happened so quickly it took his life. And his thrombocytopenia was not only severe, but it wasn't getting better despite all the treatments that they tried. And this leads to the question, why does a healthy guy, all of a sudden, get severe thrombocytopenia to the point of bleeding to death? Because no matter what the cause is, this kind of thing is incredibly rare. I've never had a similar case like this in the intensive care unit. Now, there are some cases like this reported with certain drugs. Medications can lead to thrombocytopenia as a result of drug-induced antibodies being made by the immune system that end up attacking the body's platelets. So, drug-induced thrombocytopenia refers to acute immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, and it should be suspected when someone has a sudden severe thrombocytopenia. So, DITP or drug-induced thrombocytopenia is even more strongly suspected when a patient has repeated episodes of a sudden severe drop in the platelet count. By far, the most common drugs that cause this are things like Quinnidine, the Bloodthinner Heparin, and then also sulfonolureas, like trimethyprim, sulthamethoxysol, aka backdrum, and also there's other antibiotics that are fairly common that cause this as well. So, it's not just drugs that can cause this, but also certain foods, herbal remedies, and one vaccine, the MMR vaccine. The risk of ITP occurring within six weeks after getting the MMR vaccination is increased. However, the attributable risk of thrombocytopenia within six weeks after MMR vaccination remains overall low at one in 25,000 vaccinated children. Now, complications or long-term consequences of ITP in this age group are rare. For the majority of children less than six years of age, the illness is self-limiting. Vaccines stimulate the immune system, and in theory, could in rare cases cause it to mistakenly identify some of a patient's own cells as enemy invaders that should be destroyed. But with that said, millions of various vaccinations are given every year, and clusters of thrombocytopenia don't occur. In regarding the COVID vaccine, millions of doses have been given, and so far, there are no other reports or associations with low platelet counts. So, did the Pfizer vaccine cause this? Based on the timing of things, it seems like it, but it's too early to come to a conclusion one way or another. We have to know all the facts and understand the autopsy report, but even then, it's still not a guarantee that we come to a solid conclusion. Although this is an incredibly sad story, and even if it does prove that the vaccine did cause this, I hope people aren't dissuaded from getting the vaccine because this type of thing is still very incredibly rare. Every decision we make in medicine is based on risk versus benefit. And when you compare the risks of COVID and the risks and benefits of the vaccine, the benefits outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. In fact, there are lots of COVID patients in the intensive care unit that have thrombocytopenia, so that is something else to put in perspective. Knowing more details about this case might help us to better device treatment plans in case this happens again in other people after they get the vaccine, but I doubt we're going to hear many more cases like this. Anyway, that's all I have for this video. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one."
"Soldier claims COVID vaccine caused heart attacks, stroke | Cuomo",NewsNation,2024-06-24,cw2HDMK2wEM,"Our leaders and our media, they're both making a mistake ignoring long COVID and vaccine-related side effects, okay? They're not going anywhere. It's only going to get worse and we have to make it matter. Especially when it affects our warriors in the line of duty. Then you have an enhanced duty of care. We have to make it matter, so let's get after it. 24-year-old Army National Guard Specialist, Carolina Stansick, okay? She says, like many in the military, she was urged by superiors to take the COVID vaccine. So she did not unusual. What is unusual? She immediately suffered severe adverse reactions, three heart attacks thereafter, and a stroke, okay? Young, strong, fit for duty. 19 months, the Defense Department refused to cover her medical expenses. 70 grand plus. This happened on their watch. According to a new report, the Department of Defense now acknowledges that Carolina's debilitating heart condition called POTS may have been caused by the COVID vaccine. And that, her developing the heart condition was considered or is now considered a line of duty injury. Now this is a huge admission by the military, but it took to damn long. Joining us now, Army National Guard Specialist, Carolina Stansick and, and very important, especially to Carolina, Jeremy Sorenson advocated to get the Department of Defense to acknowledge her injury. That's what he does, okay? And it is very important that we take up this cause ourselves. So first, Carolina, how are you doing now? What's the situation? Hi there, Kirsten. Thank you so much for having me on your show. Obviously, thoughts, views, opinions, and experiences are my own, and I represent myself and not the DOD or the US Army. I guess the closest thing that has recently happened is I, three weeks ago, got a pacemaker surgery. How are you feeling? What are they telling you? So I went in for a surgery to get my heart monitored. And within one week, they were saying that my heart was stopping, and I got started on a heart failure med. I pretty much was going through like another big flare where I was going to go back to the hospital, and then they had called me and said, you need a pacemaker like now. I lost all my privileges for driving, just like daily living, but I would say it's helped significantly just kind of reversing some of the things I've been dealing with for the last three years. And do your doctors have any question as to whether or not the vaccine had something to do with what happened after you had the vaccine? They don't, and I have multiple letters that have stated that the vaccine was the issue. Now, don't go anywhere, obviously. Jeremy, first of all, thank you very much for the work that you do with your organization, helping veterans get the care and the attention that they need. How surprising was it to you when you learned about what's in the file, what the doctors were saying, that this was as difficult as it was to get acknowledged by the government? Well, thank you, Chris, for having me on and having special a stance at gone this morning and bringing this issue to light. Unfortunately for me, it was not surprising at all because I've seen so many of these cases of the Department of Defense, specifically the National Guard denying that injuries, illnesses and diseases have been incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. It's really quite frankly for traditional reservists and guardsmen, very regularly, very regular for the Department of Defense, the US Army, US Air Force, the National Guard to deny that medical conditions happen in the line of duty in order to save the government money by denying service members, medical care, military status, disability retirement benefits, etc. So I'd love to say that I was surprised, wasn't a bit surprised, Chris, when I saw what was in special a stance at 6'5"".

Covid vaccines are safe,Dr. John Campbell,2024-02-04,m2skKkRwYj8,"Welcome to today's talk. It's Sunday the 4th of February 2024. Now in my country we have some in called Prime Minister's question time where members of parliament can ask the Prime Minister questions. Now this was the British Prime Minister last Wednesday the 31st of January not 2021 but 2024 just a few days ago Prime Minister. Let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that COVID vaccines are safe. Now I know that you'll be struggling with credulity at this point so I don't want to quote the Prime Minister out of context. So let's look at the context now. Mr Andrew Bridgin asks the question and Richie Sue Nack the Prime Minister answers the question. Let's just watch the whole exchange only less for a couple of minutes. Mr Bridgin thank you Mr Speaker. More than two decades ago the then Prime Minister Tony Blair misled this House by promoting and endorsing the post office horizon IT system as perfect protecting the large corporation that created it and causing untold harm and damage and misery to innocent people. Can the current Prime Minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge businesses as safe and effective which is ultimately harm the British people and will he use this opportunity to correct that safe and effective statement or will he choose the same line as Tony Blair sit back do nothing and let the misery just continue to pile up. Prime Minister. Mr Speaker as we've been clear the horizon scandal is a terrible miscarriage of justice and we're doing everything that we can to make it right and to what he was more broadly insinuating let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that covid vaccines are safe. Mr Speaker. Now your Member of Parliament may well have been if you live in the UK one of those that was poo pooing. Mr Bridgin when he said safe and effective and he may your elected Member may well have been one of the ones that were cheering when Mr Richie Sue and Acc said the vaccines are safe notice he didn't say they were effective this time. He did say they were safe now let's just look at some in more information on this here. Now this is the the channel where you can watch that that's the official UK Parliament channel where it's all available check out the link for yourself and we also have this document called hand side which records everything and that's the link for that check it out for yourself. Can the current Prime Minister think of anything he has promoted in partnership with huge business as safe and effective as ultimately harm the British people. So clearly Mr Bridgin there is talking about the vaccines and he gives the Prime Minister an opportunity to correct previous errors. Now the Prime Minister here is talking about the horizons now that this horizons scandal there was this terrible thing where postmasters were accused of theft and it wasn't it was the computer system goes way back to Tony Blair you might have heard of him something to do with was it an invasion of a racco or something like that something like that. Anyway sticking to the point this horizon was scandal was ignored but recently it all come clean and these poor innocent people who suffered greatly have been completely exonerated although not adequately compensated yet. The analogies are there Mr Bridgin of course they did advocate for the horizon victims in his own constituency quite strongly at the time but again was poo pooed as he is now so he was sitting drawing this kind of analogy there so the Prime Minister had this opportunity to say just a minute but he actually said this let me be unequivocal so let me be unequivocal and I think when he said unequivocal is that the point where he banged his hand down said this is unequivocal and this is from the dispatch box now in the UK that means it's this dispatch box at the Prime Minister talks on the parliament. Basically is saying by the authority vested in me as the British Prime Minister Covid vaccines are safe and effective. Sorry there's a cross out safe there my mistake so there you go now I'm not just blaming but I am contribute such critiquing Mr Sue lack of course unequivocal high-am I think is wrong but we have his majesty's opposition in this country that is supposed to say just a minute government let me get you in check here so Richie Sue Nack says something carestime with the leader of the opposition should be honest feet in second saying just a minute what about way back to the Joseph Raymond paper what about the Ello card data what about all the international data that shows unequivocal evidence of vaccine arms no nothing just a hooray and they went on to the next point so there we have it that was the that they were the exchanges in the British Parliament British Prime Minister 31st of January 2024 let me be unequivocal from this dispatch box that Covid vaccines are safe unbelievable but at least it didn't say effective now I just a couple of lighter points now to finish off with we did a video a few days ago and no quite a rough use lawyer on either mectin use in Africa and those patients that were treated with either mectin in Africa for the scabies are just virtually cured I'm going to be showing some videos that I've just been sent a couple of days ago I might do them tomorrow don't think we've got time today but I made an error in the video so as always I'll come back to apologise so apologies and correction from from John bad mistake I made in that video in this video I wrongly say that the scabies might are insects they are not they are correctly classified as a rack nadia this is because the adult might have eight legs as spiders do so they're in the same group as spiders not insects and of course even someone who's done school biology knows that all insects have six legs and the mites are actually 0.2 to 0.4 5 millimeters not 10 times bigger as I said so I simply put the decimal point in the wrong place so my apologies for that and hopefully normal service will be resumed so my mistake sorry if I've missed let anyone but the content of the video and the videos of course absolutely valid totally I've a mectin in combination with hygiene and cleaning the clothes basically eradicated the wretched curse of scabies from that family and with many others that's just one we chose to a video from our community health project in Africa now I'm going to read a couple of the comments from that video now as we've said before there's a whole qualitative research project in looking at these video comments of anyone bothered to do it but I'm just going to read out a couple of comments on the from the ivomectin and scabies video now this says I'm not going to read out the names of the commentators but you can look at it they're all there they're in the public domain during the pandemic I caught the delta version of the size coronavirus two and was very sick strangely I contacted scabies the same week not wanting to infect my doctor I foe my doctor managed to get a prescription of ivomectin a day later I was better so excellent I'd say that it's very strange coincidence getting scabies and delta variant all at the same time although I must say personally I do keep ivomectin in the house just in case I get scabies another one here my brother doctor William Colby started the ivomectin distribution program in the Congo basin in the 1980s one billion doses and not one complaint now this is doses given to human beings not to horses not to cows the human beings a billion doses and not one complaint according to this comment I have noticed that there is absolutely no COVID in the COVID base and not even in the goma refugee camp where there is TB in starvation nothing to see here I can't possibly comment of course but congratulations to doctor William Colby for starting the ivomectin distribution program in Congo in the 1980s and there's many other comments I'm just going to give you the gist of one of them again I'm not just I'm just reporting what's been commented don't know if the trauma not can't tell it's just comments but they're in the public domain you can read them for yourself and I've had long COVID and I've been on oxygen at five liters for two years 24 seven and at some point this commentator says I found some 12 milligram tubeless of ivomectin and in 24 hours my oxygen saturation levels rose to pre-code COVID levels my mind cleared overnight from the fog my ears are ringing and improving my eyesight is improved today I went to my old doctor to show him your video the already was ahead of me he prescribed 40 milligrams a day for two weeks but I told him I would like to try 20 milligrams per day because 12 milligrams rocked my world and increased the level if needed a little more detail about the individual there this has been a miracle in my life no machine day or night and I assume he was referring to the oxygen concentration machine and he also refers to some personal tragedy so that they're in the comments there now of course I have no idea whether they're correct or not they're just comments and whatever you do do not take medicines based on what we say on this channel we do not prescribe you need to go to your doctor for that but interesting that those things are in the comments and again congratulations to doctor William Colby for his brilliant work in the Congo eradicating things like river blindness and elephantiasis the massive swelling of the limbs the terrible blindness and of course huge range of other parasitic diseases and now almost certainly ivomectin eradicating scabies as well although scabies keeps popping up because people keep getting reinfected so there we go let me know what you think of the British Prime Minister's comments."
Encephalitis After COVID-19 Vaccine Administration: Perspectives,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2023-02-26,i9JLZuhqRuU,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. Today we're going to review a couple of papers that go into detail about autopsy findings in patients with disease in the heart related to spike protein who have been previously vaccinated. And specifically we're going to look at the brain and the heart in a particular case where someone died with encephalitis. The MedCram have talked extensively about the vaccines and not only their efficacy, but also side effects. And that goes back to April of 2021 when we covered the vaccine pause of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as it related to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. There was about six cases out of six million cases at that time. And we also covered in September of 2021 in our video called COVID vaccines 10 key questions answered with Rhonda Patrick where we delved into the connection between mRNA vaccines and myocarditis. As a pulmonary and critical care physician in full practice and on the faculty at two medical schools, the side effects of medications are not foreign to me. I use these medications all the time in the intensive care unit and one of the medications that we see used often but also with side effects are blood thinners. And so it was a privilege for me to be involved in research prior to the pandemic in 2017 where we looked at clinical outcomes of prolonged anti-coagulation with river oxyban, which is a blood thinner, after unprovoked venous thromboembolism. People who have blood clots and we don't know why they have blood clots get put on anti-coagulation for a set period of time and then they are taken off of anti-coagulation. And so the question is, is how long should they be on it and whether or not they should be on it indefinitely? So this was a real world study where we actually looked at patients who had discontinued anti-coagulation, what you see here in red and those that had continued anti-coagulation. Clearly you can see that those that discontinued initial month period had a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than those who actually had stayed on it. And so that's an important thing to see the efficacy of a medication but the flip side of it is to see the safety. If we're getting benefit but also seeing worsening inside effects, that's not good. So we asked the same question of the same cohort except in a little different way. We asked how many of these actually had major bleeding which of course we see all the time in the intensive care unit when patients are put on blood thinners. And as you can see here, there really wasn't much difference. So this was a boon. This is basically a situation where there's very little risk of continuing the medication. And if you continue the medication, you reduce their chances of getting blood clots. No brainer in this one, we came to the conclusion that continued river rocks ven in this case beyond the initial three to six month treatment period significantly lowered the risk of recurrent thromboembolism without a significant increase in major bleeding compared to the treatment that discontinued at three or six months. And so the key here is that for any medical intervention that you are ever going to do, you have to understand that there's always risk. It would be very surprising to me to hear that perhaps there's never been any kind of side effects in any way, shape, or form to the vaccines. I think that's just preposterous. Any medical intervention that we do, even drinking water to an excess can cause difficulties. So when those side effects happen, they have to be characterized. And I think that's a legitimate thing. And here we're going to talk about a case that was published back in October of 2022 titled a case report, multifocal necrotizing and cephalitis and myocarditis after BNT 162 B2, which is basically the Pfizer mRNA vaccine against COVID-19. This was published recently in just October of last year. It talks about a 76 year old gentleman who had gotten three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Now the first one was actually the AstraZeneca, the Oxford AstraZeneca, which is not an mRNA vaccine, but rather a DNA. This one actually goes into the nucleus. It is a dental viral vaccine chimpanzee specifically. According to this article when they interviewed the family, they said that the patient on day one of that injection actually started to have cardiovascular side effects. This two, which was in July of 2021, so a good two months later, was actually the Pfizer vaccination. And after some time, it doesn't say how long after that, but sometime after that there was behavioral and psychological changes and worsening of the Parkinson's disease. So this patient had already been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease is not only a neurological degradation, it's also a manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction. And it also has cardiovascular effects. So there is a confounder there in the fact that Parkinson's disease is well known to cause cardiovascular issues and neurological issues, of course, and autonomic issues. That's the Schrad-Drager aspect of the Parkinsonian disease. And then finally in December of 2021, so a full five months later, the patient had the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Two weeks after that had collapsed while eating, apparently the patient was continuing to do worse ever since shortly after July. And then again in one week where the patient actually collapsed, it was felt that the patient had had an aspiration pneumonia. That's where the patient cannot control how they swallow, which is actually very common in Parkinson's disease. The food goes down the wrong way and causes pneumonia. And actually that was what was seen on autopsy as we'll talk a little bit. The family was quizzed about this. There was no symptomatic COVID disease. Although the patient does not mention whether or not the patient would actually have retested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. They don't mention it, so I don't believe they probably were. By the way, you can find this article here in this link. You can also search it by title. Let's get into this in a little bit more detail. On the lungs, microscopically, there was cloudy secretions, their perulant spots, brittle perencoma, bilateral, mucopurulent, tracheobronkitis, this all is basically code words in the anatomic pathology and pulmonary discourse for basically pneumonia. Copious perulant secretions. That is what I would see on a bronchoscopy if I was to bronch this patient or put a scope down into the lungs. And this is basically the manifestation of a significant and very bad pneumonia. Which in people who are immunocompromised don't really cause a lot of symptoms. Unfortunately, people who are older and immunocompromised when they get pneumonia, they don't complain of shortness of breath, they don't complain of chest pain. Instead, they become lethargic, sleepy, tired, and pass away. I see this often. So yes, bilateral bronch and pneumonia was known in the lower lungs. There was multiple stages development of low-billing with secretions and fragile perencoma. This is basically what you would see in chronic aspiration. That's exactly what you would see in Parkinson's disease as well. As the patient has difficulty controlling their ability to swallow, things will silently aspirate down into the lungs. No surprise there. But some surprises here as we go along. There was actually quite a lot of findings in the heart. Economic examination revealed manifestations of acute and chronic cardiovascular insufficiency. That just means basically coronary artery disease. There was pulmonary edema. So when the heart doesn't work, the fluid backs up into the brain. Congestion, chronic hepatic congestion. This is one of the organs right behind the heart. Renal tissue edema, but tuatary tissue edema. Evidence of shot, kidney disorder, and so forth and so forth. There was hyper contraction of cardiomyocytes. There was a number of histocytic infiltrates. This just means inflammation, prominent endothelial swelling. This is not what you want to see. And also something called coagulation necrosis as well as fibrin clots. So a lot of damage going on. And what they did was they started to stain the tissues to look for two things specifically. One is the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein. Now why that's important is because of the following. When you have the virus, the virus is made up of spike proteins, which sit on the surface and has been the target of vaccines for antibodies. And then there are the nucleocapsid proteins which are inside, which are not the target of vaccines. And so this is what a virus would look like, a true virus. And the vaccine, of course, is just going to make spike proteins or ask yourselves to make those spike proteins. Nucleocapsids, if they are seen, are basically indicative that the virus is there. And that's the important part with understanding about nucleocapsids. When they stain for spike and when they stain for nucleocapsid, this is a respiratory secretion in a patient who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. This is not the patient that we're talking about who died and is in the autopsy and is part of the paper. This is in the paper, but they're showing you a control that you can stain for this. You can use an antibody, which has the diamino benzadine marker on it. And that's what you're seeing here with this brown. So what you're seeing here is antibodies against the spike protein. So we're seeing spike in respiratory secretions in a patient who is positive for SARS-CoV-2. In those same respiratory secretions, we're staining for nucleocapsid proteins. These are in the respiratory epithelial cells in the respiratory secretions. That's primarily where the infection is taking place. So that's important to understand. This is the control that they're doing in this situation. Now let's go back to the patient that died and was getting the autopsy. So when they looked at the patient's brain, they did the same sort of staining. Here, they're looking for the presence of spike protein in the brain of the deceased patient, who they never tested for SARS-CoV-2. But what did they find? As you remember, he was vaccinated three times. And the purpose of those three vaccinations is to make spike protein. And what are they seeing here? They're seeing spike protein here in the brain. So this is lighting up on this immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit one. When they do the same thing for the nucleocapsid protein, it's crickets. They don't see anything. There's no staining whatsoever in the brain. Why is there no nucleocapsid protein? That is up for discussion, but there isn't any, as we can see here, on this page. Let's go to another specimen from the same patient, also brain. Again, we're looking for the presence of spike. And as you can see here, there is spike protein, spike protein. This blue arrow, by the way, is not spike protein. It is actually an individual glial cell. So just ignore that. That is not spike protein immunohistochemical staining. Again, brain deceased. They're looking for nucleocapsid protein. And again, we don't see anything. There's no nucleocapsid protein staining. All right, let's keep going. Now let's look at the heart in the same deceased patient. We're looking for spike protein. And we see, again, spike protein staining on immunohistochemical staining. We look for nucleocapsid protein. And once again, we do not see any nucleocapsid protein in that individual. So what did this lead the author of this paper that was published in October to say, well, first of all, on the autopsy, the final diagnosis was, this is the official death diagnosis after the autopsy, bilateral bronchonamonia, undeniable, because the patient was probably silently aspirating, Parkinson's disease, necrotic encephalitis, based on what they saw, and myocarditis as well. Now let's see what the author says. They say, immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which is the spike protein and the nucleocapsid, revealed that the lesions with necrotic encephalitis, that means dying part of the brain inflammation, as well as acute inflammatory changes in the small blood vessels in the brain and heart were associated with abundant deposits of spike protein subunit one. Since the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 was consistently absent, it must be assumed that the presence of spike protein in affected tissues was not due to an infection of SARS-CoV-2, but rather to the transfection of tissues by the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines. The reason why they can safely say that this was not an infection from SARS-CoV-2 is because there was no nucleocapsid protein seen on the autopsy. They go on. Importantly, spike protein could be only demonstrated in the areas with acute inflammatory reactions, brain heart and small blood vessels, and in particular the endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes. This is strongly suggested that the spike protein may have played at least a contributing role to the development of the lesions and the course of the disease in the patient. They go on based on the alteration pattern in the brain and heart. It appeared that the small blood vessels were especially affected in particular the endothelium, and the phyloid dysfunction is known to be highly involved in organ dysfunction during viral infections. He does mention that this can happen in viral infections as it induces a procoagulant state, microvascular leak, and organ ischemia. This is also the case for SARS-CoV-2 infections. So in other words, this is looking like a SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, he's not calling the SARS-CoV-2 infection because there's no nucleocapsid proteins in the extra respiratory tissues. They say here we're a systemic exposure to the virus and the spike protein that listens to a strong immunological reaction in which the endothelial cells play a crucial role leading to vascular dysfunction, immunothermbrosis, and inflammation. And those of you who know us at MEGCRAM, we've talked extensively about this and how oxidative stress in the endothelial cells can lead to damage releasing on Von Willibrand's fracture, which causes these small microclots in the circulation of the lungs and causing hypoxia. That's probably what leads to happy hypoxics. He goes on, although there was no history of COVID-19 for this patient, immunochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 antigens was performed. Spike protein could indeed be demonstrated in the years of acute inflammation of the brain, particularly within the capoid endothelium, and the small blood vessels of the heart. Parcably, however, the nucleocapsid was uniformly absent. During the infection with the virus, both proteins should be expressed and detected together, he says. It doesn't give a reference for that interestingly, but it makes logical sense. On the other hand, the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines encode only the spike protein and therefore the presence of spike protein only, but no nucleocapsid protein in the heart and brain on the current case can be treated to vaccination rather to infection. This agrees with the patient's history, which includes three vaccine injections. The first one was a DNA, the last two were RNA, and the third one just three weeks before is death, but no positive laboratory clinical diagnosis of the infection. It doesn't sound like the patient actually had a COVID-19 test, which could be asymptomatic. So the conclusion was numerous cases of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis have been reported in connection with the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines, with many being considered causally related to vaccination. However, this is the first report to demonstrate the presence of the spike protein actually in these encephalytic lesions and to attribute it to vaccination rather than infection. These findings corroborate the causative role of gene-based COVID-19 vaccines, and this diagnostic approach is relevant to potentially vaccine-induced damage to other organs as well. He's making the point here that the absence of the nucleocapsid is the cyniquanone to speak the Latin, that this is definitely vaccination. That's this with this paper. This is a paper that was published in the annals of diagnostic pathology. It's original contribution. Notice here that this was available online, even though it was published in October around the same time as the other paper. The results of this paper were available since May of last year. Let's find out what this paper says. They say here, cardiac manifestations are common in severe COVID-19. So these are looking at COVID-19 deaths. These are deaths that are attributed to COVID-19, and they're looking actually at 11 of these, and 11 controls. What they're able to do is something called insight to hybridization, which is a way of measuring RNA samples. They're also using exactly the same technique that they used in the first paper, which is immunochistochemistry for viral proteins. What did they do? They looked for ACE2 expression, which we're not going to get into because that's not really the purpose of this. They did see that ACE2 expression was 10 times greater than the heart tissues of cases and controls with obesity or type 2 diabetes. That's really interesting. What they found is these are COVID-19 cases that died, and what they found starting right here is interesting. However, in each case, abundant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was evident. But SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein were rarely detected in situ in any COVID-19 heart. Let me repeat that again here. These are known to have COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2. Even in these cases, in non-respiratory tissue, whereas they found plenty of spike protein, they did not find nucleocapsid protein as well. What they conclude though is that the viral spike protein is endocytized by macrophages in the lung and are carried to the heart and the brain and other organs. That's the reason why you're seeing the spike protein and not the nucleocapsid. Let's take a look at some of the data here. Here is what's called a western blot from proteins extracted either from the nasopharynx, which is NP, that's part of the respiratory, where you'll see a lot of nucleocapsid in spike with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 or a positive result. So here's the nasopharynx, it's negative, and you can see here we don't see any proteins. Here's the nasopharynx with someone with a very high copy count of SARS-CoV-2. What you see here is you see this band and you see this band. This blue band at the top is the spike protein. And this brown band down here is the nucleocapsid protein. Notice that when you look at the nasopharynx and you have low copy count, you can see still the spike protein, but this nasopharyngeal sample of nucleocapsid protein is almost nonexistent, which means that even in respiratory tissue, where there's a high copy count, you might not pick up nucleocapsid protein, even if you are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Let's move on to the nucleocapsid protein specifically. So here we have nucleocapsid protein, and this is the band that you want to look at, because that is the nucleocapsid protein. These are COVID lungs. COVID lung one, COVID lung two. Notice in normal lung, we do not see that nucleocapsid protein. By the way, these are just reference lines. Let's take a look at these COVID organs. We have COVID liver organ one. There is no band. We look in the brain in this COVID patient. No band. COVID CNS one. No band. How about the spleen in COVID? No band. Of course, in the normal CNS, there's no band either. They said their nucleocapsid protein is only evident in lung samples, and nasal pharynx, that's respiratory, that's where it divides, and it's not found in any of the other organs tested. What about spike? Maybe it's just not there. Maybe the spike isn't there either. Maybe it just didn't go. It was a mild infection. No, because most of the COVID-19 heart samples show the band that analyzed for viral spike. So where's the spike protein? This is spike. This is spike. So in the lung, we see spike. In the heart, we see a light spike. In this heart, we see a light spike. In this heart, we see a light spike. In this COVID heart, too, we see a light spike. Pre-COVID heart? No spike. Spike can go to extra respiratory organs, but we have not seen an example here where the nucleocapsid goes to extra respiratory organs in SARS-CoV-2. They say here, quote, interestingly, only the COVID-19 lung and nasal pharynxial samples showed a signal for the nucleocapsid protein. Specifically, zero out of 11 cardiac cases were positive for the nucleocapsid protein, whereas seven out of 11 were positive for the viral spike and the envelope proteins. They did not show that data in this, but that's what they showed. Now let's take a look at the immunohistochemical staining, which is what they did in that first study. And let's see what we see here. We see lung. Do we see nucleocapsid? Absolutely. We see nucleocapsid in the same way that we would normally see it. But do we see heart spike? Yes, these little pink things are heart spike. Well, if we're seeing heart spike, we should also see heart nucleocapsid, right? Because this is a viral infection. We always see crickets here. We see nothing. There is no nucleocapsid in viral infections. So what do they say? They say the source of the endogenous spike protein in severe COVID-19 would likely be the extremely high-copy viral load seen in the lungs of these patients. They're saying here that in the lungs of patients, this is where the virus is replicating so much that you're going to be able to see both spike and nucleocapsid. Virus in the lung induces a micro angiopathy that causes viral degeneration and is a logical source of viral spike proteins entering the circulation. This is exactly what we've been talking about and docking in organs with a high perivascular bed and ACE2 population. That would be hearts. Preliminary data suggests that the viral spike protein alone with the matrix and envelope proteins are carried by macrophages in the circulation. This could explain in many studies which have shown that the viral spike protein per say or more accurately, the S1 subunit, the spike protein, which has the RBD sequence for ACE2 can demonstrate cytotoxic effects. You may never see the nucleocapsid going to distant organs that are non-respatory because it's the spike that gets picked up by the macrophages and not the nucleocapsid. Remember, when we go back to that first study, remember there was a control. Here we saw spike in the respiratory secretions. Here we saw nucleocapsid in the respiratory secretions. We never saw this for non-respatory secretions. Remember that the author of the first study says, since the nucleocapsid protein in SARS-CoV-2 was consistently absent, it must be assumed that the presence of spike protein in affected tissues was not due to infection. I'm not sure if that is a logical assumption anymore based on the data that we have now and that was actually available at the time of publication even back as far as May of 2022. It seems very likely, in fact, that you're not going to pick up the presence of nucleocapsid proteins in non-respatory organs of the body in patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Let's go back to our case study. Again, I would be very surprised if there wasn't a single case out there or multiple cases, and where there has been significance, injury, or even death from an intervention. I see this all the time. In my intensive care unit, I have patients that come in with head bleeds because they're on anti-coagulation, and clearly is a result of the anti-coagulation that they're on. But the hope was that that anti-coagulation would prevent a stroke. Indeed, we know that every year, thousands and thousands of strokes are prevented because people are put on blood thinners. But we also get maybe a few, tens, twenties, thirties of people who have head bleeds. We look at that risk benefit. So I think it's important to continue to look for these things. But we also have to look at the data and make the analysis here to see whether or not in fact this is going on. This is what I've done, looking at data and actually telling you things that could falsify my interpretation conclusions. In this situation, the patient had a mRNA vaccine dose three, and it was two weeks later that the patient collapsed, and then one week later the patient died. So three weeks after this, basically this mRNA Pfizer vaccine was given. So the question is, is this is actually happening? We should see a signal after people have been vaccinated. So I go again to the graph of vaccination versus excess deaths. Here up on the top, we see daily SARS-CoV-2 infections during the beginning of the pandemic. We have the first wave. This is a scale going to 1 million. You can see here the first wave was about 300,000, and this Delta wave here again was probably maybe 250,000. This was up here almost a million. We didn't catch all of these people. Some of them weren't tested, but we tested as many as we could, and we can kind of get relative looks at these things. Down here we have excess mortality. So this is anybody who died. And the thing I like about excess mortality, not none, COVID mortality. So it doesn't matter what's put on the death certificate. Whatever's on the death certificate is on the death certificate. All you need is a death certificate and a date, and it goes in here. So it doesn't matter if the patient is misdiagnosed as having COVID or not having COVID, or they died of encephalitis, and they didn't think it was from COVID. It's all going in here. It's all being captured. Notice here that the same pattern of SARS-CoV-2 matches the same pattern here of this excess wave happening exactly at the time that it should happen maybe two to three weeks after it. We have the same thing here with the Delta wave, and we see again here because that Delta wave was just so virulent, we see it exactly popping up two weeks later because it takes about two weeks for people to die once they get infected from SARS-CoV-2. The Omicron wave once again. So we see here that the peaks completely line up. Superimposed on top of that and reversed for ease of looking at here is the number of vaccinations, whereas we had about 300,000 SARS-CoV-2 cases. Here in a single day we vaccinated three and a half million people. Number ten times the number of people got a spike protein from the vaccine, then the people that got a spike protein from the first wave of SARS-CoV-2. And so if this is what we're seeing as a result of excess deaths from the first wave, we should see something approximately three weeks later, down approximately right here as a result of vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. I'm not saying that it doesn't happen, as I said, it would be very surprised if there was absolutely no risk associated with an intervention. There's risk associated with every intervention. But what I am saying is that whatever the magnitude of that risk is has to fit underneath this curve at that point. If we're talking about an immediate effect from SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. If this were happening, I would have expected, depending on the magnitude, I would have expected something to look like this. You know, it would be a little bit delayed or I would have expected something to look like this or if it was less in magnitude or even less in magnitude. Something that would look like that when this is the number of and I have it upside down here, right? So that's the peak. This here is the peak of all vaccinations in the United States. We vaccinated one day on this day, three and a half million people. It doesn't mean that there's not long-term effects, but I'm not seeing an acute association here at least on this curve. Going back to the publication that I was involved with, we have to realize that there is always going to be side effects. And we can see that here that as time goes on, regardless of if you were on the anti-coagulation or not on the anti-coagulation, there are going to be people who have major bleeding events. But the key to understanding whether or not and how you can prevent those is not to compare somebody who would never have an event with someone who did have an event. You have to compare someone who did have an event with someone who didn't get the intervention. And that's where it's important to be able to look at things epidemiologically and with studies and with data. The other thing that this shows is that sometimes things may seem logical, but this is the reason we press for evidence-based medicine. Even though something may seem logical or it may seem like it makes sense, like in this case, it would seem logical that if you see the spike protein without the nucleocapsid that it would make sense that since the vaccine only makes the spike protein without the nucleocapsid, this would implicate the vaccine. However, there could be other factors that are preventing that nucleocapsid protein from getting out of the respiratory tissue and into non-respiratory tissue organs. The second paper highlights that even though this thing made sense, it may not be the case. And with that, my condolences to all of these people that had perished from one reason or another that were used in these studies and with the families as well, I know all too well the impacts here. We talk about statistics and numbers, but each one of these people have families, loved ones, and again, my condolences. I am a frontline doctor that works in the intensive care unit, so I understand the actual reality of all of these issues. And with that, this concludes.

"Harris on taking a COVID vaccine: If Trump tells us to take it, I won't",CBS News,2020-10-07,40eZeXPyJ0g,"For life to get back to normal, Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated. But half of Americans now say they wouldn't take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump administration approves a vaccine before or after the election, should Americans take it and would you take it? If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it."
Covid Vaccines: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO),LastWeekTonight,2021-05-02,gPHgRp70H8o,"But we are actually in a dive straight in with our main story tonight, which concerns the Covid vaccines. The end result of the world's greatest scientists working around the clock to save countless lives immortalized in a card will all definitely lose in a month, vitally important but also too big to fit in any standard wallet, way to fumble at the one-yard line science. And look, not that we needed it, but this week saw yet another reminder of just how dangerous Covid is with cases in India in particular, surging at a truly terrifying rate. India set a world record for daily Covid cases of over 400,000 and that is probably an undercount. And obviously, the world should be doing everything it can to help India right now. But our best way out of this mess long term is clearly vaccines. And it's worth remembering, we in the US are incredibly fortunate. We currently have access to a lot of vaccines and more than half of US adults have now gotten at least one dose, which is great. The back uses some vaccination locations have already gone from having not enough supply to not enough demand. According to the CDC, the daily average for vaccinations has dropped 20 percent since the start of the month, a worrying trend. Vaccine demand declining in South Carolina, some providers left with extra doses and appointments for wide open. Palm Beach County health care district says it is now facing 10,000 appointments for the county's vaccine sites remain unfilled since they opened this week. Appointments are going unfilled. We've got thousands of appointments available over the next few weeks and no takers at this point. It's true. A worrying amount of people are holding off on getting the free Covid vaccine. And I'm not saying that you should immediately get something just because it's free. I wouldn't recommend getting these old dolls on Craigslist just because they're free, they're weird, broken and they will kill you in your sleep. But these vaccines could say not just your life, but the lives of people around you. And it's genuinely disparity. For just a few months into the vaccine rollout, we are already at this point. And the problem is, for the coronavirus, the herd immunity threshold is thought to be between 70 and 90 percent of the population. But a survey found that while 60 percent of American adults have got or want to get the vaccine, another 18 percent say maybe and 22 percent say no. And if you think it will hold on, if every maybe gets the vaccine, that still puts us at 78 percent. Unfortunately, that poll doesn't take into account children who we're not vaccinating right now and who make up around 22 percent of the population. So we need to get the vaccine into as many adults as possible as soon as possible. And that means you really need to get vaccinated. And obviously, I mean the collective you, but also you, Mike, Mike in Baltimore. I know you've got this on in the background at work on Monday. So listen to me, schedule your vaccine, Mike. Don't say you're going to look into it later. Just Google vaccine find a Baltimore. It takes seconds. Here are a list of vaccine sites in your area. And if you're thinking, yeah, I'm not sure I need it. Joe Rogan says I'm probably fine. Look, it is true. You might not get seriously sick from COVID or indeed sick at all, but you could still inadvertently pass it to someone who could then die. And before you say, well, vulnerable people should just get vaccinated then the vaccines are only 95 percent effective, Mike. So they'll probably be okay, but maybe not. Also, the more the virus circulates, the likely will see mutations that make it more dangerous, possibly helping it to evade the vaccine completely, putting us all the way back to square one. So get the fucking vaccine, Mike. The point is there is a problematic amount of vaccine hesitancy right now, even among people who you would really like to think would not need convincing. We met Robert Ganon before he went into visit his 77 year old mother Kia, who was on a ventilator right now in the ICU due to COVID. Had she been vaccinated, she was not vaccinated. I think she'd be in hesitant, just wanting to see how things played out. Have you been vaccinated? I have not. What would it take for you to get vaccinated? I'd want to make sure that it's safe. Wow. There is perhaps no clear sign of just how deep vaccine hesitancy runs than someone in that guy's position, still questioning whether to get it. Instead of asking, is there such a thing as too much vaccine? Because if not, I'm going to keep going back for injections until I'm around 80 percent Pfizer. So given all of that tonight, let's talk about the COVID vaccines. Why people are hesitant, what their worries are, and how they might be reassured. And let's start with the fact you can't characterize any one group as uniformly vaccine hesitant. No demographic is a monolith. Every group will have some who are excited and others who are anxious and different groups will be anxious for different reasons. For instance, early on, you've probably heard a lot about hesitancy among some black Americans, which can be a real thing. Even this pediatrician had reservations. When the vaccine was first made available to both of you, did you both jump at the chance to get it? No, no, I mean, not me anyway. I am black first in this country, and that has with it a lot of baggage to tell you the truth. And so, to my public health degree, the culminating experience that I did was related to the relationship between black people and physicians. And that relationship has been a contancurist one. And so those are the kinds of things that are deeply embedded and challenging to overcome, even within someone who's a scientist. Honestly, I do understand that. We've talked before on this show about the fraught relationship black Americans have with healthcare, based on both current bad experiences and the history of incidents like the Tuskegee experiment where doctors lied to black men, allowing them to suffer from untreated syphilis over decades. Or, as most US history students would describe it, something I have not heard of. Although it does feel important to mention that that doctor did wind up getting the vaccine, and in general, black vaccine hesitancy has dropped fast. Another group you might have heard have high hesitancy rates are Republicans, and that is also true. Around 30 percent of Republicans say they won't get it, and it's not hard to see why. Because fears and doubts about the vaccine have flown around conservative media, with one of the most prominent super spreaders being this fucking guy. What about this vaccine? Why are Americans being discouraged from asking simple straightforward questions about it? Questions like, how effective are these drugs? Are they safe? Do you need a reason to turn on the vaccine? And what happens if you do turn it down? We'd be allowed to fly on airplanes, or go to work, or enter the front doors of Madison Square Garden? Oh, now they're telling us the vaccine has a delayed response. Okay, delayed by how long? They don't say. If vaccines work, why are vaccinated people still banned from living normal lives? Honestly, what's the answer to that? So maybe it doesn't work, and they're simply not telling you that. Well, you hate to think that, especially if you've gotten two shots. But what's the other potential explanation? Okay, it is genuinely weird to see someone hosting a show on a supposed news network and ending every sentence with a question mark, especially when answers to most of those questions are out there for anyone who cares to know. So, for instance, that last complaint that the CDC still recommends wearing masks indoors when around vulnerable, unvaccinated people does not mean the vaccine doesn't work. Clinical trials found that the vaccines are spectacularly successful at preventing people from getting serious disease. As for whether they protect you from spreading the virus, the trials weren't designed to assess that, but evident so far indicates that they drastically reduce transmission. The reason we still see mask and distancing recommendations is that the CDC is being cautious, and wants to be sure that it is not spreading bushes around during a global pandemic, like a frozen dinner jukes with a TV show. Anyway, I hope that answers at least one of your gapemouth bad faith-wandering's tucker, you scrunched faced fear baboon. And the problem is, when people like tucker raise questions without bothering to answer them, there is a lot of misinformation out there for people to then stumble on. Anti-vaccine groups have been waiting for a moment like this to spread out, and the scary thing is they don't actually need to convince people they're right. They just need to convince people that no one is, and that tracks with recent polling. While few believe specific myths about the vaccine, larger numbers say that they didn't know whether particular myths were true or false. For instance, only 4 percent of people believe the COVID vaccine is more deadly than the disease, but 25 percent say they don't know, and that is not good, because if anti-vaccine groups can simply spread enough misinformation to cause people to throw up their hands and say, I just don't know enough to get the shot. They have already seriously fucked things up for all of us, and to be clear, most people who are hesitant are not fanatics or conspiracy theorists. Many are just trying to make the best decision for themselves and their family, like that pediatrician that we saw earlier. You definitely know people like that in your life. So I'm actually going to spend the rest of this piece trying to clear up some of the biggest myths flying around, and some are pretty easy to debunk quickly, like the claims that Bill Gates is using the vaccine to put a microchip in all of us. Something his wife had this response to. I know my husband is not vaccinating people and putting a microchip in her arm, because that technology doesn't even exist, and he's never uttered the words out of his mouth, so... Okay, that wasn't the reassuring pushback to a batshit conspiracy theory that I had hoped for to be honest. We're not microchipping people because the technology doesn't exist yet, and my husband hasn't said it out loud to me. Why would you put it like that? There are lots of things a husband won't say out loud to his wife, not dark things, just things. Quiet thoughts apart and might not be ready to hear. Like how sometimes late at night, I think, wouldn't it be nice to live in an egg? An egg to be. Not just an oval shaped sleeping pot. I can get an oval shaped sleeping pot. Nobody wants one of those. I mean an egg. A big egg with me in it, or maybe a normal egg, and I'm small, it doesn't matter. What matters is I'm in an egg. Not alone, I'm with the gloop too. It's just me and the gloop. No opening, no windows, no way to ever know if it's morning or night, so you know what time it is? All the time? Egg time. Just egg time for me and the gloop. Sometimes it's warm, and that's when I feel safest. Sometimes I can tell I'm being carried or moved about, and it's jarring enough that I'm nervous, but not so rough and I'm panicking. And you can shake me, but do make sure not to do it hard, because remember, I'm fragile. I am egg. The point is you can't say any of that to Melinda Gates, you'd never understand what wife could. Anyway, for the record, there are no microchips in the COVID vaccine. That rumor is based on the fact that the Gates Foundation funded research years ago, which is frequently taken out of context. In that study, researchers looked into creating an invisible ink that could potentially be injected along with a vaccine in order for populations like refugee kids to be able to retain vaccine records without paperwork. Over time, the original context was lost, contorted, and kind of telephoned its way to becoming something, something Bill Gates microchips on Facebook, a claim which if you think about it for just a second doesn't make sense, because if your main concern is that Bill Gates could use microchips to track you, he can already do that. That's what your fucking phone is. Now, another more reasonable sounding concern has to do with just how fast the vaccine came together. One, one to get it. I feel like it was too rushed. I think the whole thing has been rushed through too fast. It kind of came really fast, like the vaccine. They made up one really fast. It was done way too quick. I just, I don't feel comfortable with taking it, not anytime soon. I think that they're using the public as guinea pigs. Right, and that doesn't sound good. Nobody wants to be a guinea pig, although I don't really know why. Being a guinea pig seems great. You can eat a pepper while wearing the stem as a little hat, run around a tiny city made of cardboard and best of all, you get to use the guinea pig bridge. Yeah, being a guinea pig has its upsides. That's all I'm saying. The infrastructure alone is incredible, but that is clearly not the concern that those people have. Their worry is that we are being used as guinea pigs for a rushed, untested vaccine. It is an understandable thing to worry about, even if some express it in less than ideal ways. Tell me why you're concerned. Six words, testing, testing, testing, testing, and more testing. It's important if you're going to put something into your body that it's absolutely and totally tested. I tell you what I admire about that guy. He's confidence because I don't think I've seen anyone more self assured than the man who just promised six words, said seven and counted five, all without even flinching. That guy is so secure it is thinking. He can be wrong about numbers on camera twice and do it with an unbreaking smile. But it is worth understanding exactly how the vaccine was able to come to market so fast because research has had been working on vaccines against other coronaviruses for years. So when COVID-19 hit, they had a significant head start. Operation warp speed, as it was famously called, wasn't about rushing the science. It was about significantly cutting through bureaucracy that could have otherwise slowed it down. As this vaccine researcher explains, Did you ever imagine that we'd be able to develop a vaccine in 12 to 18 months? The short answer is no. We're able to compress the timeline so that things that we would normally do in a linear fashion. A to B, we actually start the F and E at the same time as NB. Exactly. They took steps that usually happened sequentially and save time by running them simultaneously. And to be honest, I am envious of that level of efficiency. I would save so much time every morning. If I could shit shower, shave, eat breakfast, kiss my family and brush my teeth, all at the same time. Unfortunately, I've only ever managed to do three of them at once, but I'm so close to that fourth one. Now, another concern that you may have heard or seen online is that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the first authorized to use messenger RNA, which is true. But that has given rise to speculation about what mRNA is capable of doing. Basically, anyone taking these vaccines, they're all designed to the same thing. It's going to have neurological disorders within one year. Most of the people taking the vaccine will be dead within 10. Let me tell you something. You take the mRNA, it creates plaque in your brain, it gives you Alzheimer's, and I got the studies too. So, hey, you think they just put flour out of the water to dump you down? Man, Alex Jones is having a blast, isn't he? No one else has as much fun while making the world a worse place to live it. It's like he invented a jetpack that sprays everyone beneath him with human shit. But the thing is, there is absolutely no evidence or credible studies supporting any of what he just said. As for the claim that mRNA vaccines modify your DNA, it is very important to know that the vaccines mRNA does not enter our genome. It does its work far from the cells nucleus, which is where your DNA is. But the fear of what the vaccine contains or what it could do to you seems to be common. Some evangelicals are concerned that it contains cells from aborted fetuses, which it does not. Others worry that it could change the bodies in a workings. You might have had a friend tell you that they are worried that the vaccines cause infertility. Those rumors were fueled by a blog post which fostered claim that Pfizer's vaccine contained ingredients capable of training the female body to attack a protein that plays a crucial role in the development of the placenta. But a few things there. First, experts say of that claim it's a myth, it's inaccurate, there is no evidence to support it. And there is already pretty good proof that Pfizer's vaccine doesn't cause infertility because during the trials last year multiple women became pregnant and the only one who suffered a pregnancy loss was given the placebo. So it is just not true. And look, the final myth you may have heard is that the risks from the vaccine are somehow greater than the risks of COVID. That is a perception fed by the constant circulation of misleading headlines about people falling ill or dying after getting their shot. For instance, you may have seen this story that was widely shared about 23 people in Norway dying within a week of getting the shot, which does sound scary. But that headline is missing some pretty major context while those people did die. At that point in Norway, the vaccine was being administered to the oldest or sickest people and a certain percentage of them were statistically going to die that week, vaccine or no vaccine. On average, 400 people die every week in nursing homes in Norway. And when the World Health Organization reviewed those incidents, they didn't find any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities, which does make sense. Correlation isn't causation. The vaccine protects against COVID, not the concept of mortality. It is weird that I have to clarify this, but you are, in fact, going to die one day. Mike, yeah, Mike, stop listening to what Joe Rogan tells you. He's a fucking moron. And those are his words, not mine. That also goes for stories that you might see, hyping up scary sounding data from VAERS, the vaccine adverse event reporting system. It's a database that collects stories of medical events following vaccinations. But any layperson has to treat data coming out of it with extreme caution, because reports can be entered by anyone and are not routinely verified. One doctor once claimed that the flu vaccine turned into the Hulk, and that report was accepted and entered into the database, which is completely absurd. A drug cannot turn you into the Hulk. Although admittedly, it can turn you into Captain America, the only superhero whose origin story is a metric ton of experimental Nazi steroids. And look, if we're just going to share random unverified side effects, I might as well show you this truly shocking video about what might happen to your mom. So my mom got the vaccine because she's a healthcare worker and she told me she's experiencing some side effects. Mom, what's that side effect you said you're experiencing? They're in a boss ass bitch. Very good. And look, I'm not saying VAERS is useless. It very much isn't. The reason the CDC collects this data is so if a patent does emerge, actions can be taken. That is exactly what happened with the Johnson & Johnson shot. The CDC found a potential pattern of rare blood clots and paused the rollout under an abundance of caution. And while some vaccine skeptics pointed to that as evidence that they were right about vaccines being dangerous, in reality, it kind of proves the opposite. But the safety risk of vaccines is rigorously and publicly analyzed, not secretly buried and somehow leaked to the human footballs neon scream hour. And none of this is to say that there are no side effects to the vaccines. There can be. It is just that serious ones like anaphylaxis are incredibly rare. 4.7 cases per million for Pfizer, two and a half cases per million for Moderna. And you should know, those also occur mostly in individuals with a history of severe allergies. The fact is, the vast majority of people can expect at most typical cold or flu symptoms in the first few days after their shot or maybe just a sore arm or maybe nothing at all. For what it's worth, I actually got my second shot this Thursday, my arm had a little bit for a day, but that's basically it. I will admit the following afternoon for a couple of hours, I did feel a little bit like a boss ass bitch, but that passed quickly. And anyway, the key thing to remember is that no side effect of the vaccine is worse than the alternative, Covid. A disease that has killed over 500,000 people in the US alone, while once again, to date, the vaccine has been proven to kill exactly zero. So it is more than natural to have questions, but there are reassuring answers out there. And anyone just throwing out questions without acknowledging that probably has another agenda entirely. But the problem is to get anywhere close to herd immunity. We badly need to convince anyone who can be convinced. So the question is, how do we do that? Well, some Republican lawmakers, to their credit, have tried to reassure their voters, although occasionally, those attempts have looked like this. Live free and beauty surrounds you. The world still astounds you each time you look at a star. I'm certain to join Kennedy. I can't sing very well, but I'm free. Be free. Be cool. Get the vaccine. I did. It works. Okay, I don't love that. And not just because it is the worst thing to come out of a Kennedy's mouth since the back of a Kennedy's head, but also because the truth is that probably didn't convince anyone. In researching this piece, experts repeatedly told us that the vaccine hesitant generally don't respond well to hearing from politicians, celebrities or athletes telling them to get the vaccine. And I get that. I would love to think that I could end this piece having carefully laid out some data with a triumphant call for people to get vaccinated, featuring a mascot of some in Congress animal like, I don't know, a vaccine cicada. You don't think that that's something that I would be interested in doing? The truth is, we actually did that. We had a vaccine cicada costume made. But after being advised that this technique would not be remotely effective in convincing people who were hesitant, we scrapped the idea completely. We emailed our mascot guy and we told him not to come in because it was an absolutely stupid idea. A vaccine cicada? Can you imagine how done that would look? It probably wouldn't even look like a cicada, more like some kind of unhinged cockroach. It was a terrible concept that could have fundamentally undermined the very important message that we were trying to send. And I am so, so glad that we avoided making that mistake. Because the truth is, I'm not going to be able to convince the people in your life who are hesitant. The person with the best chance of doing that is you. So if you know someone who is worried for whatever reason and you want to convince them otherwise, don't show them this video. But maybe do try and use some of the information inside it to tell them yourself. And when you are trying to do that, don't dismiss or judge them for having doubts. And I know that that is not always easy. I could have given that guy a pass for holding up the wrong number of fingers, but I couldn't do it. I don't have that level of restraint. I'm a small petty man and that guy is a fucking idiot. But if you think you can do better, it is incredibly important that you try. Or to put in the terms that that guy could understand, I've got two words for you. Please just try as hard as you can."
Woman Dies 4 days after getting COVID Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths,Doctor Mike Hansen,2021-04-21,wosyaWiDR2U,"Cassidy Curl, a 39-year-old single mom. Her family describes her as healthy, happy, and having more energy than most. She had no known health problems. Unless you count tri-gemonal neurology, she took Botox for that. She also took birth control. She worked as a surgical tech for local plastic surgeons. She gets the Moderna COVID vaccine. Her first shot goes without incident, other than a sore arm. Second dose, not so much. She gets her second shot on February 1st, which is a Monday. Later that evening, she has a sore arm, nausea, and fever. That's not unheard of after someone gets the vaccine. Some people get a sore arm, fatigue, body aches, slight fever, and chills, especially after the second shot, and especially in younger people. Now, when this happens, people can take Tylenol or ibuprofen, no big deal, right? Unless they take too much. She did take Tylenol, aka acetaminophen, but we don't know how much. She felt a little better the next day, but by Wednesday, she's not able to pee despite drinking lots of fluids. She says it's the worst she ever felt. Thursday morning, 6 a.m., she tells her parents she needs to go to the hospital. In the ER, she immediately starts throwing up. Blood tests come back, and doctors say she was very, very sick, and her liver was not functioning. Blood tests show that her liver is not working. This entails severe elevations of her AST and ALT enzymes. This also means an elevated INR. So what is going on here? This is acute liver failure, aka Fulminate hepatic failure, or Fulminate hepatitis. The doctors give her IV fluids. They also give her a drug to counteract the effects of Tylenol on the liver. It's called NAC, or N-acetylcystine. But the damage was already done. Around this time, she becomes incoherent, and this is because acute liver failure causes the brain to swell, called cerebral edema. If it's severe enough, it can result in coma. At this point, your only chance of survival is with a liver transplant. So she was flown to a transplant hospital, but when the liver completely fails, it causes other organs to follow suit, especially the kidneys in brain and soon after the heart and the lungs. She's put on full life support, including a breathing tube. Even if there was a match for a new liver, she's too unstable to undergo the operation. She dies, about 30 hours after she first arrived at the ER. She leaves behind a young daughter who wants people to hear her story. And if you want to contribute to her GoFundMe page, I'm putting a link below this video. A lot of people will conclude that the vaccine caused her death, but timing by itself does not prove causation. And a lot of people want to know, did the vaccine cause her death? And if not, then what caused it? A Utah medical examiner completed a full autopsy, but the results remained private. The medical examiner said the autopsy did not show a link between vaccine and death, which is hardly surprising. If a vaccine caused someone to die, surely after receiving it, how would it do so? The only medical explanation would be an immunological reaction, meaning an allergic reaction. So far in the US, there have been over 200 million doses of the vaccine given. No one has died from a severe allergic reaction as a result of the COVID vaccine. And in her case, it's obvious that she did not have an allergic reaction. For example, there was not swelling in the face or the tongue or tightening of the throat. Deaths after COVID-19 vaccinations are reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system. Between December 14th and middle of March, there have been over 109 million vaccine doses in that time frame in the United States. Now of those, there have been less than 2,000 reports of death on the VAIR system, which is 0.0018 percent. A reported death in the VAIR system doesn't mean the vaccine caused it. If someone dies of a car accident on the way home, after they get the vaccine, what was the cause of death? So the big question in Cassidy's case is what caused her acute liver failure? In the US, a seat of minifin accounts for 40 percent of cases. In 18 percent of cases, there is no identifiable cause. 13 percent are due to idiosyncratic drug reactions, meaning medications other than talonol. The general recommended dose for a seat of minifin in healthy people is no more than 4 grams per day. Sometimes people end up taking more than they should. Sometimes it's intentional overdose, sometimes it's accidental overdose. Regardless, this accounts for almost half of the cases of a seat of minifin induced acute liver failure. A seat of minifin toxicity, it presents in three phases. The first phase involves nausea and vomiting in the first 24 hours. In the second phase, during hours 24 to 72, there's a dramatic rise in liver enzymes seen on the blood work. Elevated AST in ALT, in high AST to ALT ratio. During this phase, a seat of minifin causes kidney damage as well. The third phase, our 72 through 96, consists of encephalopathy. Here, the brain is not working right because it's swollen. There's confusion or a lethargy. This often progresses to coma. There's usually a jaundice at this point as well. The treatment for acetaminophen toxicity is a drug called an acetylcystine. NAC can be life-saving. The sooner it's given, the better the outcome. If it's given within 10 hours of ingestion, there's a 95 percent chance of survival. A seat of minifin levels can be checked in the blood work. Increased levels help make the diagnosis, but even if they're normal, it doesn't rule out the possibility of toxicity. Why? Because it's possible that the liver already metabolized the acetaminophen. In fact, it's not the actual acetaminophen that destroys the liver. Instead, it's one of its breakdown products. It's a metabolite called NAPQI, which turns the liver into mush. Here's a picture of what I'm talking about. This is liver necrosis. And this is what a healthy liver looks like. When you look at it underneath the microscope, this is what you get. NAPQI, it also damages the kidney, and when the kidneys aren't working, people stop peeing. This is why it's so important that people make sure they're not taking too much acetaminophen. This drug is often combined with other drugs, and toxic levels can sneak up on people. For example, over-the-counter cough medications, percassette, vikin, they all have a acetaminophen in them. Medicine is complex. It always comes down to risk versus benefit, whether that be Tylenol or other medications, the risks of the virus versus the vaccine. That's why it's important to stay in the know. Thanks for watching."
Covid vaccine and road accidents,Dr. John Campbell,2022-12-17,YAl7jHHuG9E,"Well, one welcome to today's talk Saturday the 17th of December. Now, I'd been reading about this article in the popular press and on various social media places about a study which purported to show that people that were unvaccinated against Covid-19 were 72 percent more likely to be involved in a traffic accident. Now, I just assumed that this was a joke, but it actually turns out it's not. When I actually looked into it, it turns out this is actually based on something that's purported, that it's to be a scientific paper. And here it is. It comes largely from workers in Toronto and it's published in the American Journal of Medicine and it's a full scientific paper. Absolutely quite incredible. And for example, here they're pointing out that people that have no vaccine get more accidents than people that have had the vaccine over a period of a month. This is not a joke. This is actually purported to be a genuine scientific paper. And I really feel that these authors and the American Journal of Medicine have done themselves no favour at all with this. Now, they do claim, of course, that the study is a correlation. They're not saying it's causal, but there is a but here because they actually put for this diagram as well here, where they actually point out potential causal mechanisms. And I'm not going through this at all. It's quite weak. But while they actually say that this is a correlation study, they actually do try and give some potential causal mechanisms. Now, it's a population study. Over 11 million people, quite how they got the data, you and I can't get access to the data, of course, it's not public domain data. But they give reasons why it's a good data and that they attest to the validity of this data. So I think we can accept that. But pity that it's not open to a public access, therefore peer review. Talking about peer review, it really makes me wonder what the peer reviewers were thinking when they looked at this article. But there's a few factors. So 72 percent more likely to have an accident if you are unvaccinated. In other words, vaccination against COVID is protecting against accidents according to this line of thinking. But there's a few things to look at. And I'm going to look at this in quite a lot of detail, but not in this short video. This is just a bit of an introduction. So in Canada, in 2021, when this data is referring to, people that were unvaccinated weren't allowed to use public transport, a lot of public transport in Canada anyway, planes, trains, buses. So they were forced to rely on cars, so they were going to be traveling more. And the unvaccinated it turns out in Ontario were more likely to work, sorry, the vaccinated in Ontario were more likely to work remotely. So people who were unvaccinated were more likely to have to travel in to work. And again, I've got evidence for this that's in the description. So for example, over 65s had a very low accident rate, but of course they don't commute, they don't commute to work. Now it turns out that this data, and they look at over 6000 accidents includes drivers, passengers and pedestrians. So at the seriously trying to make the point that COVID vaccination protects pedestrians against road traffic accidents. It really is a bit a bizarre, and there was nearly as many pedestrians involved in the study as there were drivers, as well as passengers. Now they classed people unvaccinated for 14 days after the vaccination. But the study only lasted for one month. So if people had been vaccinated, there were clusters unvaccinated for 14 days after the vaccination. Now this could completely, or you would need us about six, like most 700 people to have been misclassified out of this, over 6000, and that will completely invalidate this data utterly, completely invalidate the results. Another thing that's slightly more disturbing really, deaths at scene when people died at the scene were excluded, and this actually works out that it excludes 84 percent of the deaths in the study. Now some people might think it's a bit convenient that they excluded deaths out the scene, because sometimes the road traffic accident is caused by a medical emergency. So for example, just say for example, if someone a driver had myocarditis, for example, and that caused a spontaneous ventricular fibrillation, a cardiac arrest, and that will cause the accident. And the person would be dead at scene, that their body may well be traumatised, but the cause of death would actually have occurred before the accident, because of the cardiac arrest. They were excluded from the study, completely excluded from the study. I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions from that. Now under vaccinated percentage in populations is usually underestimated. So unvaccinated is usually underestimated, or people vaccinated normally over-estimated. And now that means that the rate of anything will appear higher or over-estimated in people that are unvaccinated. So it doesn't matter what it is, if you're comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated. So you could have, you could say that people, people who are unvaccinated have a greater liking for porridge in the morning or whatever. So because the unvaccinated percentage is usually underestimated, and the vaccinated percentage is usually over-estimated, the rate of anything will appear higher or over-estimated in the unvaccinated, in this case road traffic accidents. And the rate of anything will appear underestimated in the vaccinated. So really quite an amusing study, if it wasn't so serious, that this actually gets into the medical literature, really is quite amusing. And that's just a very quick romp through that. I'll just point out some of the factors the authors suggested. They suggested a distrusting government might be a factor. In other words, people that distrusted government were more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents, as well as more less likely to be vaccinated. Some people might think that's offensive. Belief in freedom might be a factor. This awful thing, this belief in freedom, dear, me, imagine believing in freedom. But that might be a factor that makes people less likely to be vaccinated and more likely. So people that believe in freedom are more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents. Okay, misconceptions of everyday risk that they are purporting as an idea. They don't talk about vaccine risk, they're talking about COVID risk, of course. People that have faith in natural protection are less likely to be vaccinated, according to their thinking. And more likely to be involved in a traffic accident, faith in natural protection. Antipathy towards regulation, chronic poverty is another factor they propose, again, saying this makes people less likely to be vaccinated, more likely to be involved in an accident, exposure to misinformation, political identity. So are they really saying that you're political identity? Influences, your likelihood of being involved in a road traffic accident. Is that really what they're purporting here? And this is in the published medical literature, it really is quite incredible. Negative past experience, limited health literacy. So all you stupid people out there who have got low health literacy, it appears that you're more likely to be involved in road traffic actions because you don't realize that when a ton and a half of metal hitching body, it can do some damage. It's just incredible that this has made the literature. Social networks miss giving around public health guidelines. So people that have miss giving amongst public health guidelines really don't seem to think it's a problem to walk out in front of a car. DME, primary care physicians who wish to help patients to avoid traffic accident statistics could take this opportunity, they say, to stress standard reminders such as wearing seat belts or being speed limits and drinking alcohol. So if you're going to drive, let me give you some advice. Where is seat belt? Don't exceed the speed limit. Oh, and don't drink and drive. Ground breaking stuff. Power medics should be aware that unvaccinated patients are over represented in the aftermath of a traffic crash. So all these people are unvaccinated are really big dangers to paramedics here according to this thinking. And they actually talk about this affecting driver insurance policies in the future. So because of this groundbreaking research, we now realise that people that are unvaccinated against colored maintainer more likely to have road traffic accidents, therefore we should increase their insurance premiums. Are they really saying this? Anyway, that's just a few things about that. I'm going to look at it in a bit more detail because I'm aware I haven't given my full sort of level of evidence. So we'll be giving all the references for this. I'm going to do that as a separate video because it is quite complicated. But there we go. Needless to say, we don't accept the this contention that a COVID-19 is associated with fairly to take COVID-19 vaccine as associated with increased risk of road traffic accidents. And it's done the medical literature and the credibility of science, no good at all in my view that this has been published. So we'll leave that there for now.

Why you can't compare Covid-19 vaccines,Vox,2021-03-20,K3odScka55A,"This is the new OneDose COVID-19 vaccine from Johnson & Johnson. In early March, more than 6,000 doses were supposed to be shipped to the city of Detroit, Michigan. But the mayor said no thanks. Moderna and Pfizer are the best. And I am going to do everything I can to make sure the residents of the city to try get the best. He was referring to these numbers, the vaccine's efficacy rates. The vaccines from Pfizer, Biontech and Moderna have super high efficacy rates, 95 and 94 percent. But Johnson & Johnson? Just 66. And if you only look at these numbers, it's natural to think that these vaccines are worse than these. But that assumption is wrong. These numbers are arguably not even the most important measure of how effective these vaccines are. To understand what is, you first have to understand what vaccines are even supposed to do. A vaccine's efficacy rate is calculated in large clinical trials, when the vaccine is tested on tens of thousands of people. Those people are broken into two groups. Half get the vaccine and half get a placebo. Then they're sent out to live their lives while scientists monitor whether or not they get COVID-19 over several months. In the trial for Pfizer, Biontech, for example, there were 43,000 participants. In the end, 170 people were infected with COVID-19. And how those people fall into each of these groups determines a vaccine's efficacy. If the 170 were evenly split, that would mean you're just as likely to get sick with the vaccine as without it. So it would have a 0 percent efficacy. If all 170 were in the placebo group and zero people who got the vaccine were sick, the vaccine would have an efficacy of 100 percent. With this particular trial, there were 162 in the placebo group and just 8 in the vaccine group. It means those who had the vaccine were 95 percent less likely to get COVID-19. The vaccine had a 95 percent efficacy. Now this doesn't mean if 100 people are vaccinated, five of them will get sick. Instead, that 95 percent number applies to the individual. So each vaccinated person is 95 percent less likely than a person without a vaccine to get sick each time they're exposed to COVID-19. And every vaccine's efficacy rate is calculated in the same way. But each vaccine's trial might be done in very different circumstances. So one of the biggest considerations here when we look at these numbers is the timing in which these clinical trials were performed. This is the number of daily COVID-19 cases in the U.S. since the pandemic began. The Moderna trial was done completely in the U.S. here in the summer. The Pfizer-BioNTech trial was primarily based in the U.S. too and at the same time. Johnson and Johnson, however, held their U.S. trial at this time when there were more opportunities for participants to be exposed to infections. And most of their trial took place in other countries, primarily South Africa and Brazil. And in these other countries, not only were key rates high, but the virus itself was different. The trials took place as variants of COVID-19 emerged and became dominant infections in these countries, variants that are more likely to get participants sick. In South Africa, most of the cases in the Johnson and Johnson trial were that of the variant, not the original strain that was in the U.S. over the summer. And despite that, it still significantly reduced infections. If you're trying to make one-to-one head-to-head comparisons between vaccines, they need to have been studied in the same trial with the same inclusion criteria in the same parts of the world at the same time. If we were to take Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine and redo their clinical trial at the same time that we saw did J&J's clinical trial, we might see quite different efficacy numbers for those. These efficacy numbers really just tell you what happened in each vaccine's trial, not exactly what will happen in the real world. But many experts argue this isn't even the best number to judge a vaccine by anyway, because preventing any infection at all is not always the point of a vaccine. The goal of a vaccine program for COVID-19 is not necessarily to get to COVID-0, but it's to tame this virus, to defangate, to remove its ability, to cause serious disease hospitalization and death. It helps to look at the different outcomes of an exposure to COVID-19 like this. The best case scenario is you don't get sick at all. The worst case is death. In between, there's being hospitalized, severe to moderate symptoms or having no symptoms at all. In the absolute best circumstances, vaccines give you protection all the way to here. But realistically, that isn't the main objective of COVID-19 vaccines. The real purpose is to give your body enough protection to cover these possibilities. So if you do get an infection, it feels more like a cold than something you'd be hospitalized for. And this is one thing that every one of these COVID-19 vaccines do well. In all these trials, while some people in the placebo groups were hospitalized or even died from COVID-19, not one fully vaccinated person in any of these trials was hospitalized or died from COVID-19. One thing that I wish that Mayor would have understood was that all three vaccines have essentially 100 percent effectiveness in protecting from death. The Mayor of Detroit did backtrack and said he'd start taking Johnson and Johnson doses because it's still highly effective against what we care about most. Efficacy matters, but it doesn't matter the most. The question isn't which vaccine will protect you from any COVID infection, but which one will keep you alive or out of the hospital? Which one will help end the pandemic? And that's any of them. The best vaccine right now for you is the one that you're offered. With each shot that goes in someone's arm, we get closer to the end of this pandemic."
More vaccinated deaths than unvaccinated deaths from covid (US),Dr. John Campbell,2022-11-25,Jb2YMvfvm_M,"For the first time in the United States, we've got data that says there have been more COVID deaths in people who are vaccinated versus people who are unvaccinated. We want to look at that in a little bit of detail in a minute and put some context to it. We also want to look at the bivalent vaccine boosters that are being given in the States. We're going to be looking at information from V-Safe, which shows that 54.8 percent of vaccine recipients of the bivalent boosters had systemic side effects, most of which weren't serious in the time frame they were looking at. Now, that's about the only way I can summarize this. It is a bit complicated, and of course, YouTube rules and my own personal standards insist that we will be looking at data from official sources and other reputable sources of data, so we're not going against any guidelines from the United States government. Now, here we have this: this was a report commissioned by The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation. Vice President Cynthia Cox, who does a lot of this kind of work, mentioned that 58 percent of coronavirus deaths in August were people who were vaccinated or boosted and that is people who'd had at least a primary course of vaccines. So what it looks like is happening here is we're getting waning of the protective effects of the vaccines. It's now waning. And of course this combined with the systemic side effects that we're going to look at from the booster doses needs to be taken into account as we consider the risk of benefit analysis because we started these vaccination programmes a while ago and the risk benefit analysis has changed. We're not saying the vaccines aren't effective, we're not saying that anything about the vaccines, we're just saying the risk benefit analysis has changed. Let's go on. So therefore 42 percent of deaths in August were people who were unvaccinated. So the majority, for the first time, the more death covered deaths and the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated population in the United States. Now it's fair to contextualise this because if we look at CDC data we do find that 80.06 percent of the United States population is vaccinated. So there's more people in the vaccinated group than in the unvaccinated group but it's also true as we saw that there were more COVID deaths in the vaccinated group for the first time. Now historically this is quite interesting. So September 2021 vaccinated people 23 percent of coronavirus fatalities in people that were vaccinated. January and February 2022, it got up to 42 percent and as we saw now it's now gone up to 58 percent. So we see that the risk of benefit analysis is changing. The data is there before our eyes. So a direct quote from the Kaiser Foundation in the Washington Post. We can no longer say this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. So Mr Biden's not saying Mr Biden was wrong at the time but times have changed. We know protective effects wane and this needs to be taken into account when we look at risk benefit analysis in my view. So this was the Kaiser Foundation who conducted the analysis. Now a center for disease control and prevention. Mobility and mortality weekly report. And this is this paper here from from the CDC. So we're banging the middle of official US government data. Safety monitoring are by-veil and COVID-19 vaccines. Now August 31st, 2022. The FDA authorised the by-veil and booster for Pfizer and Moderna. MRA encoding the spike protein from the original SARS coronavirus to Amphamarko and BAA4 and BAA5. So it was this by-veil and combination vaccine. Advisory Committee on immunisation practice recommended all persons over 12 receive an age appropriate dose of one of these vaccines. That was their recommendation at the time and indeed still is. Now VSAFE is a voluntary smartphone based US safety surveillance system established by the CDC to monitor adverse events after COVID vaccination. And here we have it. So VSAFE here. Now I don't actually know too much about that. So if people that are using it in the States can give me some feedback on that. That would actually be really really quite useful to get some information on that. As of the 3rd of October I believe there were 10 million users of that period of time. So it looks like it's being fairly well used. Are we getting better data now from the States? It's certainly starting to look that way. We're getting better quality data. Now vaccine adverse prevention reporting system is the other way of course and information is also taken from that. Total data from the 31st of August the 23rd of October 14 million received a Pfizer, BioNTech, 8.2 million. The Moderna is just over I think the Moderna is just over 18s. So pretty large numbers that we're getting here. Now VSAFE is a bit more confusing. It looks like in this period of time there was 211,959 registrants over the age of 12. Slightly complicated as well because people under the age of 16 have to have supervision to use this program. So quite how that's working out. I don't really know in the States. But registrants now it looks like these are people that had just started using the app in that period of time. But as is often the case with CDC it's not that clear really. The way the right is not that, not that transparent very often. August 31st to 23rd of October is the period of time. So just that finite window of time 2022 reports in the week after vaccination. We put so this is just a one week period. Now clearly you don't have to be that clever to realize that this isn't going to pick up any potential long term side effects. We're not saying there are long term side effects but any potential long term side effects would by definition not be picked in the first week. So it is limited. But anyway injection site reaction 60.8 percent. That's not too surprising and it's not really concerning. You get a soil arm of course. Systemic reactions though this is more concerning to me 54.8 percent. Fewer than 1 percent and I think we'll see later is about 0.8 percent received medical care. So VSAFE is reporting that some people did need medical opinions in medical care after the vaccination. I don't think that's controversial. It's a simple statement of fact. Vaccine adverse events report a system. So 5,542 reported adverse events of byvalent vaccine. Pretty small number really actually. Are all the cases being reported to whereas of course not. Of course not. But 4.5 percent of those were serious. Now remember this is of cases actually reported. But still a reasonable proportion of the cases actually reported were classified as being serious adverse events. Now this is straight from the CDC. Health care providers and patients can be reassured that adverse events reported after byvalent boosts are consistent with those reported after monovalent vaccines. Do you see what they've done here? They're comparing the byvalent boosts with the monovalent, the comparing two groups. This is a relative risk. Not an absolute risk. Not saying the CDC are being disingenuous. Not at all. But they are reporting a relative risk. Not an absolute risk. The absolute risk is going to be smaller than the relative risk. How much smaller? Don't know. They didn't say. Information not given. Disappointing from the CDC that they're just talking about relative risk. Health impacts after COVID vaccines vaccination are less frequent and less severe than those associated with COVID illness. Again, they're comparing people that have had illness with people that have vaccinated a relative risk. Not an absolute risk for the whole population. Not saying the CDC are being deliberately disingenuous here. But it would have been better to have information on absolute risk as well as relative risk. Unfortunately, the absolute risk is not given. But we know it will be smaller than the relative risk. The reference they use for this is interesting because they're making this broad statement here. Health impacts. Health impacts is a broad statement. It applies to everything. But the reference they give, reference to there, is quite specific. That's the reference there. It just refers to myocarditis, paracarditis, and combinations of those, or multisysteme inflammatory syndrome and children. Within seven days or 21 days risk window after the index date. So again, this is only a 14 day window that they're taking this information from and even then they're giving it as a relative risk. I mean, we're not saying the CDC, I'm trying to give the wrong impression here, but it just doesn't seem very well written to me. I know many relatively junior academics who could write it much more clearly than this, I think. But we're not arguing with the numbers that the CDC are giving. We're more commenting on their presentation. Okay, comparison between and after vaccines after infection. Again, they're comparing between the infections and after the vaccines. Two groups, the relative risk between those. Absolute risk not given again. So we see that the CDC are really giving relative risks, comparing one group with another group, not giving the absolute risk for the population as a whole. CDC please, you need to give both. We need to know what the absolute risk is as well as the relative risk, please. Now a bit more detail here. Review of these safe data from the mobile app. Again, during August the 31st to 23rd of October, same time period. Now this is what they say, 2112,000 nearly registrants. These are presumably people that registered newly in that period of time. They covered a fairly good age group, a few 12 to 17s as we see there more in the older age groups, but a good spread of age is no complaints there at all. Quite a few of these 45 percent were the fourth dose and the fifth dose was 50.2 percent. But of course, we know that if the heart disease complications, especially that the CDC does admit can occur after vaccines, they're more likely after the second dose. So again, it's not giving a really good overall picture. It's really quite specific to these bivalent boosters that they're talking about. In the week after receiving a bivalent booster dose, local injection site reactions. Now this is interesting. 49.7 percent amongst the over 65s, higher in the younger age group and the age group that used for comparison is the 18 to 49. So younger people, men and women, getting more local reactions. Systemic reactions, it's the same. 18 to 49, getting 67.9 percent local reactions as opposed to 43.5 percent in the over 65s. And when they look at the specific problems, they see this same trend that is younger people that are getting more. So 30 percent in older people, 53 percent in younger people. Headache again, 19.7 percent in older people, 42.8 percent in younger people. And again, we see it the same with the muscle pain and the fever. Now, it reported inability to complete normal daily activities. Was 10.6 percent amongst those over 65, 19.8 percent in those aged 18 to 49 after vaccination. So over 19 percent in that younger age group couldn't carry out their normal activities after the booster vaccine. I would have thought these are fairly high numbers. Receipt of medical care was reported by 0.8 percent. Now, 0.8 percent who took medical advice after vaccination. I would have thought that is rather high, but the CDC just reported, they don't say anything about it, they just say that's what it was. I would have thought it's rather high, 0.8 percent. You can decide whether you think that's high, low or indifferent. Again, we're talking about risk-benefit analysis. So there we go. I know that's fairly data intense, but it looks like the risks after the risk of side effects after vaccination are becoming clearer with the V-safe, although I don't yet fully understand how it's working, but it's good that these are being honestly reported. And just combine that with the risk-benefit analysis that more COVID deaths are now occurring in vaccinated versus unvaccinated despite the fact we have to be clear about it, only 20 percent of the population are unvaccinated. So the vaccinated is a much larger group. Thankfully, though, COVID cases are getting milder. They still do cause some deaths, as we've seen, some hospitalisations, but the trend is that they're getting milder. And I think these things should be taken into account with a risk-benefit analysis. So that's about as far as we can go on this talk, I think. Lots of data there. All the references are given. I've been as honestly, I've been as honest to the data as I can and check the links and I'm pretty sure all of my numbers are accurate. You'll have to decide how you interpret the information I have given you. Interesting. Don't want to say any more. Well, could say more, but probably best not say more. Thank you for watching."
"Joe Rogan says tons of people ""died suddenly"" from COVID vaccine",David Pakman Show,2024-02-10,LfmhYVCCGhc,"This is really painful to watch. On the bonus show today, we are going to talk about the continued influence of the Joe Rogan podcast. We are going to talk about how, I mean, listen, influential is the most accurate word about the Joe Rogan podcast. And that's part of why this is so painful to see on a recent episode, Joe Rogan on whose show I've appeared twice just casually said, you know, it's crazy how many young people got vaccinated and then died suddenly. This is one of the most, what's the word? Is it destructive? Is it pernicious? Is it just dishonest? Is it inaccurate? Is it depressing? What? Mistatements and inaccuracies about the COVID vaccine. I'm going to play it for you. Then we're going to talk about it. Listen to this. Where is is how many people were promoters of the vaccine and then died suddenly? It's crazy how many young people just died in their sleep after they took it. And everybody's like, nothing to see here. Said an adult death syndrome. Yeah. Just died suddenly. You ever go to the died suddenly Instagram page? Like, hold my ****. There's so many and so many people like talking about people who are, you know, anti-darwin, anti-vaxxers and then then you're dead. Sorry. You bought into the wrong bull ****. But that's, you know, if you really want to get cruel, that's Darwinism. Do you not know they lie by now? Do you not, are you not aware of the opioid crisis? You're not aware of the virus? You're not aware of the various like to 25 percent of all FDA approved drugs that get pulled. It's one out of four. And you're like, you're an anti-vaxxer. You're a conspiracy theorist. You fool. Darwin's going to do its work with you. You're modifying your genes. You **** idiot. Like, what are you doing? What are you doing? You're just going to trust Pfizer? Well, they do support Anderson Cooper brought to you by Pfizer. Oh, boy. Oh, my goodness. Where do you even start with this? Where do you even start with the amount of damage that is being done here? You know, every single one of these claims is wrong. First of all, the idea that the vaccine modifies your genes, it's not true. It's been said so many times, it's been explained no matter what sort of medical expert you have explained it. Some of these folks just don't want to accept it or believe it. He talks about the movie died suddenly in the Facebook page died suddenly. That is a propaganda film, widely debunked and completely non empirically based, which features a bunch of headlines that you can find on Google about people that died and then suggests this never used to happen. Healthy young adults never used to die. And it's happening now at a greater rate than it used to. And it's because of the vaccine. And the film has gotten at one point, it was more than 20 million views. It's so hard to know because it's on different platforms and tens of millions of views is fair to say. And when you look into the film, you find that number one, the rate of these deaths hasn't increased other than by the degree to which we know people have died from COVID. We also have investigated some of the specific people that died suddenly. They weren't even vaccinated. So some of the people featured in the film were not actually vaccinated with the COVID vaccine. So total propaganda film that is leading people dangerously astray. And then, you know, there's always some, as Sam Harris said to me last week in our interview or the week last week. Yeah. Sometimes these conspiracy theories have some grain of truth. And the grain of truth here is pharmaceutical companies have lied. And pharmaceutical companies have done bad things. Joe Rogan mentions, viox and he mentions opioids. It's really important to understand that these are dramatically different sorts of medications. Viox was an N said designed to treat pain and inflammation marketed for osteoarthritis and for some acute pain conditions. And it was withdrawn from the market because there were concerns it would increase heart attack and stroke. If you used it for a long period of time. Okay. The opioid crisis opioids are an entire class of prescription pain relievers. You've got your oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine and others. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. They are known for pain relieving effects, but huge addiction potential overdose. We know about the sackler family and their deliberate deception when it comes to clinical trial side effects and risk for addiction, et cetera. Vaccines are meant to help the body generate immunity without getting the disease. That's the idea. And vaccines are one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases, including diseases that can cause death as well as diseases that are that are less likely to cause death. So when you look at the risk profiles with viox, the risk was related to cardiovascular events. And it was significant enough to say we've got it with draw this from the market with opioids. You've got addiction risk dependency over death risk. These are significant. And it has generated a public health crisis. Vaccines are low risk. Most side effects are extremely mild and temporary. Even the more rare serious side effects almost always resolve on their own when we've talked about the myocarditis paracarditis. And do you sometimes get a serious adverse event? Are there a few people that have died from serious vaccine side effects from just about any vaccine? Yes. But the point is you don't suspend an incredibly successful and effective public health campaign because any intervention can have these extremely rare side effects. You look at opioids and viox. It's a completely different situation. So anyway, the viox opioid comparisons are just absurd. It's really sad to see Rogan go in this direction. And you know, I don't know who people write to me. They go, David, you know, if only he would allow you back on, you could set them straight. First of all, it's not about setting people straight. I don't know if he would ever have me back on. I would appear anytime. That's what I've said. And that's where where I will leave it."
"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of the Covid Vaccine (with Vinay Prasad)",EconTalk 2024,2024-05-26,F19o0mTFVto,"Today is May 8th, 2024. My guest is oncologist and professor of epidemiology, Vanille Prasad of the University of California, San Francisco. This is Vanille's fifth appearance on eCountalk. He was last year in August of 2023 talking about cancer screening. Both of his 2023 appearances made the top 10 of your favorite episodes of last year. Vanille, welcome back to eCountalk. Ross, thank you for having me and it's such a treat to hear that that the listeners like those episodes. Yeah, they were awesome. Our topic for today is the COVID vaccine and in particular recent paper of yours in the Monash Biomedical Review, covered with Alston Aslam that we will link to. Title that paper is COVID-19 vaccines, history of the pandemic's great scientific success and flawed policy implementation. Before we dive in, I want to observe that it remains surreal to me that the very issue of vaccines has somehow become a huge area of discussion, a lightning rod. Much of it seems to be, if not fact-free, cherry-picked by lots of average people, not experts, but some experts too. And in somehow, it's become a such a big issue. Does this seem strange to you? Could you have imagined this drama in advance of how it's played out? If someone said to you, well, you know, it's going to be really controversial. If you were going to lie and exaggerate and ignore key facts, is this strange to you? It is strange to me, Ross. There's something about vaccines that has captured people's attention and interest and perhaps even higher for in the last 30, 40 years. There's long been a movement, I think, in America and globally skeptical of vaccines, particularly childhood immunization. And maybe that has something to do with the fact that it's injected, if they were all tablets, that might have been different. Maybe that's something to do with the fact of the age with which these vaccines are typically administered. For whatever reason, I think it has captured some small group of people's interest for a long time. But the COVID-19 pandemic, I think, naturally expanded that group. I mean, naturally, we were making policy decisions and scientific decisions, which we're going to talk about today. Some good, some not so good, some self-inflicted wounds, I think, by policymakers, some mistakes were made. And I think that naturally was just pouring kerosene on something that had been smoldering for a while, which is sort of a skeptical anti-vaccine sentiment. But you're totally right. There's so many things we do in medicine that don't capture people's interest, like giving kids Tylenol or I see them in, are giving kids, I'd be profan, or something like that when they're sick, or all the things we do in pediatrics. But some reason vaccines has always gotten people's attention. I think you're right about the injection part. I think it's important to point out, at least clarify how my fat has this right. Traditionally, vaccines are an example of the dose mix, the poison. Right? You get a little bit of the disease, and your body immobilizes your body's natural immune system to fight the recurrence. And yet, this vaccine, most, there were different variations of for COVID, but the most important ones were not of that nature. Correct. And therefore, you weren't giving yourself a dose of the disease. You don't have to say anything else, turned out that may have been challenging, but it didn't have that emotional, I think, unintuitive for many people, idea that, hey, give yourself some disease for your own good. You know, it's a really interesting observation. I think you're right that, as far back as the days of Edward Jenner, vaccines have always been either a weakened version of the virus, a weakened cousin of the virus, a weakened viral strain, or a lower dose, something to expose you to what was potentially harmful without the harm, so that you'd build immunity. So when he came across it in everyday life, you would have some resilience against it. This vaccine in a number of ways is different. Of course, I mean, we'll talk about there's a couple different platforms. Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca, which actually was withdrawn from global market yesterday, are both adenoviral vector vaccines using DNA. And then the novel, the most novel formulations were the MRNA vaccines of Moderna and Pfizer. And those are probably the ones that have maybe created the most, I think, discussion, perhaps because they are new. But also, there are some concerning safety signals across all these products. Oh, and I use that jargon again. So maybe you're going to want to unpack that. Right. No, you unpack it. Safety signal. Russ and I were just talking before. And he said, you know, in your guys' line of work, when you say safety signal, what you mean is, there's something concerning there. It's a harm. And actually, yes, that's what we mean. Like, I think typically we refer to these things as safety signals when you discover some untoward adverse events, something you didn't expect. You didn't want linked to these vaccines. And those really do play an important role in policy. And I think the big policy blunders around COVID-19 vaccination were not taking those signals serious enough, fast enough, and not acting upon them so we can get into that. Now let's start with the opening line of your paper, quote, the COVID-19 vaccine has been a miraculous life-saving advance offering staggering efficacy in adults and was developed with astonishing speed. That is the good news. And it certainly is an opening, the close quote before that before I said, that's the good news. That certainly is an answer to anyone who might say, well, the night before saw is anti-vaccine, not anti-vaccine. And so talk about what was impressive and good about this rollout. Yeah, and I think that this is something that I frame it intentionally this way because I think it's the truth. I think this is something that people don't fully admit. One, President Donald Trump launched Operation Warp Speed, which was a sort of economic incentive, economic program to expedite these vaccines to market. And what the government did was offered to essentially incur the risk of all the pharmaceutical firms. We will aid you, we will provide guidance, and we will sustain any losses you take if these vaccines are unsuccessful. That coordination, I think, was remarkably successful. Even the optimists weren't bullish enough at the speed with which the vaccine could be developed and deployed. We had a positive press release for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in November of 2021. And keep in mind in January, we were barely starting to sequence the virus itself. So all within one calendar year, I think that's a remarkable story about vaccine development. And the next thing I point I want to make is, and this is something that I think is really sort of clear from the evidence, is that if you were a 70 year old person, an 80 year old person, a 60 year old person with medical problems, if you had not already had COVID-19, and you got that vaccine in January of 2021 where millions of people globally did, that vaccine remarkably lowered your risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. And we know that because the randomized control trials, particularly one by Moderna, showed a huge reduction in severe disease from COVID-19 from having received the vaccine. So I think there's some extreme skeptics out there who say the vaccine did more harm than good in all age groups. The vaccine was, a scientific bungalow. It saved many lives. Some of the estimates, I think, are maybe misleading. Maybe they're estimates, they're kind of speculation. But there's no doubt about it. If you were an older, unimmune person, and you got that vaccine in first quarter of 2021, you had a remarkable reduction in severe disease and death as a result. Certainly randomized trials have shown the severe disease part and some observational data has shown the death part. And that's a very good thing. And it did aid in ending the pandemic. By that, I mean, COVID-19 will continue to spread. It didn't stop the spread. You can talk about that. I think, you know, there's some policy errors around the messaging around that. However, it remarkably reduced the death toll. And there are many people alive as a result of these vaccines, who otherwise would not be, had we not developed them? We interviewed Gregory Zarkerman on his book about the creation of the vaccine, which we'll link to. I've talked about how, I think I was 65 when the vaccine came out or maybe 66. I think 66. And of course, I was over 65, which meant I had a higher risk of COVID, which, you know, it's one of those weird things where it's really not discrete. It's a continuous effect. And it also depended a lot on your general health. I was generally healthy. While as listeners know, a little more heavy than I wish I otherwise were, I'm not, I don't have the worst kind of comorbidities that COVID-19 wreaked havoc with. Despite that, you know, at that point, most of us were living in what felt like the Middle Ages and the Bubonic plague. We felt danger all around us. I remember vividly going to the grocery store and putting my hands in Ziploc bags that I brought from home, touching, you know, on the handle of the cart, going through the groceries. I remember with horror when the cashier helped me bag the groceries with unwashed, unknown hands, touching my cans, and probably washing them in the early days. And when I got that first dose, as I've said here before, I felt like Superman. I felt like of the kryptonite, which I didn't think was around. I had suddenly beaten the demon of COVID. I did occasionally remember I was still mortal, but I felt immortal there for the opening, even with, you know, only with one dose. So it was a remarkable and I think a generally a wonderful thing. So what's wrong? That's all great. What weren't wrong? Well, many things went wrong. I think that's all the good stuff. And I think it's important to acknowledge the good stuff as we get into the things that we did wrong. Because I think there are some people who are quick to dismiss criticism of the vaccine in any form as sort of a blanket sort of anti-vaccine sentiment as you articulated. Now, what are the things we got wrong? I mean, just a short list. One, the rhetoric around whether or not the vaccine could halt transmission was incorrect and misleading. Number two, in the randomized control trials that led to vaccine approval, we could have explicitly tested whether or not the vaccine slowed or halted transmission. We did not do so. Number three, we started really well with older, unimmune people. But we quickly made the mistake of extrapolating our vaccine advice to people who had already had and recovered from COVID-19 and extrapolation that lacked evidence and extrapolation that sort of ran counter to a longstanding medical tradition of thinking that having had and recovered from a disease does confer some sort of durable immunity, particularly against the severe manifestations of that disease. So we extrapolated that advice incorrectly. Number four, we push this in younger and younger populations, often using the brute force of the state and the schools to mandate this, even into populations where the risk and benefit balance were more tenuous and uncertain. One of my number five, we started to discover safety signals. In other words, there were harms of this vaccine. We, the governments were reluctant to admit those harms. They delayed interrogating those harms and they failed to act upon those harms and those harms did not fall equally across the age distribution. In many cases, those harms fall, fell disproportionately among the people with the least to gain, the youngest people. One of those harms is inflammation of the heart, myocarditis. That's a harm that particularly affects young men between the ages of 16 and 22. The risk of that was massive. The Israeli experience, which we can talk about, what the first estimates were, what one in 3,000 and the second dose of the mRNA vaccines, that risk of myocarditis far exceeded the potential benefit of those doses on severe disease. So in other words, it's a roundabout way of saying, I think I'm fairly confident. For some populations, we actually started to inflict a net harm on these groups of people by recommending and mandating dose after dose after dose. And then the last thing is children, I think the evidence is quite weak, particularly children who have had COVID-19. And then finally, the benefits of an annual or biannual, perpetual vaccine policy, which is in the United States right now, we have essentially at least once a year, possibly every two times a year in certain age groups, vaccination for COVID-19, in perpetuity, till the end of time, what's the evidence for that? And so this paper, which is a very lengthy policy paper about 22 pages, talks about all of this stuff. And then one last point I want to make, it talks about all this stuff. But the last point I want to make is we should talk about the initial vaccine approval. It came out after the election. Why did it come out after the election? Not before the election, when Trump was saying it was going to come before the election, was that based on science or was that based on politics? And I think that's the first most provocative part of this paper. And I think that's a very, you're listeners might find that interesting. Yeah, let's go back to the first thing you mentioned, the transmission. It's a classic argument in economics, the technical term, is externalities, the idea being that if you don't vaccinate, you're imposing costs on people who might have very high costs of getting vaccinated themselves relative to yourself. And therefore, even though the it's your risk and your life, you might be exposing others to the dangers of the disease, others who cannot protect themselves or who's the cost of protecting them is very high on pre-health reasons. And this argument was made over and over again in the early days of the COVID-19 vaccine that a mandate was, as you argue, the argument was it was ethical. It was justified because you needed to help old people and potentially children, although here in this case, that wasn't true, but the argument saying other vaccines would be, well, you might think, well, just up to you, but no, if you don't vaccinate, you're putting elderly and children at risk who were very costly to vaccinate them, health wise costs. And you argue that's not true. Is that true at the beginning or just when the Omicron variant came out? Yeah, so I think the Omicron variant, which really sort of came out by the fourth quarter of 2021, clearly had vaccine escape, i.e. that no matter how many doses you got in the past, you could get Omicron through that and you could spread Omicron through that. However, it was known as early as the summer of 2021 in the United States from places like Provincetown, Massachusetts, where they had a sort of annual gathering of many men, 90 some 97 percent of whom have been vaccinated, but many of whom came down with COVID-19 that even some of the earlier strains could spread despite vaccination. So in other words, I think we knew pretty early on that vaccinated people could get COVID-19 even after being vaccinated that the vaccine would not be able to halt transmission, but I want to make one more point about the trial. I mean, you know, one of the points that I think is we don't talk enough about is that all global economies are put on hold. I mean, the pandemic has, as you say, it was like living in the plague. I mean, it has changed the lives of so many people. Governments are spending tens of trillions of dollars globally on pandemic, economic relief, and on all the sequela of having diminished economic productivity. So in other words, this is a huge global event. We run the randomized control trial and it would not have cost them much more and it would have been infinitely logical to do the following. And this Pfizer study that he 40,000 people we divide them into groups, have to get the vaccine, have to don't. And we measure how many of those people feel like they have symptoms of COVID-19, we test them for COVID-19. That's the study design. The study could have also been powered and designed to look at things. I think some of the critics are correct to say, how come you didn't run a study in older people and actually look at all-cause mortality as an endpoint? Could have done that. They could have run a different study in just over age of 80 and the endpoint could have been all-cause mortality. And how come you didn't, how come you didn't take your big study and basically say for at least 20,000 people in one arm, we're going to say we'll sample 5,000 people and test every one of their family members every week for COVID-19 to see, does it actually slow the spread? Not only are they less likely to get COVID, are they less likely to spread it to their family members? And you could have analyzed that in a randomized study and it would have cost a little bit of money. But in comparison to what we're spending on this, it's literally a drop in the ocean. That to me is a missed maneuver. And I worry that there's a reason why the company doesn't want to do that obviously because there's very overwhelming chance that it doesn't do that and that would undermine one of the claims of the vaccine. But to me, it's very concerning that policy makers, like at USFDA, at CDC, in the White House, and in EMA, that they didn't make the company generate those data. That's a huge missed opportunity. And I think many of us said that at the time. And I think I really don't see much justification for not doing that kind of study. And given that the government was subsidizing the creation of the vaccine, guaranteeing by guaranteeing enormous purchases, which was probably a good idea. But they extracted nothing in return for that, which could have been incredibly inexpensive relative to the profitability of the product. Two things. First, this issue about transmission. The people who took the vaccine and then still were able to spread the disease. The vaccine could still have been effective. You're saying it didn't keep them from getting the disease. It kept them from getting a more dangerous version of the disease. Their symptoms were reduced even though they still had it. And therefore they could pass it on to others very easily. Is that the key distinction there? Absolutely. That, you know, in order to benefit you, all I need the vaccine to do is reduce the likelihood that I'm going to die of COVID-19 or be in, you know, have the breathing to put down my throat from COVID-19, which I think these vaccines do. Particularly, well, I think they do that in people who have not already had COVID-19. Okay. The next thing is, does it work so well that it actually prevents me from ever even catching a milder version of this? And the answer to that is, no, it doesn't. That has different policy implications. That is implications for passports, for mandates, but not for the personal health question. You know, so I think two things are true that the 80-year-old who rushed to get it was making a wise choice, but compelling that 20-year-old to get it to protect the 80-year-old was an unwise policy decision and has huge ramifications for trust in public health and for trust in vaccines. And I'll just make one more nuance point to the listener, which is that one thing that was also unclear was that if the 80-year-old gets the shot and we compel the 20-year-old to get the shot on top of that, does that further reduce the 80-year-olds likelihood of death beyond the benefit they're getting from the personal receipt of the vaccine? And that was something that policymakers did not do a great job of studying. It was sort of this idea that I think they had this sort of fantastical idea that we could literally extinguish this virus and sort of make it extinct by vaccinating everybody that had sort of no basis. And also runs counter to what we know about coronavirus, which is that there are four circulate, prior to this, there were four circulating endemic strains of coronavirus. And we all get them over and over again in our lives. It's not the kind of thing you get once and you never get again. It mutates it changes and then you get it again a few years later, which is what's going to happen with COVID-19. We're going to keep getting it again and again in every few years as long as humanity persists, I think. Well, you mentioned the 20-year-old. I think what was even worse was the was smaller children closing in schools because the idea would be the argument was, we'll keep the kids out of school, the nine-year-old, because that way they won't be able to infect their grandparents when they go to visit. Was that part of, do you think that was a mistake? Oh, absolutely. School closure was one of the greatest policy blunders, particularly in the United States, domestic policy blunders, I think, of the last quarter century. Let's just put it in perspective. Only one nation to my knowledge was brave enough to keep schools open the entire time that was Sweden and they did that predominantly in kids under the age of 12. They never closed. Most of your Western Europe, I think, was pretty good about it. They closed for six weeks to 12 weeks, something in that ballpark, places like Germany and Spain and Switzerland. But then they reopened quickly by a fall of 2020. The United States, to my knowledge, is a one place where schools were closed in San Francisco from March of 2020 until the fall of 2021. We're talking about 18 months of school closure in urban enclaves like Los Angeles and Washington, DC and San Francisco. And this was a catastrophic policy decision. Huge, we see it through all the test score data, huge decreases in learning among these kids, often poor minority kids who potentially have the most to lose from having school closure. And the justification was that this school closure protected grandma and grandpa. We've had a couple of really nice economic analyses on this topic, including one from the University of Southern California researchers and the policy school there, including some from Germany using a natural experiment of staggered school closures in the summer of 2020. And the economists who've analyzed this rigorously find some studies find no decrease in community transmission from closing schools. That's the German study. And some find a very, very marginal difference in transmission that's unlikely to have made a big impact in the policy in COVID-19 dynamics. That's the USC conclusion. But I think most people believe that it didn't accomplish the state of Ames. It didn't slow transmission to grandma grandpa or it did so only very marginally. The kids had nothing to worry about anyway because most of them in the United States and elsewhere globally got COVID-19 without having gotten vaccination eventually. And most of them did very well. This is thankfully a disease that does not kill children the way influenza does. And the loss to children was catastrophic in terms of learning losses and grade losses. And economists will know that will have spillover effects on livelihood, employment and lifespan. That's the thing that I think the epidemiologist just did not understand. They were so singularly focused on COVID-19. They didn't understand that not going to school and losing two years of learning loss can shorten someone's life. And that to me was, you know, I think one of the big blunders. And some might be tempted to say, well, but it's worth it to save some of the elderly or some of the grandma's grandpa's being a grandfather now, which I was not in the time of COVID. I would happily accept the risk of a higher chance of COVID in return for my granddaughter having a better life. And I think it's very hard for people to think in those terms, those kind of trade-offs, maybe not every grandparent would have felt that way. I think many would have. Maybe most, if not all. And I wonder if the next time we have something like this, whether that will be the response if we're, if we encounter a disease with this incredibly strong differential impact on populations based on age. When you talk about the trial of Pfizer or the 40,000, and you said we could have made them do a more richer trial analysis and find out, you know, what the cost benefits were for different age groups. Was that the, was that what you said? That's one point and we could have proved, and we could have tested transmission directly. So we're not going to be tested directly. Now it's true that you, you have come out and said that, they're exposed. X anti at the time, do you think there was a, was there a loud outcry for that policy? And I ask because it's tempting to say that Pfizer's political influence insulated them from that request. It could have been just an error on the part of policy makers. It could have been a disagreement about what was important. There could be a lot of reasons at the time where people demanding it in the, in the, in, in medicine. Yeah. And epidemiology. So I think it's a fair point. And I often people who people say that a lot of your criticism is ex-post, but what did you say at the time? And for a while on my Twitter page, I had a pinned post of every op-ed video and podcast I did in real time to show that many of these were my policy positions at the time, not just, you know, after the fact. To this particular question, there was a New York Times op-ed written by Peter Doche, and I believe it came out in the fall of 2020 prior to the vaccine announcement. And it specifically said, we ought to design and power these studies for severe disease, not merely having symptomatic COVID-19. And then privately, I will tell you that many of us were discussing this. So I think that that that was something that was said. Now, what was said on the other side? Look, there are many things that we could have done differently in the original studies. One is, did we really need a study from 18 to 100? Could we have done, you know, separate studies like studies in, you know, randomized trial and nursing homes powered for mortality, randomized trial from 60 to 80 powered for severe disease, randomized trial in 40 to 60, looking at transmission and looking at symptomatic COVID-19. And then the last randomized trial from 18 to 40, looking at symptomatic transmission, severe disease and death. But here's one distinction. When you start to break it out by age groups in multiple studies, studies can halt at different times. We have one study, and the moment it halts, everybody on the control arm gets the vaccine. So essentially detecting safety signals is awashed, detecting whether or not the vaccine starts to lose efficacy with time is lost because everyone's getting it. But if you have a different cohorts from 18 to 40, you can run that randomized trial for, you know, six months or eight months or a year, that vaccine does not need to be made available as soon as 80 year olds. In fact, there's a supply constraint anyway, even if you were to approve it, you don't have enough vaccine for 18 year olds and 80 year olds. You get to get the 80 year olds first. So why not design these studies in a way we get more and more information, more and more safety information. Now, it's easy to say that this is all in retrospect, but I think these are principles of medicine that are longstanding and people knew that at the time, the cynical answer is that the company, of course, has very little incentives to do these studies. The longer you run the study without crossing people over, the more likely it is that people start to find that more and more safety concerns are linked to your product. And then there's also, I think, the good intention, which is that we're in the middle of a global pandemic. People want sort of a one size fits all. Yeah, we're all concerned. We're panicking. We just want a one size fits all solution. A single vaccine study, 18 and up. Let's just get it done and this vaccinated everyone and, you know, let the chips fall where they may. I think that's the, that's also part of the calculus. I would say that, you know, one of the things that my essay did was talk about attitudes about vaccine. And I think that's very interesting and I'll make a brief mention. You know, I went through many, many news stories and I documented what were the news outlets saying about vaccination by calendar year. And there's a table of quotes in 2020. And the quotes said, and you have to remember the context, Trump is on television every day. And he's saying things like, the vaccine's going to be marvelous. You're going to get it's going to be wonderful. And it's going to come out before the election. Everything will go away. You know, like these kinds of very tall claims. He's running in an election year. He's saying these things. Many people are writing op-eds saying, be careful. Just because a vaccine is approved doesn't mean it's going to work. Be careful. Even if it increases antibodies, it doesn't mean it actually reduces the risk of dying. Be careful. Some vaccines in the past have actually increased the risk of getting the virus. Be careful. Vaccines can have safety signals that take years to be known. So maybe we shouldn't rush into this. The scientists are just publishing a steady stream of this. The moment Biden wins the election, the same scientists, they switched 180. And then they say, the vaccines, they came out that you're nothing to worry about. Safety signal is pristine. I've never seen data this good. I've highlighted these quotes in my assay. I worry that some of it is politically motivated. That troubles me. And then the final thing I'll say is, PUE has public opinion polling on vaccination from May of 2020 till the election. The public opinions on vaccines cratered. I mean, this negative rhetoric in the media space in 2020, the election year absolutely destroyed Americans desire to take a COVID-19 vaccine. That's been documented by PUE. And then 2021 when Biden is in office, was an attempt to I think resurrect that and try to get people to take what they had already spent a whole year dissuading you of. Okay, then the last thing I want to say Russ about the timing of the approval. You know, Trump, Trump many times said that this vaccine will be available before the election. And I don't think he said that because of his usual bombastic nature, I think he said that because he was told that that was likely to be the case. And let me explain why he felt that was likely to be the case and what actually happened. When you run a randomized control trial of any any any randomized control trial that's blinded where you don't know who got the vaccine and who got the placebo, you have to make decisions on when you look at the data the first time. And basically what you do is you ran away to the vaccine or placebo. The primary endpoint of this study is symptomatic SARS-CoV-2, meaning people have to say I have a runny nose, I have a sore throat, and then we swab them. And then we mail that swab to Pfizer who's running genetic testing on it. And if they find COVID-19, that's scored as an endpoint one, two, three. So as the trial is running, people say I feel sick, I feel sick, they swab them, swab them, swab them. And Pfizer is running this like, oh, we have one positive, two positive, repositive. But they're blinded. They don't know which arm of this study they are. But once they have 32 positive study positive results, they have to take, this is the original statistical plan called for at 32 positive results, we're going to look at the data the first time. We'll look. And if the ratio of the positive results is 26 in one arm and six in the other arm, it's a winner. If it's 27, 5, 28, and 4, it's a success. If it's 25, sorry, if it's anything less than 26, 6, if it's 25, 7, truck keeps going, right? So this is called the stopping boundary. And extremely skewed imbalance in those swabs could stop the study at 32 events. That's the original statistical plan. And Pfizer knows how many swabs are coming in each week and how many are testing positive. And Trump knows that too. So I think Trump was very confident it'll come out in October because he knows Pfizer tells him with the rate which which these are testing positive, we'll hit 32 by mid October. I think that's what Pfizer is telling Trump, or telling the Trump team privately. And that's why he's so bullish about it coming out in October. Now here's where it gets interesting. There's a huge movement among academic doctors, epidemiologists, and the press and everybody who doesn't like Trump, you know what? Okay. I mean, that's everybody in all most of the elites, I think. They didn't want him to have it. Okay, they didn't want him to have it. So they tried many ways to delay that first look. One was asking for you know, a minimum of two month safety data rather than a medium of two month safety data. This was a proposal that didn't make a lot of sense scientifically. Ultimately, under extreme pressure, Pfizer altered the statistical plan of the study and changed the 32 look to 64 look. They made a protocol amendment to change the first look and increase the number of events. The stated reason is that this would increase the statistical confidence that the result is valid. But that's incorrect because at 64 events, less of a skew is required to trigger the stopping rule. You know, one can imagine at a thousand events, if it's 550 and 450, we stop. But at 32 events, you need a huge skew, 266, you know what I mean? A bigger percent, a bigger difference. They changed the statistical plan in October. And there did not do so, in my opinion, for any credible scientific reason. It was only to delay the time until they got the report and could stop the study. And then there is some reporting in stat that Borla himself suggested that they that they slow down on testing those swabs coming in to further kind of delay it. And coincidentally, they took the first look at something like 90s some events, which occurred in right after the election. And then they put out the press release that can a few days after the election. So the argument that I made in the essay, which I think some will find controversial, but I think is true, is that there was no medical or scientific reason to not look at 32 events, to change the protocol, changing protocol always, I think, is a problem in statistical plans. It's better to stick with what you started and keep altering it. It was done, I think, almost entirely politically motivated. And I think it actually killed people because that delay of even a few weeks in the peak of Delta wave will result in a delay of immunization at the most critical time. And so I think it was, this is something that few people recognize, but I think historians will recognize that as an incredible, incredible policy blunder. Very interesting. I think there are people in the world who think that public health officials are merely scientists looking for the truth. There are people who think that, but no one would actually be so naive to think that the head of, say, pharmaceutical company, you mentioned it, the head of Pfizer, his name is Albor Boerla. Boerla. So that was the reference you made. I think most people understand that there's a conflict of interest there. The head of a CEO of a pharmaceutical company in the American system has a profit motive at stake, which is both what is fabulous about our system and not always fabulous, the American system. And yet somehow we have this romance about a doctor in a government role. Really what you're suggesting is that they too respond to incentives. I like to think that if there is another pandemic in our near future, and these lessons are remembered that a serious scientist in a leading and a leadership role in the public health system would remember the kind of lessons you're talking about and respond differently, but maybe not. Yeah, I think while it's nice to think of public health officials and epidemiologists as impartial, I think many studies show that they're extremely left-leaning. And then while it's nice to think of science as separate from politics, I think science and politics have always been intertwined. And then I think the final point is that Trump is a uniquely triggering figure. I think we underestimate, but I mean, I work University of California San Francisco. Suffice it to say that the faculty here are not the biggest Trump supporters. Throughout the Trump administration, I think we routinely solve faculty. He really knows how to get under people's skin. In part, that might be his appeal to his own base is that he angered the people that we did. They don't like, but I think that to me, it's absolutely incredible that you could let this guy rattle you and get these policy decisions wrong. I think there's two examples. One is the schools. There's very good public opinion polling data in the United States that at the end of June, many Americans, the American Association of Pediatrics, the teachers unions, we're all calling for school reopening. Trump famously gives a speech at the end of June or early July of 2020, where he says in the fall, all the schools have to reopen. The same public opinion data shows a huge swing in sentiment about school reopening. The AAP revises their position. They actually go against children. I think it's naive to think that these organizations did not also suffer from, I think what some call Trump derangement syndrome, where you literally say the sun rises in the west just because he said it rises in the east. You're so triggered by him. You can't focus on what matters. I think school closure in the United States, many data show. It was linked to whether or not it had a strong teachers union, whether or not the city was democratically controlled, but it was not linked to the spread of COVID-19, the cases of COVID-19 and hospitalization of COVID-19, and Republican districts reopen much sooner to their credit. That to me is a problem. I say that as somebody who, as I said before on this podcast, who considers himself progressive and progressive ideals at heart, which is that as a progressive, I believe, the championing poor minority children and their education and their health is the number one value of progressives, even ahead of, and I think most cultures value children ahead of adults and elderly. To give that up because Trump said it, was literally cutting your nose despite your face. I think that was terrible. Yeah, well, a good thing he's out of off. Oh, I forgot he's running again. We'll have the same kind of challenges, I think, in policy. I've said, as part of the program, maybe from to you, I have vivid memories of him coming out on stage in the early days of the pandemic, unmasked, standing cheek to jaw with eight other members of the administration. By the way, they don't look happy. They're not keeping six feet apart from each other. They're grim. And you could say they're grim because they were in a pandemic, but I think part of the reason they're grim is that they've got to sit there and listen to their boss, and he's doing it in a way. He's speaking unmasked and close to everybody. And I believe, maybe there's even evidence for this, but I certainly believe that mask attitudes were driven by whether you've liked or disdent, like Mr. Trump. In particular, help me out here in California, there are still people wearing masks. Oh, yeah. Who are they protesting and trying to maintain anonymity in a anti-Israel protest? It's just a social signal. I'm worried and I'm showing you that I care about you, so I'm wearing a mask, which means you cannot look at my face very well. Can I read my mouth and connect to me as another human being? I found that cost of the pandemic to be non-trivial in our human relations with each other. And yet it became an incredibly intense fight, again, akin to vaccines over what should have been a mere factual matter. Yeah, absolutely. I think that the more Trump didn't wear it, the more liberal said we got to wear twice as hard. And organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics were deranged, in my opinion, recommending it to two-year-olds. And using the power of the state to compel it, that was Biden's Head Start program, compelling it in a three-year-old, where literally, you know, as a really famous researcher told me once, he's like, this is one space where you don't even need to know anything about the literature. You just need your eyes to know that making a two-year-old work-club mask is the dumbest thing on planet Earth. So that's one. You're absolutely right. In liberal strongholds in the US, there are, of course, you see it in the protesters, but even outside of that, there are many people who still mask to this day in San Francisco because they are maybe personally worried. And I think that's also, and that's not the case if you go to Texas, for instance, rural Texas. You don't see any of that. So it is, balling by political lines. But since we, you and I both care about the truth, and have no political bias, these whatsoever, either of us, what I was trying to hint at there, not hint at, but implies that I was very pro-mask in the very opening days of the pandemic. I thought it was a low-cost prudent thing to do is to wear a mask, which why I was upset that Trump did not wear one. But as the pandemic were on, and as it was clear that there was this human cost of interaccessive for children, I found it incredibly painful. The children would be looking both at each other at other children and at their parents and grandparents without fully seeing their faces. Was that an evidence-based feeling that that was wrong? I mean, what have we learned about masks that's true? I really don't know because many would argue, and I'm going to defend the left-leaning folks you're both of us are talking about, who I'm accusing them of being virtual, signolars. Isn't it better safe than sorry? Yeah, I guess a lot to say there. I mean, what is the evidence show? Well, we could start with the pre-pandemic evidence was that generally, community, I mean, I think the one thing to draw distinction is that masks people, it's not like, it's many different interventions. Mask wearing is like the ICU doctor going into the COVID-19 patients room. Should he wear an N95? That's one question. The question I think most of us care about is the community question, which is should people in the community be advised or mandated to wear masks? Should those masks be cloth masks, surgical masks or N95 masks? And how low do you go in terms of age? Did you take that down to say eight-year-olds or six-year-olds or two-year-olds in the United States? I think those to me are the more interesting policy questions. The evidence pre-pandemic was pretty conclusive that randomized studies of community masking were generally negative and did not appear to work. And that's why Fauci famously said, you know, on 60 minutes in middle of March, you don't need to wear one. You might be touching your face and doing something else that has a countervailing benefit. Then of course, I think there was an activist campaign in the United States to recommend it. And I actually didn't disagree with them too much because I think you could say, listen, out of an abundance of caution, out of prudence, we don't know, just let's do this, let's try. What I do think is also another evidence generation failure that governments like the United States and all of Europe, well, with one exception, Dan Mask, we didn't run any studies to actually try to figure it out. You know, we didn't run cluster randomized trials, we didn't try to get figure out if we actually got the policy right. And then at some point, very quickly, by the summer of 2020, it was so politically polarized that I think nobody wanted to generate the evidence. If you generated that evidence in a well done study, one side is going to be right, one side is going to be wrong. And that's going to have tremendous political implications. And I think it was actively thwarted. I know personally, like from anecdotally, that there were some discussion of trying to do it in places like United Kingdom, but there were some staunch people who thought they already knew the answer who didn't want those studies to be conducted. You know, I certainly think that right now, I think, I mean, my personal opinion is that when I see people in the store wearing it, when I see somebody on an airplane making an 18-month-old baby wear a flow mask, which I saw recently at an airplane on an interc... I think that's crazy. And I think that, like, I mean, enforcing a child to wear, even your own child to wear a mask in 2024, I think those parents need someone to talk to them at a minimum and tell them that that doesn't make a lot of sense. And in many ways, I think it's cruel. And you would have said that to somebody in 2019, if you saw them masking their kid like that in an airplane, you would have said, what are you doing to your child? This is a kid, man. But now somehow we don't go there. So I think we've talked about masks before on a prior episode. But yeah, I mean, I think now we have a new Cochrane review. And again, the new Cochrane review is pretty negative. The randomized, there are only three randomized trials run globally during the pandemic. Guinea, Vassal, Bangladesh, and Denmark, they all have limitations. And I don't think they really moved the needle forward on the evidence base that much. I mean, I think we're sort of left in the same place. And that's what the meta-analysis suggests to. When I see public now wearing the masks, which by the way, I almost never see here in Israel and see in some numbers in the United States when I'm traveling there. I try to give the folks a benefit of the doubt. I assume they have perhaps some serious condition that this gives them comfort. But the other thing I want to say is that when the disease first started, we were first aware of it. We weren't sure how it was much about how it was transmitted. We weren't sure much about it. Remember the you alluded to, I remember people saying, just don't touch your face. You really reduce your risk of the disease. And Fauci had said, and we've talked about this before in the program, that I think he was trying to reserve masks for healthcare officials. So he was discouraging public use at the time. I wish he had instead encouraged prices to solve that problem. But that's a side. People said, just don't touch your face. And I started looking at how often people touch their face. I'm touching my face now. It's almost impossible for a human being to not touch their face. It's just an interesting thing that I learned from the pandemic. But the point is that we learned fairly quickly that it was airborne. And so why wouldn't masks help a little bit? What was the reason that we now are so skeptical just on common sense grounds? Randomized controlled trials are difficult. People do other things. They don't wear them all the time. They don't wear them correctly, et cetera. Given that it's airborne, why wouldn't it always, why wouldn't caution be a bit more effective there? I mean, I think that the sort of mechanistic reasons are, you know, like, do I think it's possible that it has a small benefit, sure, but maybe it's washed away with everyday life. For instance, you know, if we go in a room for 30 seconds each and you have COVID, I don't have COVID, and we could have done these studies to these challenge studies, which people didn't do that many of, but we could have put two people in a room for 30 seconds. One, and we're neither of us are masked. I think there's a certain probability I get COVID-19. And if I wear a cloth mask, you wear a cloth mask, I don't know, maybe it goes down a little bit. But now let's change it from 30 seconds to one minute to two minutes to eight hours. You know, that's when I think you start to get into the real world. So if two people are working in an office, side by side, for eight hours, in the same stag and pool of air, does the cloth mask still have a benefit? And at some point, you got to think that, okay, this air has, you know, all the particles are circulating for the last two hours here. And eventually some of it slip in through your mask, even if you think masks have benefits. I mean, that's one mechanistic reason. The other mechanistic reason is if we're working in the office for eight hours together, you know, eventually I'm going to take a sip of coffee, you're going to have a drink, you know, it's going to slip down. And or the mask becomes soggy, or it's not filtering as much as you think it filters. And you know, all these sorts of mechanistic reasons. But ultimately, I think the beauty of sort of the bigger studies is that it accounts for all those things, how people use it, behavioral compliance, time in the room. You know, one of the things about the pediatric requirement of the US was the kids in daycare had to wear the cloth mask. You know, these kids who are like learning facial cues and talking, except for the two hours where they all lay on mats next to each other napping in the same room. Then they have to take it off because it's a suffocation risk, which to me, is, you know, who is setting that policy? You have to literally be the dumbest person I've ever, and you know, and the CDC set that policy. And then they, and then they had, sometimes they have the goal to say, you know, who are these people questioning us? And why don't people trust us? I don't think, well, you, you really set a policy that, you know, you can imagine a high school drop out from Mississippi would think that why are you making my daughter mask, you know, like that's the spritpy stupid. And then, you know, they're napping. The CDC says we have to do it. You know, how will people judge you if you set such a, you know, clearly, I call some of these policies trust shredders. Like if you set that policy that's so counter to just basic common sense, you will shred all the trust you have. And, you know, I'm not going to blame people for not trusting you again. And I assume you have nothing against Mississippi. And you only use that example because their education and test scores are not the highest. Why did you pick Mississippi? No, I have nothing against Mississippi. But yeah, I mean, just a place where I think they have a lot of college dropouts, but that's a, yeah, I'm from Indiana. Listen, I know, and nothing, Indiana's got a lot of college dropout, our high school dropouts do. Um, let's talk about a new study that came out on side effects of the vaccine, which is sort of the flip side of some of this. There's an efficacy question. And then this question about the dangers of the vaccine itself. So this, this study that we're going to talk about had a pretty large sample. 99, 9 million. Like that's a dream come true. Like if there's anything bad about these vaccines, surely we're going to find it. And the, what was the bottom line of that study and why are you skeptical of it? Well, I should say that I, I mean, I want to commend the, commend the researchers for doing that. I think it's an important step. And I think that I did learn a lot of things by reading that study. This study comes out of the journal vaccine. It's a very large analysis. It's basic method is simple. They look at the rates of, you know, certain conditions. I think something like 30 or 40 things they think might be linked to vaccine in the time period before vaccination. And, and then they look at it after people get vaccinated to see if there's an increase in that after vaccination, comparing it to sort of a baseline rate of these events. And what they found was, I think, lots and lots of potentially concerning safety signals. Of course, the things we know about the heart inflammation or myocarditis, they found that signal. They found blood clots, which are linked to Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca that they had in ovirovector vaccines. They found things that people were a little bit concerned might be linked, but we didn't have really a lot of proof that they were linked, like low platelets or immunopromocytopenia perpera, low blood counts of one of the clotting factors. And then they found, you know, a whole bunch of other things that were linked, including like a demilinating disease that affects kids, febrile seizures, a whole bunch of other concerning safety signals. Now, some of the points I want to make are number one. The authors think their method does is is not biased by reporting. I think it is biased by reporting. It's an underestimate. And hit, let me explain why. Sample size is brilliant. It's a huge sample. But and I think they're pretty good about knowing whether or not somebody got vaccinated and when they got vaccinated. I think that's a pretty rock solid data point. But one of the data points that I think is weaker is the event itself. You know, if you come in with low platelets or you come in with abdominal pain and that's due to a blood clot in the abdomen, it takes a lot before that's coded in the chart as mesenteric vein thromba, you know, a mesenteric artery thrombus or like a clot in that artery. What does it take? It takes the doctor being being like, oh boy, maybe something's going on here. The doctor has to order the CT scan, CT scan has to show the result. The result has to be coded in the chart and landed like an ICD-10 coder in electronic medical record code. There's lots of reasons to worry that that wasn't really done so well. You know, a young person comes in with belly pain. It's easy to say, you know, we look for some basic things, but maybe it's just minor and it'll feel better in a day. And you might misalign clot that was there, you know, for instance, and that doesn't get coded in the chart. And one can start to think about all the other things. If it affects populations, you're normally not looking for those kind of safety signals in. You might not be diagnosing it. You might not be coding it correctly. I think people who do electronic medical record research know that these these datasets are often full of, you know, missing data and they're really not robust. So I say all that to say, I worry that in some cases, the safety signal, in other words, that the risk of these products is actually much bigger than what these researchers found. I think that's the direction I would worry more in. And then the final point I'd say, the reason this whole paper gets me interested and concerned is, I think public health has to admit that there were some populations that were harmed as a result of vaccination. For instance, like, you know, pushing back, pushing AstraZeneca vaccines in 18-year-old women in 2021, which was done across Europe, resulted in some women getting cerebral vein thrombus in the brain and having brain herniation and dying and some women getting blood clots. To me, it's hard to believe, like even a little bit of safety signal in an 18-year-old, healthy 18-year-old may offset any potential benefit of that AstraZeneca vaccine in that 18-year-old because the risk of COVID and bad outcomes from COVID was so low in that 18-year-old already. And we have proven mathematically that for a man who's like 20 years old, dose two is harmful. I mean, he's going to get COVID either way. He's going to have some risk of COVID outcomes either way. But the risk of myocarditis is so much worse than the risk of bad COVID outcomes that you should not be giving him more doses. And I think people who had had COVID and recovered from COVID, many of them were harmed by getting vaccines. What I mean here is mathematically and aggregate, there was a net harm to that group, not that there anecdotal stories of harm, which could be acceptable if there was a net benefit to the whole group. Now, why is this important? I think this is one thing that public health refuses to admit. They refuse to admit that any of our vaccine policies and mandates actually harmed a subpopulation of people. They come up with elaborate studies that they keep saying that, well, COVID-19 is worse than the vaccine. Those studies are so catastrophically flawed and they should know it. And I just want to maybe I'll talk about that for one second. Why those studies are flawed? If you want to know how often does a vaccine cause myocarditis, we can look at the record and say everyone who got a vaccine and how many people got myocarditis. You could do that kind of math. If you want to know how often does COVID cause myocarditis, the question is, who had COVID in the data set? If you look at electronic health records in the United States, some people had COVID. But some people are didn't have COVID. But among the people who don't have COVID in the record, many of them actually had COVID. Because how does it capture COVID in that data set? In order to be in the data set as COVID, you had to be so sick from COVID. You came to the doctor, they swobbed you and put it in their computer. But most of us either had a mild, we didn't test ourselves or we tested it at home and threw away the test. And that's not in their data set. So the denominator is not all COVID-19 infections, but the worst of the worst COVID-19 infections, those that weren't medical care. And then the numerator is how many people get myocarditis or whatever from that. And they compare that against the denominator of everyone who got the vaccine and how many get myocarditis. And to me, that's such a flawed comparison. You obviously are missing the majority of COVID-19 that didn't do harmful things because those people didn't come to the hospital. Right. And so to me, I think a lot of that literature is flawed. And it is clear to me that it was a net harm in young men, particularly. So this true story happened to me. I moved to Israel before I moved here. I got my two maternal shots. And then I was just going to get a, when I came here, everyone said you should get a booster. You should get a third one. And so I went to my health clinic and they didn't have Moderna. They had Pfizer. And that alarmed me greatly. So while they were preparing me to be vaccinated, I'm desperately on my phone trying to find out if it's okay to get a third, a booster of Pfizer on top of Moderna. I did it. I didn't die. I didn't die in the office and I didn't die in the aftermath of the office. So I've had at that point three COVID-19 vaccines. So I met a party and someone asked to me if I've been boosted. And I said, yeah, and they said how many times I said, well, I've had three shots. And then they said, are you going to get another one? Because a lot of people said you should you should get one every once in a while. And I said, no, I'm not. And he said, why not? And I said, I don't know, it just seems like we don't know a lot about what this vaccine does in the long run to one's autoimmune system. And we're playing around with my body. My body is a complicated, highly, it's a well-loyal machine, of course, and a tremendously impressive thing. But I said, I just don't think it's at this point, COVID risks seem to be very small. The risk of dying from disease is very small. And he looked at me and he said, I think you're letting your political views get in the way of your common sense. And I'm proud to say that it had been 10 years before that. I think I would have gone berserk. I just looked at him and I just said, you know, you don't know me very well. But just leave it at that. That he thought that my disinterest in a booster was because I was pro-Trump, for example, as opposed to pro-antirisk, anti-downdside risk was quite, was almost amusing. It was not, it took some effort to not get upset. But I'm curious what you think we know with anything about both long COVID, which very early on got scare stories in the paper, that people with COVID, their lungs were never the same and so on. And long impacts of the vaccine, especially people were getting boosted over and over again. Do we know anything about either of those that's reliable? Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, I guess I'd say, you know, maybe for a second, I just want to say my medical philosophy, which is pre-COVID, because I think it goes to your point, Ross, which was that I think for those of us who practice medicine, we imagine there's sort of a continuum of patients, people you see. We see some healthy people, and I see I'm a cancer doctor. I see people who are nearing the end of life with cancer that's relapsed many, many times. And we have different appetite to try things, I think based on the person in front of us. If somebody comes into my office and they have multiple myeloma and they have progressed through four different prior therapies and their cancer is getting worse, and they say, doctor, you know, I'm getting tired every day and I, you know, my blood counts are taking off. I mean, this cancer is going to kill me. Can we try and then, you know, you name the drug. We try some new drug that has, you know, an uncontrolled study of 20 people and some people felt a little bit better. Can we try this new drug? I think I would. And most cancer doctors would say, that's a reasonable, you know, we don't know everything about that drug. We don't know for sure it's going to benefit you, but we know that this disease is taken off and you've tried everything that works and it's either we do try this or we're going to watch it die, you know. So I think we have an appetite for risk and uncertainty in a very sick person. Now, as you go down that continuum, newly diagnosed myeloma, the FDA's just had a new statement saying they're going to tolerate more risk. But I say, this is a condition where the median survival is 15 years. Do you really want to risk getting a drug that could cause nerve damage or Parkinsonism? You know, the risk benefit becomes more uncertain. I think you're more likely to be precautious and say, you know, less medicines is better. Let's go with what's tried and true. You can reserve those sort of unproven things for later if you need it. So, you know, we have different attitudes. I think there's some disagreement there. But with healthy people, people who come in your office, they feel totally fine. They say, I'm totally fine. You know, well, is there a way you can make me better off? I think my attitude in medicine has always been extreme skepticism, extreme, extreme, there's a really extreme conservatism in the sense that you really need a lot of evidence before you start mucking with them, before you say, well, you ought to take this medicine or that medicine. Why? Because they're healthy. The odds are in their favor, you know, and what's the evidence you have that you're really making them better off? That's one, two, throughout most of history, most of the things we did to healthy people that we thought made them better off, made them a lot worse off, you know? Healthy kid with acne, we radiate the face and okay, well, now they got a lot of cancers, you know? I mean, we did so many horrible barbaric things, not understanding safety, not understanding what we were really doing. We did radiate acne. I mean, in this country, a lot of people had radiation to the face for acne, you know, but it worked a little bit in the short term. So, you start to get that, so that's my background coming into it. And I view myself as a healthy young person. I would say that I personally am extremely reluctant to take medicines and do medical procedures unless it's proven to benefit me. Now back to your question. I think that's exactly how I feel about dose after dose of the COVID-19 shot, which is that if we wanted to know the answer, we could ask Pfizer and Moderna who have earned $100 billion from these products. Hey, run a 100,000 person randomized study each year, look for severe disease and death, look at all these outcomes, and let's see if dose nine versus the prior eight doses, you know, the ninth dose has an additional benefit. Let's see, does it vary if you're in a nursing home in your 80 versus if you're 60 and you're walking around, does it vary if you're 20? We can make them do these studies. The US FDA has repeatedly, I think, abdicated that responsibility and omitted those studies. And if anything, the level of evidence for the ninth dose is much less than the level of evidence for the first dose. They actually did do a randomized study back then. Now they do it based on antibody data and sort of a lot of speculation. So my view is, and this has nothing to do with politics. This is my view in medicine long before the pandemic, which is that the bar for dosing healthy people has to be high. And certainly, I think year after year boosters do not meet that bar. And I've written some essays saying that I'm not going to get another one until you prove it to me that it benefits me. And I think that has nothing to do with politics. Okay. Now the next part of your question, you go ahead, you want to talk about it. Yeah. The next part of your question, long COVID and long side effects. I think, I mean, it's going to be very difficult on all these topics. Long COVID, there's a lot to unpack there. I think it means many different things. If you get so sick with COVID, you come in the hospital and we have to put the breathing tube down your throat and ventilate you. I have no doubt in my mind that the path to recovery is not going to be easy. It's not going to be linear. It's going to take a long time. And we have long seen people really sick with any respiratory infection like influenza or even some of the older sort of respiratory viruses have a long path to being feeling recovered. And some of them may never feel the same after being on the vent for a couple weeks. To me, the unique thing about when people say long COVID is some people believe you can have asymptomatic or very mild COVID-19 that has, it's very mild. It's like a cold. But then four weeks later, you have a brain fog or you know, you feel fatigued all the time. And that's a sequela of the COVID-19. I think that that's a very bold claim. And I think that's a claim that is disputed. I think that some people believe that you know, you certainly feel that way. You feel very fatigued. You feel brain fog. I'm not sure it's attributable to the COVID-19. Some longitudinal studies say that the people more likely to experience it that like it's linked more closely to personality traits like neuroticism or anxiety or depression or baseline. Just like among people who herniated disc in the back, some people have persistent back pain. Some people don't. It's not as always linked to the anatomic characteristic, but sometimes social support. And you know, because pain is a combination of mind and body. So that to me is always the question with COVID-19. So in so far as the vaccines in first quarter of 2021 prevented severe disease, I believe they did. Then I believe that they did reduce the number of people who have the disability after being on the ventilator because they produce people on the ventilator. But in so far as people think the vaccines lower your risk of having brain fog when you get a cold in 2026, I think that's entirely unproven and I personally am skeptical of that claim. And so I've never seen any data to support that claim and I wouldn't be getting a shot because I'm worried about brain fog in 2027 from getting a cold in 2026. For instance, in terms of long vaccine side effects, I think these mRNA vaccines every single time you dose a man, there's a risk of myocarditis. It's about one in 10,000 for the third dose, one in 3,000 for the second dose. It never goes to zero. And so I do worry that with added dose after dose after dose, at some point that benefit harm balance is going to, I think it's already tipped for 20-year-old men, but for 40-year-old men it's going to tip two and 50-year-old men's going to tip as well. Then the final point, why is the global vaccination policy, or at least the US vaccination I would say the US? Why does the US vaccination policy have the exact same recommendation for somebody who's had COVID twice versus somebody who's never had COVID-19? And Paul off it, the vaccinologist was interviewed about this and he said that when the Biden administration took office, there was a private vote of five scientists and the vote was three two and the vote was three in favor of saying they should have the same policy and two again saying they should have a different policy accounting for some immunity from having had the virus. We know very clearly that people who hadn't recovered from COVID-19 will definitely get COVID again, but they're not going to get severe disease in death nearly at the same frequency as they would have, you know, prior to being unimmune. And that's the question here. Does the vaccine provide a further reduction in severe disease or death beyond the protection you get from having survived at once? And I think that that three two vote was wrong. I think they got it wrong. The two people in dissent were right, but to me what's most concerning is that a private vote among five people in the administration has set a policy that has such sweeping implications. Literally this policy meant there are nurses in the United States who are fired from their jobs. There are people laid off from work. People had to change the sector of employment. We forced college students to get this. We threw kids out of college. If they didn't do this, I mean, we've had to we have a professor at University California system who was fired because he didn't want to he was he was he was fired as a professor of bioethics of all things because he didn't want to do it because he had COVID-19. So you're setting a policy that's really ruining the lives of people. It's not conferring the externality of benefit to third parties because it doesn't stop transmission. And it's based on a three to two vote among people who are really kind of guessing that to me is a problem. And that to me is part of what I talk about in the essay about why how could something that's scientifically so, you know, impressive be bungled and the last thing I say is you talk about mistrust. I mean, every piece of data we have right now shows Americans are not vaccinating their kids for measles, mumps, and rubella like they did before. I mean, everything is plummeting. Vaccines are plummeting. Trust in expertise is plummeting. Trust in science is plummeting. You mentioned a couple times. What if there's a next pandemic? If there's a next pandemic in the next few years, I think America will tear itself in half. There is so much distrust of the expert community, so much deep distrust. And I think most of it is well-earned distrust. I tried to tell him not to mass the two year olds that's going to back by. I tried to tell you know, okay, but it's so such deep distrust that if we have H5N1 spread, avian flu spread for instance, I think literally half this country is going to do one thing. The other half is going to do the exact opposite. And I think there's going to be people moving states and massive upheaval. And I think if people start to use the police state to enforce things like mass compliance, try to arrest somebody who's not wearing a mask or something like that, there'll be violence. You know, I think it's a very, it's a pressure cooker situation. And as easy as it is for the government to say, point the finger and say, well, it's Joe Rogan out there. You know, it's all the misinformation spreaders who created this distrust. I think they have to look inward. They are largely responsible from bad policy decisions, firing nurses who got COVID-19, forcing college kids to boost, you know, making babies wear masks. Those decisions undermine their entire credibility and moral standing. And I think, you know, they did it to themselves, in my opinion. As a book by Gary Greenberg, which I love, I've interviewed Gary a couple of times, and I don't think I've interviewed him explicitly on the book, although issues from the book came up. It's called the Noble Lie. And it's a different perspective on the human proclivity to take a strong position sometimes in the face of evidence, the contrary, in the name of a higher good. So, for example, I think, you know, we we talk disparagingly of people who may have responded to financial incentives. But you know, I think for some folks who who were quote, pro vaccine, long into their pandemic and long after maybe it was a wise idea for many populations, they would say to you, I think, in a quiet conversation, maybe not for public public record that, well, there's this anti vaccine movement out there. So I'm always going to exaggerate the benefits of vaccines because I need to fight that dishonest view on the other side. And I just want to make the argument. It's actually, and I think in the theory of moral sentiments, but I've spent such a day to a slippery slope. It's really much better to advocate for the truth. And although the Noble Lie is always tempting, one of the worst parts of it, I think, is convincing yourself that your motivation is good. And when, especially in times when it may have more complicated drivers, but certainly this loss of trust, which is happening in all kinds of aspects of, I think, modern life, is just a devastating loss of ease by which we can make decisions. And we find ourselves at sea relying on sources that are often not true. So comment on that. No, that's so well put. I mean, I think that you are absolutely spot on that many people are exaggerating either saying things like, oh, well, we know it to be completely safe. You know, COVID, COVID is going to be worse for you anyway. They say those things. And one of their justifications is that, well, the other side is saying things that are not true. So I have to lean in, I have to exaggerate a little bit to just sort of balance that out. And to me, that's sort of absolutely unacceptable as a scientist. And as somebody who cares about reason and truth, where I think, again, no matter what anyone else is doing, you have to keep a laser focus on what the truth is, what you believe the truth is, how to articulate it best. And sometimes what that means is, you know, it's easy to be a doctor. And in January of 2020, tweet a picture of you rolling up your sleeve and say, hey, listen, I'm only, you know, I'm 27, too, and I'm getting the shot you get one, too. But the truth is really, there was a lot of ambiguity around that decision, you know, particularly for people who had had COVID. It would be much better to focus on the things we know with some confidence or certainty that older people should get it first. And then to acknowledge that, you know, if you're 27, maybe it's reasonable to do it, but you know, don't feel too much pressure. We can hold off a little bit. To me, it's always better to pursue the truth doggedly. I think I do hope it eventually wins out. I worry with COVID-19 that I do worry it's not, it may not win out, ultimately, I think that I just think one point. Many of the people who got the policy decisions wrong are winning all the national awards. And that concerns me. I mean, it concerns me to see, you know, the FDA commissioner who I think made a lot of mistakes, winning an award for the American College of Cardiology for evidence-based public practice, which I think he did a week job of. I think there's, we didn't even talk about it, but there's been a lot of concerning revelations about what the scientists believed about the origin of the virus, did it come from the lab or not? The House Committee is investigating. They find emails and Slack messages from these scientists privately acknowledging massive uncertainty, well, publicly, they're saying absolutely not 100 percent natural origin, but privately they're saying, you know, we don't know, but we can't tell that to them. And that is absolutely devastating and absolutely unacceptable. So to me, I feel like I'm not sure what will happen. You know, places like the National Academies and Medicine are sort of think are I think they would probably disagree with some of my stance. And there's certainly rewarding people who were pro-school closure, pro-masking kids, pro-mandatory boosters of 20-year-old people who had COVID. Those people are winning the awards. And so that to me suggests that we're not ready for an honest reflection, at least in the academy, which I think is the academy and the bot and the public in America, I think are almost entirely separate now. There's two groups of people who are not talking to each other. And I think a lot of my professor colleagues do not have their finger on the pulse of what the average American thinks or feels. And I think to their detriment, they're going to make some big policy errors in the future. I should have asked you before. I don't know if I've ever asked you. Are you vaccinated? Oh, yeah. Well, of course, my personal decision was the first dose, you know, I think at the time, I was maybe 36 or something. And I had never had COVID-19. I was very interested in getting dose one of the vaccine. And I ran out and got dose one of the vaccine. And I was reading the observational data showing like dose one already gives you like 94 percent of the reduction in severe hospitalization, at least in a couple of nice New England Journal papers. I also had tons of side effects from dose one, you know, like I felt wrecked. My arm, you know, pins and needles in the arm and it lasted for so long. So I was extremely reluctant to get dose two. I also knew that the timing of the two doses, which were 21 days apart for Pfizer and 28 days from Moderna, I knew that that was arbitrary, that was created merely to get the trial to complete in the tight timetable and immunologically spreading the two doses further apart would be much more reasonable. And that's what they did in the United Kingdom, of course, to their credit. So I did not get dose two on schedule. I dragged my feet and I only got dose two many months later when I received an email saying that I would be fired as a professor if I didn't get dose two. Then I got dose two. And then a few months after that, I wasn't going to get dose three. But then I got an email saying I would be fired on one day if I didn't get dose three. So I got dose three. And some people criticize me saying, well, if you really believe in your principles, you'll let them fire you. I said, yeah, yeah, how do you mind? That's ridiculous. I take Advil one day and I mean, look, I'm concerned about safety signals, but let's keep it in perspective doing to be a doctor in America, you certainly had to do more than one day of misery in your life. You know, we it's a big sacrifice. I'm not going to give that up over one little shot. I'm going to suck it up, take some Advil, take the shot and get back to work. And then and then beat him in the long game, which is changing, I think, the attitudes of people around their error in their policy. So then after three doses, then now, of course, they've given up. They threw in the towel. They stopped. I mean, they couldn't mandate it anymore. I think there's enough faculty member who would revolt. And so they weren't a detente. The university has thrown in the towel. Unfortunately, people like Aaron Caretty, he was fired. He's not been rehired. I think that's that's an embarrassment for the University of California system. To fire by all accounts, he was a professor that students loved. He's a nice guy. He had had COVID recovered from COVID. In my mind, and also that's another point we want to make. You can have a mandate, but what should the penalty be? I mean, if you go back to some of the original mandates around vaccination, the penalty was a fine $100 to, you know, there's some penalty. Should the penalty be loss of employment and a prohibition on employment in that entire sector for perpetuity? Should you get the death penalty for not getting this vaccine? And I think many people did get a death penalty because they still can't get rehired by hospitals that still have the mandate. Now, a lot of hospitals in particularly Republican areas are removing the mandate so they can hire these people back. But three years of loss of employment for not doing this, I'm not sure we're helping people. I mean, that's that's the in my opinion, the death penalty. So I think penalties should be proportionate to do the evidence as well. And that's a longstanding principle of public health ethics and it was entire overkill. So, you know, maybe you should have fined them. Find them $500 fine. You know, something like something that we can agree on. It's a deter, you know, but what they did, I think, was unjustified. So let's close. You wrote a book a while back with Adam Seafoo, another Recontact guest called Medical Reversal, happened to interview Adam about the book. You and in that conversation, we talked about how vertebral plasticity, the injection of cement into the spine after a fracture into the vertebrae of the back is actually no better than the placebo of opening the cancement, letting the person smell it. And in a recent episode, I revealed how faced with this decision for my mom would fall in it. She's 91. Had a compression fracture. She tried the wearing a brace unbelievably uncomfortable realized that was not going to be a feasible solution. I didn't think I could talk the doctor into trying the placebo effect in opening the the cancement or the tubus cement as a nonintervention noninvasive treatment. He did the treatment. She's 100 percent pain free. But as an economist, helping my mom face that decision with my siblings, I went against the so-called literature of this technique that seems to bring relief, but when tested in a clinical trial, did not, at least against this placebo. But it highlighted, forget whether that's the right decision or not. I think what's interesting is how hard it is to make decisions in these kind of areas. We have this, we have a talk about vaccination and how many to get and whether to get it and what policies should be. But the fact is, we have a lot of evidence and we still have a lot of uncertainty. So what's your reaction to that story about my mom and the general kind of issues about so-called the gold standard of the randomized control trial are finally established where the voter-plastic works versus the uncertainty we face and these kind of decisions that are probably can't be totally removed ever. Well, that's a great story. First of all, I'm glad to hear your mom is feeling better and doing well. That's the most important thing. And I think that's how your mom feels how you feel. And I guess, I mean, I think one thing to say is that when we wrote about that in the book, which was written in 2015, we were talking about, I think two paired studies in the New England journal in 2009 and they're exactly as you described us. Prior studies had shown vertibroplasty was better than say doing nothing. But what happens if you randomized people to vertibroplasty where you open this polychrylamide cement and injected into the fracture versus you take them to the operate, you take them to the room, the procedure room, you open the cement, you let them breathe, that sort of acetone smell and nail polish smell, then you throw it away and just inject some saline or don't do it at all. And the answer was both groups felt better. And so it was really sort of a placebo effect. That's what those papers showed. Now, one thing I should say is that one possibility is that since those papers were done, maybe these interventional radiologists have invented some new cement or new needle technique that is actually better. And so I think that one thing to always admit is that perhaps a larger placebo control trial done next week might actually be positive. So I don't know, you know, that's a pot. So I'm open to that possibility. I do think that if they're going to do it and make money from it, that they have such as I should have some obligation to generate that evidence or not, you haven't paid for it. The next thing I would say is that this is so true for everybody, which is the beauty of that thing was that people on the control arm actually also felt better. People who didn't get it done, there are many people who said they're paying went to zero, they felt better. They're sort of a very famous story in medicine of the internal artery, internal memory artery ligation, which is an artery in the chest that doesn't go to the heart. And if you take people with anginal chest pain, which is sort of chest pain caused by blockages in the arteries of the heart in the 1950s, they used to like high off this unrelated artery in the chest. And anecdot and many people got off the table and said, doc, I feel great now. Then of course they did a sham two sham controlled studies random lies and to do it or say you did it and didn't do it. And they both groups felt better. So placebo effect is powerful. It's real. Now I think I'm actually the real policy question as well. Should doctors actually do placebo's probably through most of human healing. A lot of what counts as traditional medicines and ancient human healing arts is a placebo and elaborate, you know, put your hands on the patient, put them in a room, have some incense burning, creating this whole environment where you can sort of coax them into a more positive mental state. Should doctors do that? And I'm actually open to that as long as sort of three things are met. I think the use of the placebo is reasonable. If you can do it in a way that's not deceiving. There are some randomized studies where you randomized people to placebo. You tell them it's placebo. The control arm is doing nothing, but they still feel better on placebo. This is an IBS study. It should be as non-invasive as possible, if possible, non-invasive and like minimize harms. And it shouldn't get in the way of some proven more effective alternative. So I think there's a lot to be explored there. But you know, your mother's story I think is so telling. And I think what it reinforces is, yeah, there will always be more than brute force, than randomized data to make these decisions. And ultimately your mom doesn't care. If it was placebo or not, she feels better, right? And that's I think one of the most interesting things about medicine. Well, the thing I'll reveal about myself. I didn't reveal it in the last conversation that I talked about this on the program. When we were trying to make this tough decision, it made tougher by the fact that my mom's 91. Thank God she's mentally totally competent. But she didn't take as many statistics classes in nursing school as her son did, who took account of metrics. So in theory, I'm an expert who loves her. And I should make a really good informed decision on her behalf. But what I want to confess is when I was trying to make that decision, I thought, you know, I wonder if that test a control trial. I wonder if the two groups were really equally in extremists, were they equally in pain? I mean, really, and surely there's some bias publication bias of finding the placebo effect. And so I thought, you know, that makes me want to err on the side of intervening and getting the cement. And by the way, this was, but I have a doctor friend who does this procedure. He does it with local lannis that occur doctor. My mom's doctor actually does it with general, which is just yet another reason not to do it, because it's a much riskier intervention. But I managed to convince myself that the randomized control trial that was in your book probably wasn't as as foolproof and iron clad as it might seem to be. And yet, I didn't look that study up. I did not give it a careful evaluation. I used my confirmation bias, I think, that I wanted to intervene. I wanted to be helpful to her. I didn't want her to wear that brace. And if it at worst, it would be the placebo effect. It was worth risking in the face of the general anesthesia risk. So I just want to confess that even though I care deeply and often evaluate studies very aggressively for their reliability in this particular case, I didn't. So it tells you something about me and maybe about in general how there's a bias toward intervening versus not intervening. You know, I mean, I don't, I think I agree with you, Russ. And I agree with your reasoning. And I don't, I don't disagree. I guess the only thing I wonder is should the manufacture of that cement be able to charge $3,000 of vile? If you can get, you know, that's the question. Because we can do the same procedure and you say, I mean, if it is in fact a placebo effect, how much should they get to charge for that cement? And then the next question is that I mean, at the end of the day, in some ways, you did the right thing because even at worst, it's placebo effect should feel a little bit better. At best, there's some real effect. And, you know, as long as the bill is not prohibitive to her or something like that, that's one of the interesting things about placebo. And thankfully, she didn't suffer any complications. So I think that's the way it could have gone wrong. You know, she could, the cement could have, you know, gone somewhere it's not supposed to and something bad could have happened. And I think that's one of the reasons why I always say that sometimes I wear my doctor hat and wear my policy hat. When I wear my policy hat, I sometimes say this medicine, you know, the data is so bad, we can't pay, we can't cover this medicine to this hospital. Then the patients in your office, you wear your doctor hat. And he said, well, you know what? It's not my job right now to decide what we're paying for. Not it's already covered. And, you know, they want to try it and they know the uncertainty. We're going to try it. You know, so I think sometimes we are a sun hat and our wearer, you know, are you kind of a kind of metrics hat. My guest today has been Beny Prasad, and I thanks for being part of e-contalk.

A man deliberately got 217 Covid shots. Here’s what happened,CNN,2024-03-06,2IXl4qJGrRk,"A German man has puzzled scientists after he deliberately got more than 200 COVID-19 vaccinations, 217 to be exact over two and a half years. That's a shot every four days, roughly. CNN Health Reporter Meg Torello is here to explain more. Meg, this guy sort of became a voluntary science experiment. Yeah, Boris, they call this guy a hypervexanated individual and researchers sort of found out about him through media reports as he was already more than 200 shots into this self-experiment he was doing. And they asked if they could study him. He was actually being investigated by the authorities in Germany for potential fraud. They suspected maybe he was trying to sell vaccination cards, but no charges were ever filed against him there. Now this guy is 62 years old. As you said, 217 COVID-19 vaccinations within the span of 29 months. If you look at the pattern of some of these and we've got a bar chart here that shows the dates of some of these shots and these are not even all of them, but if you just look in this one year span, he was getting maybe one or two per month as the beginning of the year was happening. As he gets into January of 2022, he got 48 shots within that one month period. Just days of that month, he was getting two shots per day, one in each arm. He continued with a large number of shots in February, then dropped down to just six in March. Of course, scientists are wondering what the effect was on him. First of all, he didn't report any vaccine-related side effects at all, which is sort of crazy to think about when you think about how you feel about getting a COVID shot the next day. Secondly, his immune response did show an increase in immune cells, like antibodies and T cells, but not necessarily a better or worse immune response even after more than 200 COVID vaccines. And finally, guys, he never got SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. But of course, the researchers say they don't know if that's because of so many vaccines, because of just the first few vaccines or because of his behavior or something else, but this leading to quite an interesting end of one person experiment, guys. Yeah, maybe tough to answer why someone would get 217 COVID vaccines. And so, we have a lot of patients in two years, but Meg, walk us through the same current recommendations on how many COVID-19 vaccines to get. Yeah, it goes without saying it is not 200. Right now in the United States, the general recommendation is one updated each fall, similarly to how we get the flu vaccine. And we know that only a fraction of people are actually getting an annual COVID shot at this point. The CDC did also just come out and recommend an additional shot now for people over the age of 65 to increase their immunity. So you're talking about a couple shots per year against COVID, really at the most. This guy going way outside of those bounds, but luckily, he seems to be okay. Exponentially, to say the least, Meg Torell. Thanks so much for the update on this really hard story. Thanks, Meg."
Former nurse speaks out about fake COVID vaccine card scheme,CBS New York,2024-06-11,zaPpcaF9bgw,"A former nurse on Long Island was sentenced today for a scheme at the high of the pandemic that evolved fake COVID vaccine cars. CBS Tuesday's Jennifer Glogan was in court where the judge called the woman an opportunistic thief. For the first time former nurse practitioner Julie Devono is speaking publicly since arrested for running a million dollar fraudulent COVID Vax card scheme. You do what's right and you suffer the consequences. Devono admitted to money laundering and forgery must perform 840 hours of community service in lieu of jail, probation and fines, forfeit 1.2 million much of it seized in her home in 2021, along with ledgers documenting profits. My client is the one who basically fell on the sword for everybody. The lawyer claims it was government interference with personal liberties that created the climate for fake vaccines. Anybody in our society had the right to decide for themselves. The owner of wild child pediatric health care and amity field charged hundreds for fake shots for adults and children then falsely reported that to the state while allegedly dumping thousands of scarce vials. As far as the greed at that time, the going rate for a COVID card on Long Island was $500. Londering the money on a mortgage for her home, which he shared with her husband and NYPD pilot newly retired, they must give up all firearms. Devono surrendered her nurse practitioner and registered nurse licenses and agreed to close her pediatric facility which had been open since or arrest. Supreme Court Justice John Collins admonished her. You endangered the lives of hundreds if not thousands. You are an opportunistic thief. Whatever I do next will be better because it's not New York. Devono and her family have moved to Pennsylvania but she must report to New York state probation. An odd Long Island Genoframe Logan CPS2 News."
Dad who suffered brain injury days after getting COVID vaccine sues AstraZeneca,Sky News,2024-04-29,gVxeNT07Rgs,"Jamie Scott's perfectly constructed world collapsed ten days after having the AstraZeneca COVID jab. He had a loving wife, two young boys and a well-paid job. But now he struggles with everyday life, brain damaged as a result he believes of blood clotting caused by the vaccine, a rare side effect he was unaware of. He's taking the pharmaceutical giant to court, claiming the vaccine was defective. I took it to protect the elderly people around me, but I think AstraZeneca and the government need to explain the risk whenever you take medicine. I think, because if there's a risk, if I've got a young family, I would never have taken it. Ten days after having his first dose of the vaccine in April 2021, Jamie woke up with a Sophia Hedig, started vomiting and had trouble speaking. He was rushed to hospital where he was diagnosed with a clot that was stopping blood draining from his brain as well as a hemorrhage in the brain itself. They told me he wouldn't wake up. They told me if he did wake up, he would never be the same. We often, especially to our parents when we talk about it, feel like the lookiest and lucky people, we know we were unlucky that it happened to us. We're very lucky that Jamie survived, but our lives are so drastically different. He hasn't worked since, but under the government's vaccine damage payment scheme, he was given the maximum £120,000, well, short of his expected lifetime earnings. If Jamie was in a car crash, there would have been insurance to cover the injuries and the loss of income that he's experienced. We had a lot of bad compensation, like I said, we should not have to lose our house. There has to be protection for those people who did the right thing when the government said it was safe and effective time and time again. 51 cases have been lodged in the high court with victims and grieving relatives claiming damage from the vaccine. Their lawyer says that by mid-March of 2021, other European countries were suspending all withdrawing use of the jab because of the link with clotting. The UK only advised against its use in younger people. This was very much seen and presented by Boris Johnson and his government at that time as a triumph. You know, and let's remember, you know, that there were awful days. The extra-tenic vaccine was helpful for very many people. You know, we're not just eating that, but I think the extent to which it was politics driving the decision and the extent to which it was clinical decision makers driving the decision is yet to be fully resolved. The AstraZeneca vaccine is still licensed but not used in the UK. It is in many other countries and is estimated to have saved six million lives in its first year. The Department of Health said it doesn't comment on ongoing litigation or specific cases. AstraZeneca says it updated product information for the vaccine in April 2021 to reflect the possibility in very rare cases of blood clots. A spokesperson added the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extreme rare potential side effects. Jamie and Kate feel they've been left out in the cold. He did what he felt was his duty by having the jab, but without the safety net to replace lost income, he would think twice next time. It's great to be alive and I do enjoy that with the boys and that's what I do enjoy. That's Kate and the boys and family and I'm just happy to be alive but it is a shadow and it's everyday just difficult."
Why Nazarin believes the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe | Unvaccinated,BBC,2022-07-25,85ZicYaZsbQ,"The one question that I would ask is how can you be sure that that was the vaccine and not something that would have happened anyway? Tell me about some of those stories about injuries from the vaccine. My friend Katrina, she is 28 years old. She was perfectly healthy before. She only had one dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Five days later she was beginning to experience brain fog. Now she's had a stroke. She's had three suspected heart attacks. And she's a very good friend of yours. Yeah. When else she is. Did you know her before? No. I think the one question that I would ask is how can you be sure that that was the vaccine and not something that would have happened anyway? If you've been completely healthy before, that one thing changed and then days later you're suddenly experiencing all these things you've never had before, like paralysis and seizures, the chance of that happening to someone so young I would say not possible. It's not zero though. You know in your heart that that's what caused it and it's not just her there's so many people who are going through the same thing. I just don't think it's enough to say it's happening a lot without the evidence for you. I'm actually not trying to change your mind weirdly. I'm not trying to persuade you of anything. That was such an interesting conversation. And she really cares about people. She doesn't want people to take something that could hurt them. I mean that really is ultimately a heart of it. As humans we are most affected by stories but the reason why science and mathematics and statistics, the reason why they exist is because they are the things that allow us to step outside of our emotional engagement with these topics and to give a sense of objectivity."
Vaccination and multiple sclerosis,Dr. John Campbell,2023-05-29,I9S2jooTxkQ,"Well, a warm welcome to today's talk. Monday the 29th May. Now, last week, the World Health Organization put out a release showing that there was a possible causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccine and multiple sclerosis and were allowed to report on this because it is an official WHO paper. We're limited to other things we can report, but we can report this. Now, this is the paper here. Now, it says COVID-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis via cross-reactivity with T-helper cells. So, quite a admission from the World Health Organization. Now, this isn't available on quite a few servers now, but I've got duck duck go on my desktop, so I could find it again. But that's it there. And it is, as I say, WHO publication, so we can actually talk about this. Nice to be able to talk about things. Now, what is this actually showing? What is going on here? Well, I'm going to sort of do a quick explanation of what it seems to be going on. So, what we have here, imagine this is a nerve fiber here. So, the nerve that the nerve impulses will travel down here. And this will be in the brain or the spinal cord. And these nerve fibers are surrounded by this protective myelin sheath. And in the nessentral nervous system, they're made by cells called oligodendrocytes. Here we have the spike protein from a natural SARS-CoV-N-AV2 infection. And here we have the spike protein produced by the vaccine on its own. Now, in learning to recognize, this is the CD4 lymphocyte here, the T-helper cell. This is the famous T-helper cell that's disordered in HIV. So, when people become immunocompromised, in AIDS, quite immunodeficiency syndrome, what actually happens is the virus destroys a lot of these CD4 helpers cells until they can't produce any immune response. But here it's not lack of immune response. It's too much immune response. That is the problem. So, the CD4 is learning to recognize, rightly as in the principles of vaccination, these spike proteins. And it can beat up these spike proteins, which of course is good. These are the spike proteins produced by the vaccine. And the idea is that will help the CD health cells to get rid of the spike protein. Should there be a natural infection, which we could argue about. But the point is the same sort of chemical profile that we're finding on the surface of the spike protein molecules there, we're finding very similar proteins on the surface of the, well there are very similar proteins on the surface of the myelin sheath. So, the T-helper cells are also orchestrating a response, which beats up on these myelin sheaths. And when the myelin sheaths go in central nervous system, that is multiple sclerosis. The myelin sheaths of course are essential. They facilitate what we call bouncing transmission, much faster. So, called salteachery transmission of nerve fibers, the nourish protect the nerve fibers. So, without them, basically you get progressive paralysis, is that is the main feature with multiple sclerosis. And I've looked after many hundreds of guests of multiple sclerosis patients over the years are able to be a tating disease, although with a very varying path. So, that's what seems to be happening, and that's reporting on this paper. So, if you can't find it on Safari or something, do try duck go, because that's where I got it. I actually started to prep this about three days ago, and when I went to click on it, this morning just wasn't there. You know, one of those can't find it, sort of make messages. Anyway, let's look at it in a little more detail now, because it's a pretty significant paper. And it's not only showing what this particular autoimmune reaction is to multiple sclerosis, but is there other autoimmune reactions? Well, the one I'm allowed to talk about is this one, because it's a WHO publication. You get the impression it's probably been taken down from some other servers, but hey, what do I know? Now, this is the paper here. COVID-19 vaccination can induce. Now, this is the WHO. So, can induce multiple sclerosis via cross-reactive T-helper, cell CD4-helps, cells, recognizing SARS-CoV-1 virus to spike protein, and as we've said, a Myelin, this essential Myelin, that protects the cells in the central nervous system. Now, the article goes on. Both natural infection and mRNA-vaxer-based vaccinations can be accompanied by transient autoimmune phenomena. Now, this is pretty significant in itself, because here we have the WHO. Actually, admitting that SARS-CoV-1 virus to vaccines can cause autoimmune phenomena. This is actually a pretty big breakthrough. Let's hope this paper stays up, because it really is quite a groundbreaking piece. And I am live from the WHO website now via DuckDuckGo. And I can't remember the search engine now, but it's DuckDuckGo anyway. Do let me know if you find another search engine, because I have had difficulty. So, on set of autoimmune disease, confirmed by the World Health Organization. Now, here we have a test case of two multiple sclerosis patients with clinical signs and new radiological signs. Now, what this means is, radiological signs is the, if you do MRI of the brain and the spinal cord, it's very obvious when you see multiple sclerosis, because we have these multiple patches. In the old days, multiple sclerosis used to be called disseminated sclerosis, because you get patches in different parts of the body, hence the different symptoms in different parts of the body, from different lesions in the brain and spinal cord. But we now call it multiple sclerosis. Now, they're saying it's a temporal relationship to the spike protein. Vaccine, in other words, the vaccine came first, and the multiple sclerosis came second. Does this mean there's an automatic causal correlation? No, it doesn't. But we go back to the title of the paper. COVID-19 vaccination can induce multiple sclerosis, so the very title of the paper is indicating that there is a causal relationship. That's the way I read the title of that paper. How long it will be there, for, of course, is a different matter. The aim of the study, the onset of multiple sclerosis, in two cases, very likely, so the saying very likely caused by the CD helper cells that cross recognize SARS-CoV-1 virus to a spike protein from myelin proteins. Now, spike-specific T helper cells from Perif, so they found these cells in peripheral blood and they found them in the cerebrospinal fluid. Most of you probably know the cerebrospinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord, all the central nervous systems in this cerebrospinal fluid as a shock absorber, but it's also immunologically very important as well. And they were underwent auto-antigen screening. Now, an auto-antigen is part of you. It's a part of you. It's endogenous, but it stimulates the production of auto-antibodies. So it's when one of your own proteins stimulates antibodies to beat up on your own proteins, which, of course, is the essence of autoimmune disease. And that is happening in this case, according to the WHO circular, which is still there. So they looked up a list of well-known auto-antigens in multiple sclerosis. These people knew what to look for. The results, self-reactive T cells were detected from spike-specific T cell populations. So yes, the vaccine in that sense worked. It stimulated the T helper cells, but also showed reactivity against various proteins. Now this MVP will look at in a minute. The Mog is the Myelin Oligodendrosite protein. Now, what that means is this is the central nervous system. Here's the Myelin Sheath. And in the central nervous system, this Myelin Sheath is produced by the Oligodendrosite, so the Oligodendroglile cells. So it's a protein that's specific to these cells that are producing this Myelin Sheath, the Oligodendrosite. So these are specific Myelin related proteins. Now, I'm just going to give a quick, this is papers in parentheses here, but this is just to give you some insight. This is about multiple sclerosis and Myelin-based proteins. Myelin-based protein, so this MVP that they found the cross-reactivity to one of the ones. So there's cross-reactivity between the Myelin Oligodendrosite glycoprotein and the spike protein. And there's also cross-reactivity between this Myelin-based protein here. It's a central nervous system protein in the Myelin. As MVP has long been stood as a factor in the pathogenesis in the beginning of autoimmune, the autoimmune neuro-generative disease, multiple sclerosis. So this is not new science. This is well established. It is the cross-reactivity, with the antibody produced from the vaccine that is new. And multiple sclerosis is characterized by central nervous system inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss, and as we said progressive paralysis. So getting back to the paper, finally, we found pro-inflammatory T cell clones. So in other words, the T cells were involved as well. Now the T cell involved here just seems to be the T cell. As whether or not the ones were involved, we're not told. But anyway, these pro-inflammatory T cell clones, like the CD cell, the CD4 cell. They recognize spoked spike protein and immunodomalant Myelin-based proteins. In other words, they're beating up on the Myelin teeth as well as the spike protein. And as we said, Myelin-Oligidendrocyte, glycoprotein peptides, which have previously been implicated in multiple sclerosis, they're conclusion. Detailed studies of both peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, derived CD4 plus T cells. That's the CD4 helper cells that T helper lymphocytes. shows that the onset of multiple sclerosis in these two very likely caused by the T helper cells. The clones, the population of these cells that are developed. The cross-recognized SARS-CoV-N virus to a spike protein, derived peptides and peptides to arrive from Myelin proteins. In other words, it's beating up on the same, it's beating up on the same similar structures, similar molecular structures in both of these areas. Beating up on the spike protein is good, beating up on your own Myelin in the central nervous system is potentially disastrous. I think we'll actually leave that out. There's more. I'll go on for a bit more. There's always more to say. You've got the main effort, so that's just part of the text I was working on before I lost the new duct go side. Post-misrepresent research on multiple sclerosis, found by 2WHO databases. The fact checkers have hopefully waded in on this. Quite a few fact checkers. It's obviously put the wind up them a bit. Very good of these fact checkers to tell us what's going on, so we do need to bother thinking for ourselves, but I think we'll pass on it because I think we do like to think for ourselves. This is a bit of a lawn because this is not new. Now this is a paper here. This is another paper. New diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in settings of MIA COVID vaccine exposure. This is published, published, published in January 2022. So this is based on data collected in 2021. Why wasn't this highlighted at the time? Why wasn't it highlighted at the time? Multiple sclerosis with onset, in the settings of acute SARS coronavirus, two virus infected people has been reported. So yes, it's possible after natural infection and reactivity of multiple sclerosis following mRNA COVID vaccines. There have been three reports of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following exposure to mRNA COVID vaccines. So yes, that is occurring in 2021. The association cannot be determined to be causal, of course, because it could be caused by other factors, but it's a temporal correlation, whereas the new WHO paper goes further and says it's now likely. We report this here as a five cases of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis following recent exposure of mRNA COVID vaccines. Now this bits a bit concerning latency from vaccination to initial presentation varied. Your logical manifestation of clinical course appeared a bit typical for MS. So the time between people getting vaccinated and developing the features of multiple sclerosis varied. There was latency. How long could this latency be? We don't know. In these cases it was fairly short because of course the vaccines only started in 2021. So these must have been within the course of a year. Are there more to come? We don't know that. At least we haven't been told that. Someone, probably some information around somewhere. But there's multiple sclerosis responded as normal. So their conclusion was acute neurological deficits in the settings of recent mRNA COVID vaccination and administration may represent new on-seq multiple sclerosis. So we knew that in 2022. And yet nothing changed. Incredible. Why weren't we warned of these risks at a much earlier stage? Well the research warned us but it didn't translate into any meaningful findings. Right now just a couple of quick things. This is a petition. If you're in the UK you can sign this petition here that we're concerned about the new WHO amendments and some amendments that are going to kick in in just a few months that we didn't know about that have been kept quiet. So if you click on that, if you're in the UK you can sign that petition. And when we get to 100,000 signatures there has to be a parliamentary debate. It will be a fairly small one but there has to be something. Let's go to 100,000 and stop this new international health things from the World Health Organization. At least not stop them. Let's have a parliamentary debate rather than rubber stamping it. And the other thing I'll put a link in the description as well but I've started a sub-stack as well. I don't know how much time I'll have to put on things but you can put some quite detailed physiology and pathophysiology on there as well as more news related items. So there we go. World Health Organization quite surprising really. COVID-19 vaccinations can induce multiple sclerosis from the WHO itself. And I can tell you about this one because it is an official WHO site. Let's hope the WHO published more so I'm free to discuss more pathology. A bit concerning about what's going to happen over the next couple of years in terms of prevalence but we'll find out won't we? We'll leave it there for now and thank you for watching."
A Message for People Who Don’t Want the COVID Vaccine,Jimmy Kimmel Live,2021-05-05,Y0sg9G5BBVU,"More than 100 million dollars in the United States are now fully vaccinated, which is good, but unfortunately, more than one in four say they are not planning to get the vaccine ever. 26 percent of Americans are planning to skip the shot altogether, which is crazy. I mean, I get that people are skeptical of politicians or celebrities telling them what to do, but we should listen to doctors. These are men and women who bid on the front lines of this thing risking their lives to save ours, and they're frustrated and who could blame them. We don't get more people vaccinated. We could see new mutations of this virus and go through this all over again. So as a public service, we asked some real doctors to offer their best advice to those who are on the fence about the vaccine and pay attention because this is important. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor, an actual medical doctor. I've practiced medicine for 21 years. I am a critical care nurse. I've been a nurse for 16 years. I've spent four years in undergraduate school. Been four years in medical school. And then another five years as a resident in emergency medicine. Look at all of my diplomas. I worked a second job to put myself through nursing school. I'm 53 now, and I won't have my student loans paid off until well after I retire. I can name every organ in your body and tell you exactly what it's at. Did you know there are between 60 and 100,000 miles of blood vessels in the human body? I know that because I've studied human bodies. Did you know the human body has 205 bones? Well, you're wrong. It's actually 206. I did know that because I'm a doctor. Did you know that eating raw ginger cures cancer? You did? Good. Because it doesn't. I've saved people's lives. I've cracked open a chest and manually beat a human heart. I even delivered some babies in the back cars. Do you know how many people have shown me weird skin things that parties didn't ask me if they were dying too many? My life is spent trying to improve and save yours. Oh, but you read something on Facebook? You're from high school who sells jewelry? She posted it? The one who's 53 and still builds doll houses? You heard what on a cruise podcast? Is he a doctor? No, scientist? No. Can he name one of the ingredients in the vaccine? Can he point to his gablea? Then tell him to shut the f*** up. The gable bell is right here, by the way. From that polo shot we gave your kid and then your kid not getting polio? Well, those two things are related. How about this? You do your job. I'll do mine. Get the vaccine. Get the vaccine. Just get the vaccine. Roll the f*** up and get the vaccine. And tell your friend on Facebook to stick the jewelry. Whoa. Thank you. You never go professional. Thanks for watching.

"Lunatic ""Doctor"": Everyone You Know Will Die from COVID Vaccine",David Pakman Show,2023-01-28,xYW-o8CNQiU,"Anti vaccine, so called expert, Sherry Tenpenny is again spreading fear and promulgating disinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. She is now warning everyone that is close to you is soon going to die from the COVID vaccine, not from COVID, from the COVID vaccine. Sherry Tenpenny is now warning about a tsunami of deaths in 2023. She says by the end of this calendar year, the year of the Lord 2023, every one of us will know five, maybe 10 or more people who have died from the COVID vaccine. Okay, let's listen to what she had to say. This is very instructive in terms of fear mongering and so many other things. Let's listen. Now we're seeing the tsunami of deaths that I've been talking about since the beginning of 21 millions of people are going to die. You know, when Judy Micovitz came out on the pandemic, at the beginning of that, and by the way, that was one of the biggest nonsense propaganda films, a pandemic in the Micovitz. It's crazy to even mention it. That more than 50 million people are going to die and everybody was like, whoa, and when they started interviewing me and I then asked me, what did I think about that number? I said it's way too low. It's going to be much more than 50 million people in America alone. And we're already starting to see it. We're not. So the tsunami of deaths is coming. It's already here. And I believe that what's happening now and it's starting to happen now is the tsunami of regret of the people that fell for the lies, your friends and family members, your parents and children and all they did to your grandchildren just could not be told otherwise. But now that people are dying like flies, I mean, my business partner has 83 close people in his life that have died. You know, most the truth is most people don't have 83 people in their lives that they are close to. This is like a separate issue, but these are obvious lies. 83. Yeah. No. It's the beginning. I predict that by the end of this year, every person in this room and every person listening behind here is going to know a minimum of five, probably 10 or more close friends and family. You don't have as many friends as their business partner. So you'll have only five to 10 people died. Members that have died from these shots. Right. So I want to remind everybody and this is so controversial every time people say, David, it's Sherry Tenpenny, a doctor. Is she not a doctor? And when I explain it, people get mad. Every 10 penny is not a medical doctor. She is an osteopathic physician. Now whenever I make that distinction, people start writing in, including osteopaths saying, David, you shouldn't act as though that is less than being an MD. I'm not saying anything. I'm just telling you she's not an MD. She's an osteopathic physician and her claims of no scientific basis. It doesn't mean every osteopath believes the things Sherry Tenpenny believes. I'm not saying that at all. All I'm telling you is actual medical doctors have debunked her claims, health organization, patients have debunked her claims. Many osteopaths have also debunked her claims. But in the sense that osteopathic physicians are doctors, she is indeed a doctor. Now if she sounds familiar and this is really the big point I want to make, it's because we have listened to her predictions in the past. And of course, none of them have come to pass. What I would like is accountability for these people. When they make these predictions, let's remember. And then we can follow up and say, hey, that stuff didn't happen because remember when she said this last year. The more shots you get, the more the more you destroy your immune system and the faster that happens. And it's anticipated the German data says that by the end of 2022, every fully vaccinated person over the age of 30 may have the equivalent of full-blown vaccine-induced immune-suppressed AIDS. As in gentlemen, as a fully vaccinated person over the age of 30, I am here today to tell you I do not have full-blown vaccine-induced immune-suppressed AIDS. I do have a little neck pain from a weird movement I did at the gym three days ago, but I don't have full-blown AIDS. So the point is it's fear, fear, fear. And we're going to talk about this later. I can't believe I'm saying these words, but later on in the show, I'm going to talk to you about Tucker Carlson, fear, mongering about a space vagina. I know it sounds insane, but it's what it is. They have to induce fear. Fear generates the environment they need in order to then sell you something, whether it's tickets to an event or a product or liquid, liquid silver, whatever it is they sell you. And then there's no follow-up and there's no accountability. We have to hold these people accountable for their endless failed predictions. This is yet another one of those. And if you want to, if you're listening today and you want to see what this looks like when this woman makes these claims, we'll have all of these clips on our YouTube channel youtube.com slash the David Pakman show and on our Instagram, which you can find by searching Instagram for David Pakman show."
"Covid vaccine disinformation war - Whose Truth? The vaccine, BBC World Service",BBC World Service,2024-06-17,EG8totFxL9c,"The role out of the COVID vaccine was a globally coordinated effort that saved millions of lives, but it also generated so much misinformation that the World Health Organization coined the phrase infodemic to describe it. The message is varied hugely from it being untested to it being part of a racist plot. It's easy from the outside to say, well why don't these black people want to get to vaccine? Once you get that information and you understand why somebody would choose sometimes deaths over trusting a system that has failed them. But for some communities, believing the rumors was easier than trusting the officials because of historical racism. I'm Babita Sharma and this is the documentary Who's Truth. A series where we meet Nobel prize lawyers whose work is being shaken and undermined by fake news and conspiracy theories. And the new generation taking up the challenge to question it and coming up with some answers. You know I tried to understand what is behind it. People who had no knowledge and no experience, they are so confident that they know the answer. In this episode, how misinformation around the COVID vaccine created fear and mistrust in a vaccination program to bring the world out of lockdown. How do young people navigate this tidal wave of mis and disinformation and what tools are they using and what consigners learn from them? I should go to prison, I should be hanged, I committed crime against humanity and they were, you know, vicious. Cataline Carrico was behind one of the vaccines that helped bring the world out of lockdown. She was awarded a Nobel Prize for it, but no sooner was the vaccine rolled out than she found herself at the center of a disinformation tsunami. Welcome to the program Beijing has cancelled all major public events for the lunar new year, even closing the iconic tourist spot off the forbidden city as authorities try to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. And this comes. Remember how in 2020 our lives from Australia to the Amazon were turned upside down by this new virus with the potential to infect millions. There was no cure, so we were instructed to isolate where masks stay at home. The world went into lockdown. It was unimaginable. I remember 2021, when I was reading that in China that they have to stay inside and all of this restriction, I couldn't imagine that it would happen here and then all of a sudden, oh, okay, we cannot go to the store and we couldn't buy things and it was just unbelievable. Cataline Carrico and her colleague Drew Weizmann helped develop one of the vaccines using MRNA for which they received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2023. It all started with 90-year-old Maggie Keenan at 6.30 this morning. I wasn't nervous at all, it was really good, yeah. New seats. It was one of the biggest global vaccination campaigns ever undertaken. And Cataline, who devoted her life to working on MRNA, was confident of the vaccine's success and struggled to understand some of the reactions to it. They said that the vaccine contains different methods that the vaccine has chips in it and we want to eliminate the killed people by that and these people just learn immunology on Facebook or somewhere in social media and then all of a sudden they put together things which scared other people taking the vaccine and then many people paid with their life. So as a scientist, I usually like to be in the laboratory and thinking about different things and all of the sudden I was rushed to the spotlight and I tried to take this opportunity to talk educate the people because this is very important. We have to educate and engage debates is needed because there are generally people who wanted to know how this new vaccine works. Rachel Shreya is the BBC's health reporter who specialises in disinformation. She describes how and why some of the bad information around the vaccine went viral. We see some broad themes which we've seen time and again with vaccines across history which broadly will be that vaccines are either unnecessary so we can do other things. We don't need vaccines and we can do things around hygiene or medication or whatever. There are themes that the vaccines don't work and then the really big and kind of pervasive one that we saw with Covid and that we've seen with other vaccines is that vaccines are really harmful and that they are killing more people than they save which is not the case but in order for a vaccine to be approved, scientists have to prove that they have more benefit than harm and then that'll take different forms so something that became really prevalent during Covid but again was not new was this idea that vaccines harm fertility and then the sort of extreme end of that is this belief that some people have that vaccines are part of a wider sort of sinister plot that they're being pushed by governments who want to depopulate or track or control the population and that's where we see some of that more extreme and slightly more fringe narratives like the vaccines contain microchips for example. For Dr. Caraco and the public health authorities the mix of these false messages was a huge concern. Yes, unfortunately this information caused many deaths and people just so much believed I was reading about in an emergency situation that even the patient is dying is still denying that there is a virus and then when a vaccine was available and they refused because they were so convinced that they are healthy and because they were listening to people who were talking to this part and then they believed and then and they died. You and Biantec worked in partnership with Pfizer on the vaccine to get it rolled out quickly and on a mass scale. Where do you stand in terms of your role as a scientist aligning with these big companies? I have to say that I am getting so upset when big farmer is attacked, you know I cannot understand you know I met those people who I work together they are just like me you know they are diligent scientists experts everybody trying to do their best and and work so hard and and then it was just like people judged them I mean the company is making profit but you know that how many products they try to develop and fails. This is the documentary Who's Truth from the BBC World Service. Covid was a challenge for nearly everyone but it really shone a light on the inner quality and discrimination in health. The death rate for Black African or Black Caribbean ethnic groups was two and a half times higher than for white people here in the UK and those disparities were reflected in the US too particularly in large cities where black neighborhoods were hit much harder than their wealthier white neighbors. As you know Baltimore is a very populated city it's a lot of people in Baltimore especially in our poorer areas and so Covid happening to my community was really drastic. Young elder is a songwriter and community activist from Baltimore. She was in her senior year of high school when the pandemic hit. It disrupted her education and home life and that of everyone around her. Not everybody had equal access to the resources that we needed to take care of ourselves whether that be medical resources or just regular resources like jobs or food or to purchase the things that they need whether it be laptops for schools or kids could go to school. So it's perhaps surprising to hear that the resistance to having the vaccine in her Baltimore community was so strong. A lot of times people were saying that the vaccine could give you Covid. The vaccine could cause birth defects and there were rumors like you said there were different rumors. Rumors that didn't even make sense like your skin would become magnetic like just a lot of different rumors and we never had a solid source to go to. Our source was social media. So different rumors like the vaccine doesn't work or the vaccine is a chip or that was definitely one too. They just like trying to plan a chip in us. It was a lot of different reactions to the vaccine and those reactions made it difficult for people to want to get the vaccine. Social media and the internet spread a lot of the misinformation and the disinformation around the Covid vaccine. What impact do you think that had on the information sharing between your community and people and what they were seeing? Were they only seeing the bad stuff, not the good stuff? Yes, nobody was really seeing any good stuff. There was no good stuff that we were seeing about the vaccine. We didn't know what to listen to, we didn't know what to follow. Social media, you're following people that you know. So the people that you know are saying that just disapointed with the vaccine or that is happening with the vaccine. You're going to trust the people you know even if their sources aren't credible. Why do you think the rumors that sort of disinformation around the vaccine were so long lasting, like they really took hold on some people? Well, the reason why they took hold was due to the history and the background of manipulation that has happened to black people and people of color within the medical system. It wasn't that this specific rumor was so powerful that it convinced people, or I shouldn't get the vaccine. It was a history of malpractice of black people, whether that be the Tuskegee experiment, where black men were injected with syphilis and went untreated, or just different controversies that have affected black people in negative ways. The Tuskegee syphilis study that young elders spoke about was a medical trial targeting black people. It involved withholding treatment from hundreds of men which resulted in many preventable deaths. Its impact had reverberations globally and was cited by black communities as a factor in COVID facts in hesitancy here in the UK too. Which is why the work of hip-hop public health was so useful to bridge the gap between people and science. They worked on a campaign that tackled some of these issues head on. Using a cartoon that gave prominence to voices from the black community. New York based hip-hop public health was founded by neurologist and behavior change expert Dr. Oleg GD Williams and hip-hop artist Stuggie Fresh to construct a new approach to health education. Young elder appeared in one of their COVID videos. So hip-hop public health was a network that was working towards ending the rumors and the stigma around COVID-19 in the vaccine. And we were working with producer Arty Green and different doctors from New York who produced a cartoon. And this cartoon was responsible for depicting local areas. They did want a new yoke and we had the opportunity to depict Baltimore and show what Baltimore was like in cartoon form and offer the facts that we had learned about COVID-19 to share with our peers and to share with our family. And this representation was powerful because it provided people something secure, something credible that they could trust to get that information and answer their questions about the vaccine. It seemed from watching it quite relatable as well. Why do you think it was so important to do this? It was really important because we needed the facts from somebody that we could trust, from somebody who looked like us, from somebody that we believed wouldn't be feeding us false information. So through this cartoon, we were able to serve as a representation of real people, real leaders in Baltimore, who have gotten the vaccine and who have done their own research and have worked with credible doctors to get the information, to get the facts about the vaccine and to find out the effects that it has on black people. So getting the message right is crucial, along with using community and familiar voices. Rachel Shreya from BBC Disinformation says that these techniques help boost vaccine take up in the UK, but points out that there are lessons to be learned for the future. If there isn't the access and the education to put those concerns at rest, those things then take on their own and the room and milk spreads. Are you able to assess the consequences of this spread of disinformation? Well, I think we can see it playing out now. It's not just to do with the COVID vaccine, but there are now falls in routine childhood vaccines around the world. We do have experts and community leaders linking that to concerns that came about during COVID and people who became very worried about the COVID vaccine are now looking where the more suspicious eye at other jabs as well. Was there a particular region that was less affected by the spread of disinformation around the world? It's a huge and it's a global problem and it's certainly not that it's in one country and one community. Something that we do see is that there is a relationship between trust in governments and the strength of democracies and, you know, a vulnerability to misinformation. So we often see in countries with states where there is that lower trust that people are more likely to believe in misinformation. But of course, even in sort of a wealthy or stronger democracies or kind of higher status groups, we still saw belief in misinformation, even sometimes spread by a doctor's and scientists themselves. So it's not as simple as saying it's coming from this country or it's only affecting certain groups. It's really a broad issue that has many different complex factors. So it's about trust with all the conflicting information about how the virus started and the crowdy and noisy landscape. Billions of people around the world received a vaccine against COVID. One vaccine from AstraZeneca saved millions of lives but also caused rare blood clots and a handful of people. Three years later, it has been taken off the market because the company says the virus has mutated to a degree that its vaccine is no longer commercially effective. So how do the scientists behind the vaccines suggest we build trust? Castling Caraco again. I really trust the data. So where the virus was coming from, I don't spend any minute about it because I don't know and it is not important at that point. For me, it is that the virus is here. And then when the scientists are saying certain things, you know, that you listen, try to understand and look at the data because the others are just saying an opinion and no matter how big scientists is somebody, how well respected, if there is no data to support what he says, you know, it is just an opinion and I don't care about the opinion. Everybody has their own sources and their own information but if you can go and you can get the information for yourself and you can stand step fast on that information and you know for sure that it is true. You can not only educate yourself but you can educate the people around you. I'm Babita Sharma and you've been listening to the documentary Who's Truth, a Nobel Prize Outreach and BBC World Service co-production. The series producers are Ian Rose and Claire Williamson with Philippa Goodwich. Our studio manager was Graham Puddyfoot. Thanks for listening to Who's Truth on the documentary from the BBC World Service. Stay with us on the documentary to hear more from the Nobel laureates."
Nurse faints after getting COVID vaccine,FOX 4 Now,2020-12-20,nhb1zIYXUP8,"We're seeing different reactions to the vaccine. A lot of people talking about this one. Take a look. One nurse in Tennessee fainted on the live broadcast after getting the Pfizer shot. Dr. Say it's not uncommon for people to have that reaction and minutes later, she was back on her feet. That nurse says she feels confident that her vaccine was done safely and correctly."
Can the mRNA COVID vaccines change our DNA?,Dr Matt & Dr Mike,2021-07-29,P711tS7eJK0,"Hi everybody, Dr. Martin, Dr. Mike here answering your COVID vaccine questions. Now today we have a question which asks, can the mRNA from the COVID vaccines, so the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, can they incorporate into our DNA? So that's a good question and I think the best place to start is to utilize an analogy here. So the analogy is that of a chef. Now the chef wants to make a dish and so in order to do so, the chef goes into their library and they find their cookbook and they open the cookbook up and it has a whole bunch of recipes, but they only want one recipe. Okay, chicken, tikka masala. All right, chicken tikka masala is the recipe, so they find that one recipe out of many and they have their notebook with them. They find the recipe and they copy it down into their notebook. They then put the cookbook back into the library, walk into the kitchen and they can now make the dish from that recipe. The analogy here is this, the library is the nucleus of our cell. The DNA is the cookbook contains all the instructions. The notebook that they copied that into is the mRNA and the kitchen is the cytoplasm where we turn that mRNA into proteins. The chef is something called a ribosome. Ribosomes turn mRNA instructions into proteins and proteins do everything in the body. So that's the analogy I like to use. Now the question is, what does any of this have to do with the Pfizer vaccines or the Moderna vaccines? Sure. So in front of me, I have a virus. I have the virus that causes COVID-19. This is SARS-CoV-2. What you can see on the outside of this virus are these spikes. These are the spike proteins. These are the proteins that our immune system picks up to notify our body that it's foreign and we need to build immunity against it. Now I reach into this virus and what I can find here is all the genetic material. So this is all the genetic material for the whole entire virus. So this little section here would make a particular protein here. This section here would make another protein. But this part of the RNA, let me circle it. This part of the mRNA would code and create these spike proteins. So what scientists can do is extract just that RNA and we can use that in our vaccine and now we can inject it into the arm. So once that mRNA is in the cells of my arm, those cells can then take the mRNA instruction, which then says make this. So they turn that mRNA into basically a whole bunch of these spike proteins. Now by themselves these spike proteins can't do anything but the immune system recognizes these spike proteins as not belonging to us. So they mount an immune response to it. So then if you encounter the real virus, you have a degree of immunity against it. But that mRNA that are put in your arm, what happens to that? So the mRNA stays within the cytoplasm. It doesn't jump into the nucleus where the DNA is. The dog moral biology is it goes DNA, mRNA proteins. It doesn't go backwards. So the mRNA doesn't go into the nucleus and incorporate into the DNA. In actual fact, much like Snapchat, once that mRNA is viewed, it's gone."
"People who refused COVID vaccine ""probably responsible for additional 200-300K deaths in US"": Fauci",Global News,2024-06-03,GUcpwuADC9o,"February 1st, 2020, you, yourself, Dr. Fauci, the NIH Director Collins, and at least 11 other scientists were on a conference called to discuss the origins of COVID. A number of the scientists said that they were concerned that COVID was the result of a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Veralogy, and were concerned that a revelation of the lab leak theory would hurt their relationship with China. The CDC Director Redfield testified that he was not invited on this conference call, and he believes that because he believed the lab leak theory was possible. Three days later, on February 4th, 2020, four participants on the conference call authored a paper Proximal Origin, which was sent to you for editing. Proximal Origin pushed the natural origin theory. On April 16th, 2020, the NIH Director, Dr. Collins emailed you expressing dismay that the Nature Medicine article, which was based on Proximal Origin, didn't suppress the lab leak theory, and asked you for more public pressure to suppress the lab leak theory. The very next day, in response to Dr. Collins' request to suppress the lab leak theory, you cited the Nature Medicine article, which discounted the lab leak theory from the White House podium. My question to you, sir, did you cite this article at the White House because the NIH Director asked you to suppress the lab leak theory? I did not do that in response to anybody's suggestion to suppress anything. It was in response to a question that someone asked at the podium, and I did not edit any paper as shown in my official testimony. So you said about four or five things, Congressman, that would just not true. Well, we have emails to just prove it. Well, you don't. Thank you, and I yield back. I now recognize Mr. Mfoume from Maryland for five minutes of questions. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and by the way, no, we don't have it. So I get tired of hearing we've got it, and then when we ask for it, it's not there. We do not have it, Dr. Fauci, and for everyone watching this. This was a time in history where you got to throw out the first pitch at the Washington National Spaceball Game, while Americans were forced to stay home and watch such events that they love from home alone on their televisions. And what a hypocrisy this picture shows. Here you are without your mask with empty seats everywhere. Remember the cardboard cutout fans? That was one of the most insulting things to Americans having to watch the games from home where you got to go and enjoy the game and sit right next to people, not following the six feet of distancing, not wearing your mask, and everyone else was forced to stay home and stop enjoying life. Here, your science is displayed perfectly in this picture. We're children, children in school, we're put in plastic bubbles because of your science, your repulsive, evil science. Oh, thank you. You're not allowed to be allowed. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, could you ever remove from me? Yes, thank you. I have a remute. Excuse me. I asked the Capitol Police to escort. You have thank you, she can be removed. You can be removed. Actually, not allowed to speak. Take your scorebooks with you. Mr. Garcia, Mr. Raskin, you're out of line. Your times have expired. Even before this committee started, this same member that just went on this rant introduced the Fire Fouchy Act and promoted on a podcast, seeing that COVID was a bio weapon. That is how insane some of these comments are. And I want to quote this. This is a quote from the same member. I don't believe in evolution. These viruses were not making people sick until they created them. They weaponized these viruses to be able to attach to ourselves and make us sick. It's a bio weapon. The they created them, sir, is you. They are attacking you in our medical community for actually creating COVID that has caused the deaths of millions. And we know that these extreme comments are targeting public health officials across the country. I also want to show you the Southern common. Same member who just attacked you. The Fouchy funded Wuhan lab created the virus. This is so crazy and irresponsible. In this post, the same member of this committee is accusing you of orchestrating a global conspiracy to create COVID on purpose just to make people get vaccines that you that you've done this, sir. The same member routinely promotes complete misinformation about vaccines and actually has encouraged the routine prevention of vaccinations and even eliminate diseases like the measles. Dr. Fouchy, you brought together our nation and the world's best and brightest scientists take on COVID and create a vaccine that works. I want to ask you a question. I want to be crystal clear for the public. You brought together the world and America's best scientists. Do you believe that the vaccine that you all helped create and ensure is safe and effective for the public? Yes, and it's track record has proven that. And do you also agree that it saved hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of lives in America and across the world? That is absolutely correct. And it's very clear that it's saved millions of lives here and throughout the world. The Europeans have done the same studies that we have and the data are incontrovertible that they save lives. And do you think the American public should listen to America's brightest and best doctors and scientists or instead listen to podcasters conspiracy theorists and unhinged Facebook memes? Listening to people who you've just described is going to do nothing but harm people because they will deprive themselves of life saving interventions which has happened. And you know some have done studies. Peter Hotez has done an analysis of this and shows that in people who refuse to get vaccinated for any of a variety of reasons, probably responsible for an additional two to three hundred thousand deaths in this country. Thank you sir and your entire team for saving lives in this country. And I'm sorry you have to continue going on with these attacks. What I believe the CDC used for their reason to say six feet is that studies years ago showed that when you're dealing with droplets which at the time that the CDC made that recommendation it was felt that the transmission was primarily through droplet not aerosol which is incorrect because we know now aerosol is not a good thing. Now aerosol does play a role. That's the reason why they did it. It had little to do with me since I didn't make the recommendation and my saying there was no science behind it means there was no clinical trial that proved that. That's just one of the things that got a little distorted in the response to that."
Roseanne tells Bill Maher COVID vaccine is killing EVERYONE,David Pakman Show,2023-12-05,3RIAptushYw,"I know. The funniest thing about Roseanne Barr is saying she's a comedian. I know. She appeared on the Bill Mar program and they got to talking, I guess, about elements of medical, medical elements, medical things. And Roseanne Barr tells Bill Mar the COVID vaccine is killing everyone. The billionaires want to kill us and the COVID vaccine is killing everyone. We're going to fact check this and I want to make clear for all of the different platforms that are going to limit me because I'm spreading anti-vax propaganda. I'm about to debunk, debunk, debunk, anti-vax propaganda. Okay. Let's listen to what Roseanne Barr had to say. You're all pro-chemical and pro-Montzanto and all that crazy. I'm so not. You know. Are you **** me? Are you **** me? Are you **** me? Are you **** me? You say drives me berserk. Okay. I have a, you can attack me in many things. No, I'm not going to attack you. I'm just, I know, but I want, but I need to straighten you out. No, you don't, you don't, you don't even know. Okay, okay. I'm 70. If I want it, put your hand down right there. Do it. No. Put your hand there. Why, what are you going to do? I'm going to cover it with mine and I'm going to tell you that I love you. Wow. What a 180 that was. I love you and I don't want to hurt you. I love you to hand there. I watch mine. Oh, that's right. Listen. I love you and I want to bring everybody together to see they're getting screwed and robbed. Okay. Now, are we on the same page with that? Yeah. Okay. Now let's talk. All right. I have a lot of videotape and if I wanted to go into the archive, I could send you where I pretty much alone in media was questioning the pharmaceutical industry and click people like Monsanto. I was early part of the century with the show is written. I was with one. Yeah. So I'm not the guy to hit that hit with the your four Monsanto. I was the vaccine. Shit. And I've been way out on the limb on that one too. You were wrong. I don't know which, what, I don't know what your stance on vaccines is. So once you tell me yours and I'll tell you mine, we'll see who's wrong. They're trying to kill us. They're trying to? Yeah, that's why they're giving us the vaccine. I don't think they're trying. Well, they are killing us. Well, it's much more complicated. They hate us. Who hates us, the pharmaceutical industry? No, actually the crazy, the crazy, a psychopath billionaire. Oh boy. They hate the regular people. Okay, Bernie. So, but you're not one of the regular people. How could you, you're a Southern bell. You're like an intensity Williams play and you're the, I've always depended on the kindness of strange. All right. They're killing us. They are killing us. The vaccine is killing us. We really need to take this head on because this, this will not go away. This talking point will not go away has even a single person died from the COVID vaccine. I'm open to the possibility that someone has in the sense that when millions and millions and millions and hundreds of millions, maybe billions of people get a vaccine, there are different adverse reactions and could someone die from an adverse reaction? Sure. But I've been looking everywhere. For instances where someone died from the COVID vaccine, I just haven't found a single instance, right? We start looking into the data. There have been rare cases of serious side effects that Jay and Jay vaccine was associated with a rare blood clotting disorder, specifically women under 50. The AstraZeneca vaccine wasn't even used in the United States, associated with those issues. But have any actual deaths been attributed to it? I wasn't able to find any. In terms of more generally, there's this idea that if you're 80 and you get vaccinated and you die three months later, that that's a vaccine death. And a lot of the vaccine deaths reported in the VAIR system are things like that. But can we attribute even a single one to the vaccine? I haven't been able to find a single one. With any vaccine, you can have an anaphylactic reaction. And it seems with the COVID vaccine, it was happening in five out of every million doses administered. It's a severe allergic reaction. It can occur after a flu shot or whatever. From what I've been able to find, no deaths from anaphylaxis were reported. There were studies done of other sorts of reactions, the myocarditis, the paracarditis, uncomfortable, certainly can be serious. I have been able to find no evidence that anybody actually died from it. Now you might, you might be able to find something. Hey, here's two people that we know died from a reaction they had to the vaccine. Okay. Send it to me and I will look at that. But Tucker Carlson pulled this as well, saying the vaccine could be killing thousands, hundreds of thousands of us. I still have not been able to find any evidence of that. And importantly, there have been population studies of large groups of people. Here's a group of people, the same age, one group was vaccinated. One wasn't the vaccinated group had a lower rate of all cause death in the period following the vaccine. So I would love it. If someone presented some of the evidence, Roseanne Barr certainly didn't Tucker Carlson, certainly didn't when he brought it up. If someone in the audience has the evidence, please send it to info at David Pakman dot com. Many of us have holiday parties, New Year's parties coming up.

Largest COVID vaccine study finds rare risks | CUOMO,NewsNation,2024-02-21,IMRTSwb3hCs,"Good news is, the largest COVID vaccine study to date was just released, 99 million people from around the world. It found that there is an extremely rare but increased risk for certain neurological, heart, blood, and brain disorders after taking the vaccine. But how rare is okay? And how much more is it now identified in people than before the vaccine? And also, what about all the long COVID symptoms that people are presenting? Why didn't they ask the 99 million about that? Those are all really good questions, right? You know how I know? They're not mine. They come from my doctor, double board certified physician, long COVID clinical specialist at terrain health, doctor, Robin Rose. So you called me about this and said, boy, the headline makes it sound like you got nothing to worry about. The opposite is true. Why? So the background of the study is that they looked at, like you said, these 99 million people across 10 sites, eight countries, and they identified these very significant problems that were neurologic cardiac or hematologic issues. But these are problems that with any therapeutic or vaccine that is coming out, you wouldn't want to see these issues, right? Or you wouldn't expect to see these issues. And if you did, you'd want to see them at a low rate. And there were a handful that were flagged, you know, as safety signals that were two to three times higher, you know, when they looked at, you know, they had the expected versus what the observed outcomes would be. And they were two to three times higher. Anyway, what does that mean? What does expected versus observed mean? So when you when you're rolling out, you know, with therapeutic or treatment of vaccine, you know, you expect maybe you'll have some side effects, mild, moderate, or severe side effects. So when they saw, you know, when they when they when they were looking at the data, they they knew that some of the side effects that the serious side effects, the outcomes that were observed by the data collected by these 99 million people were higher than what they had expected. Does that make sense? Yeah. And you told me that as an analogy, you were like, if we were talking about like cancers or things like that, people would not be happy about what they're seeing in this study. How so? So this is what I mean. So when the headlines come out about about vaccine, right, versus COVID, the the vaccine that's downplayed in a lot of ways or the headlines downplay what's happening. Okay. And the issue is is that in our society and in healthcare in general, we always do care about the few or the rare things that happen, right? So, you know, we pull and cancer screen everyone that's 45 years and older, you know, in the hundreds of thousands or millions of people that need to get screened because we're worried about the 32 out of every hundred thousand people that get it per year, right? Same thing with women and cervical cancer, you know, seven point seven females out of every hundred thousand per year get cervical cancer. These are rare fewer events that occur, but we care about them. We don't downplay them, and we screen these people and we try to prevent it from happening. That was my point. And here we're saying it's an acceptable loss. And you made another good point to me, which is why didn't they if they had this big cohort to work with, why didn't they ask them about a lot of other things that clinicians like you are seeing and see how prevalent they are? Well, what do you think the answer to your own question is? Right. So, exactly. There's tens of millions of people out there that are screaming from the rooftop saying that after they had the vaccine, they have suffered just, you know, basic symptoms or not that basic, but not a severe is this, but symptoms that have impaired their activities of daily living, you know, they can't live the way they used to live on a daily basis. And those are things including, you know, chest heaviness, you know, persistent headaches every day, brain fog, post-exertional malaise, neuropathy, weakness, new onset, cardiac arrhythmias, structural heart damage, autoimmune conditions, all these different things that can name a hundred other things probably. You know, why are we not looking at those things? The things that we are looking at in this study, particularly are things that are super rare and very, very serious and life threatening. Last thing, my producer just got in my ear, Ben, and said, hey, you know, the study suggests that if you were vaccinated, you're less likely to get long COVID. Is that true in your experience? In our personal experience, what we're seeing is that's a mixed bag. It's a mixed bag. We, we need a lot more data on that, but it seems that many patients that had long COVID that got vaccinated actually got worse instead of better. In my experience, and in a lot of my colleagues' experience that are taking care of these patients across the country. So I think that really has to be looked at a little closer. And Chris, there was a study too that just came out about pregnant women last week. And when you look at that study, over 51 percent of the women that were pregnant that went on to have long COVID were vaccinated. And 49 percent so there it was it was a little bit more, you know, heads more towards those patients were vaccinated went on so long COVID versus not. So this is something that again, is multifactorial. There's multiple things that play. People have had multiple vaccines and multiple closures to the virus. Hey, thank you for watching.

Former Presidents and COVID-19 Vaccine Facts | Ad Council and COVID Collaborative,Ad Council,2021-03-11,Li-oxKhvZy0,"Our fellow Americans. Right now, the COVID-19 vaccines are available to millions of Americans. And soon, they will be available to everyone. The science is clear. These vaccines will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease. They could save your life. So we urge you to get vaccinated when it's available to you. That's the first step to ending the pandemic and moving our country forward. It's up to you."
Tucker Carlson Has A Bonkers New Covid Vaccine Conspiracy Theory,MSNBC,2021-09-20,r62K2ZzOEko,"The point of mandatory vaccination is to identify this sincere Christians in the ranks, the free thinkers, the men with high-test testosterone levels, and anyone else who does not love Joe Biden and make them leave immediately. It's a takeover of the U.S. military. Last thing before we go tonight, admittedly, a huge story there, the takeover of the U.S. military and attack on those of us who are members of the free-thinking high-test testosterone community. We'll get a team on this blockbuster story tonight. We'll get on it and report back. You know, it's always been an interesting thought experiment. What must it be like to be a member of that madcap Murdoch media family? Do they embrace the crazy? Do they own it? Or are they the Romanovs of cognitive dissonance? Also, what's it like for a guy like Paul Ryan who insists on his own integrity, goodness, and earnestness to sit on the Fox board of directors? Fox News, you see bears a huge responsibility for sowing doubt about the vaccine, validating the anti-vaxxers as the pandemic continues. The folks over at the recount were thinking about that time two months ago when the MSM positively genuflected before Sean Hannity, for sounding downright normal and responsible about the public health, it turned out to be a fleeting moment that Fox has more than made up for since. Please take COVID seriously. I can't say it enough, but I never told anyone to get a vaccine. So it's clear we can't vaccinate our way out of this. Congressman, do you plan on complying with this ridiculous non-science-based mask mandate? COVID-19 now is about Marxism. This is the broader purpose of the left. You can't force me to take a medicine I don't want. If you can do that, why can't you sterilize me or lobotum? What can't you do to me? Most people are going along with this because they're afraid. A few brave souls are not. The science shows the vaccine will not necessarily protect you. It's not protecting many people. And what if Fauci's one solution doesn't work? Just entertain that idea for one moment. What if it doesn't work? Buying a fake vaccination card is an active desperation by decent law abiding Americans who have been forced into a corner by tyrants. We're starting to see this sort of apartheid-type vaccination system. What is going to be the final straw before Americans say enough is enough? Democrats in the media made COVID political. Joe Biden declared war on freedom yesterday. But you better get the vaccine or Dr. Joe Biden is going to unleash the full force of the federal government against you. It is the beginning of the communist-style social credit system. Please take COVID seriously. I can't say it enough. And so a tip of the tinfoil hat to take us off the air tonight. And here's where all that stuff ends up other than the ICU. This was a highway overpass on Friday, I-75 in Texas. The banners read, vaccines kill. You are the trial. Vaccines kill. Trump won. And so an added tip of the tinfoil cowboy hat to the anti-vax army of the I-75 overpass."

"Pfizer vaccine risk detected, CDC says",WFAA,2023-01-14,KBvys-kcJi0,Right now is 805. It's time for your morning rush here. The CDC says there could be a safety issue with Pfizer's updated COVID-19 vaccine. New numbers reveal a possible increase in a certain type of stroke in people 65 and older who recently received one of the updated boosters. This potential risk was detected using a monitoring system that called the vaccine safety data link. Seniors might be more likely to have these kinds of strokes within the first three weeks after the shot compared with weeks four through six. And a new
How the COVID-19 vaccines were created so quickly - Kaitlyn Sadtler and Elizabeth Wayne,TED-Ed,2021-08-17,v-NEr3KCug8,"In the 20th century, most vaccines took well over a decade to research, test and produce. But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared the threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed is a medical technology that's been developing for decades. The mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our bodies existing cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without ever experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might be able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these revolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. The mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid, is a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions for producing proteins. When ourselves process mRNA, a part of the cell, called the ribosome, translates and follows these instructions to build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works in exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely introduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions of mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is harmless by itself, but helpful for training our bodies' immune response. Then, they inject those molecules into a nanoparticle, roughly a thousand times smaller than the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms the membrane around ourselves. These lipids have been specially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey through the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added. Sugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact until they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a temperature of minus 20 to minus 80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components break down. Once injected, the nanoparticles disperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle fuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note that while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into ourselves, it's impossible for this material to alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and chemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components are present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome translates the mRNA's instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein is one of the spikes typically found on the virus's surface. Without the rest of the virus, this lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system can be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever and muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn't mean the recipient is sick, it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight that viral protein that will then stick around to defend against future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is likely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce the threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant advantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain weakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus. Both of which require time intensive research to prepare and unique chemical treatments to safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don't actually contain any viral particles, so they don't have to be built from scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have roughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested vaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component. To treat a new illness, researchers would identify the right viral protein, encode it into mRNA, and then swap that mRNA into the existing vaccine platform. This could make it possible to develop new vaccines in weeks, giving humanity a flexible new tool in the never-ending fight against disease. But where did vaccines get started? Watch this video to travel back to 1796 when an eight-year-old boy changed the course of history. Or get the answer to a pressing question. When exactly is a pandemic over?"
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine: Will It Change My DNA?,Nucleus Medical Media,2021-05-04,Kd-E95tXfsY,"This animation is brought to you by the Smart Image Base, a subscription website where you can download thousands of medical images and videos to use in lectures, courses, presentations, professional training, and more. For more information, click on the link in the description. mRNA Vaccines for COVID-19 Vaccines are substances that protect you from harmful diseases. Most vaccines contain parts of weakened or dead germs that trigger your immune system to fight the disease. But mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 are different. They contain a substance called mRNA that teaches your cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. In order to understand how these vaccines work, it's important to know what mRNA is and how it normally makes proteins your body needs. Most cells in your body have a command center inside them called the nucleus. It contains genetic material called DNA that consists of instructions for building and maintaining your body. Proteins are one of the building blocks of your body. When a new body protein needs to be built, instructions for building it are copied from your cells DNA and converted into a message called messenger RNA or mRNA. Then the mRNA travels out of the nucleus to a protein-building machine in your cell called a ribosome. As the ribosome reads the message from the mRNA, it builds the protein your body needs. mRNA vaccines take advantage of this process to help give you immunity to COVID-19. Each vaccine contains special mRNA that provides instructions for your cells to build a harmless piece of the virus called the spike protein. The spike protein is found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Each piece of the mRNA from the vaccine is wrapped in a protective coating. The vaccine is given as a shot in the upper arm. In the body, the mRNA particles enter your cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA travels to a ribosome. Using the mRNA from the vaccine, the ribosome makes only a piece of the spike protein from the virus. After making the piece of the spike protein, your cell destroys the mRNA from the vaccine. It's important to know that the mRNA from the vaccine never enters the cell's nucleus or changes its DNA in any way. Next, your cell presents the piece of the spike protein on its surface. This allows your immune cells to detect the protein and recognize that it doesn't belong there. As a result, your immune cells begin making antibodies as part of an immune response to the virus. In the future, if you catch the virus, the antibodies recognize and attach to the spike protein pieces on infected cells and the spike proteins on the virus. This marks them for immediate destruction by other immune cells. Like all vaccines, the benefit of these mRNA vaccines is that they give vaccinated people protection from the virus without having to get sick with COVID-19. Most mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 require you to get a second shot within a few weeks. Sometime after getting the vaccine, you may have symptoms such as a fever. This is normal. It means the vaccine is working to make you immune to the virus. Vaccines protect you, your family, and your community from diseases that can be dangerous or even deadly.

Summer wave of COVID-19 hitting U.S.,CBS News,2024-07-01,znVabOQJ960,"So just in time to crash your summer plans, cases of COVID are on the rise across the US as a new variant spreads. Although individual cases are no longer being counted, the CDC says that infections are growing or likely growing in 43 states. And this comes as the agency just last week recommended that everyone six months and older should get an updated vaccine. So for more on the summer surge, I want to bring in Dr. William Schaffner. He's a professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Good to see you again, Doctor. So what's going on? Where are we seeing, you know, possible rise in COVID cases in the US? Well, good morning, Emory. Yes, summer is back and we're about to have these summer bump that we call it of COVID paces. You know, we have a bump in the summer and then it goes down in the fall and goes up more substantially in the winter. So we are seeing an increase across the United States of infections. These new COVID variants, their grandchildren of Omicron, the most common variant are very, very contagious. Now, virtually all of us have had some experience with COVID in the past, whether through infection or vaccination or both. So what we call our population immunity is much better. So there are fewer severe diseases. That said, I will emphasize, as I always do, those people who should they get COVID are at increased risk of serious disease. Older persons, people age 65 and older, people with underlying chronic medical conditions, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, any other chronic illnesses, persons who are pregnant, and of course, people who are immune compromised. They should take precautions. If you're traveling, going indoors to group activities, dust off that mask. Put it on. That'll help you. Yeah, I was just thinking about how basically everything that we learned about communicable diseases, we just kind of thrown out the window. No, it's not that we're not wearing masks anymore, yeah, for sure. But we're eating out of communal bowls. I mean, we were just right back to where we were before. I mean, there must be a concern that, yes, there's a summer surge, but particularly after the 4th of July, because during the COVID time, after particular moments when people would gather, we would definitely, like two weeks later, see a bump. Yes, for sure. And there's an awful lot of vacation travel that's going on today. The airlines are full of people. So if you're traveling, please put on that mask and this applies particularly to people who are in those high risk groups. We want to protect them as much as possible. So I have to admit, I haven't had a vaccine in a while. I mean, since the last kind of go around a bumper shots, do you suggest that people maybe get that vaccine if they haven't in a while? Well, we should have received the vaccine last fall. We get a vaccinated vaccine each fall. And the CDC has recommended that we all do that again. This fall, but if you are in a high risk group, particularly if you're immune compromised, even though you received vaccine in the fall, you can get another one now to carry you through the summer until it's time in October, November, to get that updated annual vaccine that will be available then. You know, this is coming at a time, sort of an odd time where we're seeing these like anti-mask laws, making it illegal to wear a mask in certain places. And it has to do with protests and having to be able to identify people. If you're talking to people who are concerned, maybe they're in New York and they're traveling the subway and they're contemplating banning masks on the subway, but you're vulnerable. What do you say to those patients? This is entirely voluntary. We're not talking about mandates. This is a matter of personal protection. And so if you're in a high risk group, I'm in a high risk group, see, gray hair. So when I go to the supermarket, I put on my mask. And if I were to travel, I would use the mask the same. All right, Dr. William Schaffner, thank you so much."
New advice on covid vaccination in pregnancy,Dr. John Campbell,2022-08-30,po3GMgee-vc,"Well you're most welcome to today's talk, Tuesday evening the 30th of August. Now let's just go in straight away and give evidence for the title of this video. And of course this comes from this official government website here, John Committee on Vaccination and Immunity, issues new advice on COVID-19, vaccination for pregnant women. So this is here, this is on this site, here do check it out for yourself. Now of course if it's new guidance that means it must replace something else and the government websites I'm pleased to say I've all been updated. So I've had to go back to a bit of an archival source to demonstrate what has changed and that's from this group here from Oxford University, Oxford Population Health and they previously reported that a pregnant woman are to be considered a vulnerable group. So this information or this advice has now been changed. So in the past pregnant women are to be considered a vulnerable group emphasizing the urgency of them receiving COVID vaccine, COVID-19 vaccination and booster doses. So this has now changed and it's been updated with this new advice here. So we see a clear change in emphasis on the UK government website advice on vaccination during pregnancy. Now we are operating under some constraints here. Let me just clarify this because we want to make sure that we abide by the guidelines. Now this is from this site here which is the YouTube vaccination misinformation site telling us what we can and can't say. And just this is a state from this site. Don't paste any content in YouTube if it includes harmful misinformation about currently approving administered vaccines on any of the following. So it must include misinformation and as we'll see we've given the information directly from the government sites. Vaccines safety so we're not allowed to have content alleging that vaccines cause chronic side effects outside of the rare effects that are recognized by health authorities. And a feature efficacy of the vaccine's content claiming that vaccines do not reduce transmission or contraction of disease. So we won't be giving any evidence in contrary on contradiction to that. Now here's the another site here that we have to abide by this one. Also medical misinformation policy. So just a couple of quotes some medical misinformation policy claims about COVID-19 vaccinations that are contrary to expert consensus from the local health authority and the WHO. So we have to abide by WHO guidelines headed by Dr. Tedros of course. Claims that an approved COVID vaccine will cause death infertility, miscarriage, autism. So clearly we're not claiming any of those things. Claims that COVID-19 vaccine will make people who receive the magnetic which of course is truly absurd. We wouldn't dream of claiming that. That is totally ridiculous. Now let's move on to this site here another UK government website. Now one thing I want to quote from this website here and again check on the links for yourself this is the evidence I'm not making this up. This site says there's no evidence COVID-19 vaccine increases the risk of having a miscarriage preterm birth or other complications in your pregnancy. So that is direct from this government website here. And this site also says this the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain live virus and cannot give you a baby COVID-19. This is patently utterly true because they only cause the production of antigens based on the spike protein not the whole virus. So they couldn't possibly give a baby the infection that's truly scientifically ridiculous. Now this is the next site I want to look at here here COVID-19 in pregnancy. I want to highlight from this site is this research probably on the 25th of July by the UK Obstetrics Evalence System National cohort and I've left the hyperlink in there. I suggest that Delta variant is associated with an increased risk of severe illness amongst hospitalized pregnant women. So this site again direct quote from the government website. So I don't think we're saying anything that's wrong. I do hope not. That that site is saying that Delta variant is associated with an increased risk of severe illness. So there's an increased risk of severe illness amongst whom? amongst hospitalized pregnant women. That particular group compared with the alpha-wow type variant or previous waves. So this is talking about the risk in that Delta variant. Now let's just bring ourselves I was going to say bring ourselves up to date but the UK website on this hasn't been updated since the 22nd of July. Nevertheless BA 2.5 on the chron of course 3.4 percent BA 4 on the chron of course 17.2 percent BA 5 on the chron of course 78.7 percent others which could include Delta but I don't think it does actually they don't specify 0.7. So let's go to the more up-to-date data from the US CDC and just to make sure we're not getting anything wrong here. Delta variant CDC latest now cost cast data is oh the range here is between 0.0 percent and 0.0 percent so in the United States at least we can say that the prevalence of Delta is currently somewhere between 0.0 percent and 0.0 percent so quite why that site is recording Delta data is open to question but nevertheless we are simply reporting what the government website says. So that's the original claim we're talking about here the JVCI issues new advice so the JVCI JVCI has advised that pregnant woman should be offered the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as the rest of the population based on the mother's age and clinical risk group not based on the prioritization which was the case related to pregnancy. So this is the nature of the nature of the change. That was the evidence from the CDC on variants just to make sure up-to-date and that's the new advice that has been issued. Now the main reason I'm not going to quote this in detail but the main reason given here is that the main risk of severe outcomes in SARS-CoV-N-AIDS 2 infections related to age so older mothers will be at greater risk than younger mothers is what they're saying. So joint committee on vaccination and immunization again these are all direct quotes from the sites I don't think we're giving any misinformation here. Advises that it's preferable for pregnant women in the UK to be offered Pfizer, BioNTech or Moderna vaccine where available and then they go on to say there's no evidence that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women but more research is needed. So more research is needed but the idea that you would say to a pregnant woman well I'm going to give you this vaccine but there's no evidence such as just that it's unsafe for pregnant women more research is needed but well obviously we'll give it to you anyway it's just quite unthinkable isn't it. So quite widely say that anyway. That's what they say. Now the UK actually say that their information is coming from this site here the US data primarily but we'll look at that more in a minute let's go on here now. Public Health England's a green book now so this is the green book so the green book is the vaccination against disease, a book where all the information is given. It literally used to be green now it's green web pages where is it used to be a green a green book but anyway. Advises that pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccinating vaccination with their clinician. Now some people might say that's book passing I couldn't possibly comment on that but some people might think it's passing the book including the latest evidence on safety on which vaccines they should receive. So let's hope that the the the the clinician is bang up to date with the latest research and is able to give completely current advice on this as they are the absolute pinnacle of up to date knowledge we would hope. Professor Lim, COVID-19 Chair for JVCI we encourage pregnant women to discuss the risks and benefits with their clinician. There is more real world safety data from the US in relation to the Pfizer Moderna, Pfizer BioNTech Moderna vaccines in pregnant women who are pregnant. Therefore we advise a preference for these to be offered to pregnant women and that is based on this information it's based on this information here from the CDC where they're claiming which is a bit confusing because Professor Edward Morris, President of the Royal College of Obsessions and Gynecologists says that we are grateful the JVCI for taking consideration our evidence and updating the guidance around COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy. So whether it came from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or whether it came from this website is ambiguous from the data that we are given. Anyway Professor Morris goes on to say we believe it should be a woman's choice whether to have the vaccine or not after considering the benefits and risks. So after considering the benefits and risks and would encourage pregnant women to discuss with a trusted source like a GP as we say hopefully is banged up to date with all the data's research. Obstetrician who would hope is banged up to date with all the data's research having access to all of the available numerical data or midwives hopefully they've got access to all of the latest numerical data and fully understand it or a healthcare professional in the vaccination centre let's hope they're fully up to date with all new numerical data fully understand it and are able to communicate it clearly to the inquiring of pregnant woman. This move will empower all pregnant women in the UK to make the decision that is right for them. At the same time that non-pregnant population in their age group receive protection from the COVID-19 vaccination clearly reflecting the new guidelines indicating that there has been a change from this position here that pregnant women are no longer in a priority group for vaccination but it should be vaccinated according to their age and individual clinical risk. JVCI advice last week that as a precaution is preferable for people under the age of 30 with no underlying health conditions to be offered an alternative to our Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine where possible. Personally if I was vaccinating young women I would be uncomfortable. I'm uncomfortable vaccinating without Oxford AstraZeneca. Now we're also given advice on this site here related to the Green Book and other sites in the UK that we are to report side effects of vaccines that's this link here. If you get any side effects talk to your doctor pharmacist or nurse this includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflets which is on here. If you're concerned about any side effects you can report them directly on the yellow card scheme. So there we go that is the change. The change is essentially the changes to this from this. So that is the nature of the change and I'm not going to use words other than change to describe this change. So there we go clearly as we've said from the guidelines I'm actually operating under constraints at the moment. Here we have this is from my channel so that's me a few years ago. Channel violations active community guidelines strikes. I'm under warning at the moment which does concern me that's why I've been at pains to quote directly from all the government websites. So there we go but we can say definitively that there is this change because we've quoted that from the JVCI website itself. So that's the change and thank you for watching."
Cancer types post mRNA vaccines,COVID Updates,2024-06-22,4MPH0QD74Yw,"Today we're going to review a paper published not long ago that documented an unusual case of cancer immediately after vaccination, COVID-19 vaccination. And reason why I wanted to focus on this particular topic is because of the author's review of all literature documenting cancer development after vaccination, after mRNA vaccination, specifically also what might be the reasons as to why this is actually even being observed. So I thought this was super interesting. And it also supports the theory that we are in conjunction with other scientists proposed recently and published how mRNA vaccines via their genetic makeup could potentially be contributing to cancer development. All right, my name is Dr. Mikhail Orashek of Marginomics and let's get going with this. So first of all, there's a hakao is like in science papers, there's introduction and introduction, provides a really interesting little tidbits of information. And in this paper, the author or authors, I can remember how many were involved, and introduced this doctor, I think the name was something like Ute Kruger or something like that. Anyway, the reason why I bring it up is because that doctor apparently introduced the concept of terrible cancers. So she might have coined that term, but the reason why I mentioned this is because this is actually the first example of terrible cancers being used in a scientific literature that I'm aware of. And however, when I checked the reference for the authors use for this doctor when coding this term, it actually was an published paper at all. It was a video interview. So it's somewhat unprofessional to use a video interview as a reference in scientific literature. And by the way, in the pandemic, I'm seeing this trend more frequently. And it might be because of the fact that there was such a heavy-handed censorship of what kind of information was allowed to be published in scientific literature. But as a consequence, it might have actually resulted in this new trend where scientists are using non-scientific references. Not a professional way to do it, but nevertheless, I watched the video and the video was very good. So worth checking out. Anyway, that doctor also mentioned that she suspected that the reason why we are seeing this proliferation of terrible cancers might be because of the spike protein getting inside the nucleus, that's an old story right now. The paper that actually proposed that has been retracted since. I made a video on that topic. It is still the biggest, most watched video I ever made. And it really is the video that helped me launch this channel, really. But nevertheless, and there's other supporting evidence that suggests that indeed spike protein could be getting inside nucleus, but it's very weak evidence. But nevertheless, you can check out videos of that evidence because I made content on that. Then we move on to the actual, well actually the authors also mentioned this and the reason why we don't know anything really is because when the clinical trials were done, they were the actual, these gene therapy products, the mRNA, so-called mRNA vaccines, they were never actually investigated for the capacity of introducing same mutations in a genetic content or ability to produce cancers. Furthermore, the clinical trials were ended prematurely because everyone involved in those clinical trials, nearly everyone was allowed to vaccinate, nearly a few months after the clinical trials started. Therefore, we cannot measure the long-term consequences of vaccinations, which is how you would potentially be able to start determining whether indeed such a procedure was dangerous for cancer development or not. Okay, so that's a problem. And then the authors go on to present the case themselves, which is what spurred them producing this article and they presented a case of a young, young woman, third-year-old woman who was very healthy and had an athletic lifestyle and who started to have bad symptoms immediately after second, her second shot, a mRNA shot. The first one was she was fine after the second one. Literally next day she started to have certain symptoms. The weird one was like this neck and jaw lock. She started sweating, she started to have like fever. I think she like tremors and nausea, just not feeling good and that it progressed into even worst case scenario. She started to have insomnia and hypersensitivity to light and sound. So really unusual cases. And eventually, she was actually diagnosed with, I think they called it precursor b-cell lymphoma. So basically cells that are precursor b-cells and basically those cells were being them. They were dividing uncontrollably. So because of that, she was treated with chemotherapy and everything worked out just fine for her. So that's great. But it also then authors decided to see, well, how common is this? And they checked published literature on this topic. And basically, what they discovered is that there's so far up to that point. And this is a recent publication. So up to that point of them submitting the paper, let's say, and that usually can take several months between submission for publication and when the paper is actually finally allowed to be seen. So then within probably the first two to three years of mass vaccination, 28 cases. They found 28 published reports of cancers after immediately after mass vaccination. And basically, out of those 28, 26 of them were in either blood or lymph tissues. So they refer to them as he, he, hemato lymphoma cancers. So basically affecting either your lymph nodes, lymph liquid and or blood. And two of them were solid tumors. Of these 26 affecting blood and and lymph tissues, I think something like nine of them were specifically affecting b-cells. 11 were affecting t-cells. Additional, I think it was six that were affecting myeloid lines. So basically cell line that is a precursor to formation of blood. And two more were like I mentioned in solid, solid again, out of all of those 28, four were in the actual injection site, including one of those solid tumor ones. So that's that's also pretty interesting. One more thing to mention is that most of these are either lymphomas or leukemias that are being observed. And basically the difference here is that, oh, it started to snow. Great. Basically, the difference is the origin, right? So leukemia will originate in a bone marrow versus lymphoma, will originate in lymph nodes, but same cell lines could be targeted either way. So and the reason why that was of interest to me is because we recently published a paper review where I'm the lead author suggesting that IGG for antibodies could be contributing to cancer as well in their own right. And based on historical studies of people with diseases that have elevated IGG for levels, we mentioned that leukemias could be like the signature cancers that need to be looked for. So we're talking about specifically, yeah, these type of cell lines being affected. So there is clearly some background information. This is probably the best review I've seen summarizing all of this, which is why I wanted to bring this to your attention. But how the authors finalized this was basically giving us suggestions as to what might be causing all of these. Why are we seeing cancers after vaccination? And by the way, some of these show up very quick, like within few days after, after vaccination. So very rapid onset. Most of them are denoval. And that means basically there was never a history of any kind. There was no prior cancer. It just shows up out of no work type of thing. And so you can see there's definitely this suggests that there could be some sort of a positive effect. So now let's talk about the potential causes that the authors proposed. Because this was very, very fascinating as well. So number one, they're talking about the potential of vaccines inducing these molecules called PD1 on or PDL one on the surface of immune cells. We distanced PD1 sense for program death one. I talked about this extensively now in multiple videos. But basically when you have these molecules on the surface of your immune cells, it signals these molecules basically to no longer work as effectively. So they're going to be shut off. This is part of what is referred to this induction of this concept of called T cell exhaustion. So check out some of the past videos where I've talked about this already as well. And I went deeply into this topic in my turbo cancer videos as well. So that was the first one. The second one was the possibility of the spike protein of interacting with tumor suppressor proteins. So proteins in our body in our cells that normally are supposed to make sure that cancers do not develop. Hence the tumor suppressor. So P53 protein is one of them. Braka one is another one or Braka two. So these are important proteins in our body that work in such way to make sure that cancers do not develop. And apparently spike protein there is now some supporting evidence that spike protein could be interacting with these proteins and perhaps limiting their proper function. So there is that element as well. Number three is that mRNA vaccinations interferes with proper signaling of this important immolaculaculant interference. So interference signaling is suppressed. Again I went into great deep detail about this topic in one of my videos where I reviewed how the genetic makeup of vaccines could be leading into cancer. So please check that out as well. So then next one that I mentioned that I've never discussed yet was this really interesting concept that binding of the spike protein to the ACE2 receptor can actually trigger cells that have this interaction into certain type of cells into producing this compound called transformation growth factor. And this molecule, this transformation growth factor as it names and just it can induce cells to transform into something else. So these cells that actually say are triggered by this molecule can regress in their state. So from whatever they are already as a mature developed cell that can regress almost like backwards in their development and to a type of state of cell that would have been seen earlier in the embryonic development. And such cells are now have the capacity for example to grow into to develop into something else and to metastasize. So this could help for example create that dangerous negative environment towards cancer development. All right. Number five is DNA contamination. Remember there's now some emerging say rumors that that the mRNA vaccines both Moderna and Pfizer were contaminated with with Bacteria Plasmid DNA and while there's still no deep scientific investigation of this that I'm aware of in terms of published literature this such as that perhaps such DNA contamination could be contributing to to cancer development. If such fragments were to insert into our the genome of ourselves in an incorrect place for example in a place where the genetic code is supposed to code for those tumor suppressor proteins while if you disrupt that code and you disrupt production of such proteins again he could be you could be inducing cancer development. All right. So number six was the IGG for antibodies. Of course that's my baby and recently I did a video of my own review on how IGG for antibodies could be inducing cancer development. So please check that out and finally number seven is frame shifting. I asked that if video on frame shifting is the idea where because of the genetic content of these vaccines how the mRNA is supposed to be translated meaning decoded by the machinery inside the cell to produce a protein of ventures. In this case of course the protein of ventures being the spike protein that can be slipped up and you don't produce spike protein you produce something completely else some gibberish protein and that could actually cause problems in terms of how information is then being interpreted. So I thought this was really a cool way to to give you a great summary of basically what might be happening with with with cancers post mRNA vaccination. And if they and it's also one of the first papers that actually talked about like that like we have a lot of anecdotal evidence suggesting that cancers especially turbo cancers are being seen all over the world and that's not really properly documented scientifically. So it was nice to actually see some scientific paper at least acknowledging that this at least these rumors do exist and that oncologist all over the world are discussing this but really we don't have a very solid yet scientific evidence. So this is at least potentially a start of this trend where we finally going to be documenting this information in a proper manner. All right I'm gonna wrap it up right here and I'm just gonna mention that please subscribe to the channel if you haven't already please hit that like button please leave a comment what you think and and what kind of content you're interested in and as a please check out our patron account as well where we produce additional content that does not make it to the YouTube video and wow this might be the last snowfall I'm gonna go into film this year but who knows bye everyone."
Kobach sues Pfizer over COVID vaccine claims,KSN TV,2024-06-17,NFcavo_ncFY,"Kansas is suing Pfizer over how it marketed its COVID-19 vaccine. In the lawsuit, Kansas Attorney General Chris Kobach alleges the vaccine maker misled the public about the risk of the shot. He also says Pfizer suggested the shot stopped the spread of COVID, then said it never studied if it actually did or not. Kobach says the lawsuit comes down to Pfizer allegedly withholding information and deceiving the public and says companies are obligated to be honest. And our Kansas Consumer Protection Act is all about that. It's about you do not deceive consumers. And you especially must not deceive consumers when consumers are making an urgent, frantic decision believing that their life might be on the line. Kansas is the first state of several to file a suit. In response to the allegation, Pfizer said in part quote, the representations made by Pfizer about its COVID-19 vaccine have been accurate and science based. The company believes that the state's case has no merit and will respond to the suit in due course."
Blood Clots after COVID Vaccine,Medicine with Dr. Moran,2021-12-11,It7VNzhAqOs,"Hello, welcome to my channel, Medicine with Dr. Maureen. I'm Dr. Keith Maureen. Today I want to talk about additional research in regards to vaccine-induced thrombosis, which has been well-documented with the adenoviral vector vaccines, in other words, the AstraZeneca and J&J. It's highly likely to be present in the other adenoviral vector vaccines such as the Russian vaccine Sputnik. I have previously talked about the possible pathophysiology of how these adenovirus vector vaccines lead to blood clots and ultimately low platelets. Now low platelets occur through a mechanism where the platelets get consumed in the clots so when we measure the platelet values, they're quite low. Now this condition is similar to what we call happen-induced blood clots and low platelets. One is a blood thinner that we use to prevent and treat blood clots. Now this week some new additional information on the pathophysiology of vaccine-induced blood clots was reported in the Journal of Science Advances. There's a link to the research paper in the description below. Now understanding how the mechanism that is, how these vaccines induce blood clots, which can be fatal, is important not just to prevent the outcome but also to treat it. We also need to understand this because we use adenovirus viral vectors to deliver treatments. Now just a quick recap on this particular condition, the frequency is on the order of 1 in 30,000 to about 1 in 100,000. A review at the end of July in the Journal of Blood reviewed the United Kingdom experience with AstraZeneca and the US experience with J&J up to sometime in July. As you can see on the slide, there are a number of cases of cerebral vein thrombosis. This is an unusual kind of blood clot that we can see involving the veins of the brain and these veins drain the brain and of course if you get blood clots in there it will not drain the brain properly. It's an unusual diagnosis, I must say I've only managed a couple of people with this in my 30 year career. Blood clots also were being found in other areas which were not usual, including the abdominal blood vessels. The majority of the blood clots were seen after the first dose, 18 percent of people in the UK group died and 11 in the US group, so pretty significant mortality. Now previous studies which I've reported on previously highlight the role of platelet factor 4 which we know is what happens with this heprin induced blood clotting. It can occur in veins as well as arteries just like the vaccine induced condition I'm talking about. Here's the research paper. The research you studied three different adenovirus vectors which have been deployed as vaccination vectors in the different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This model of the AstraZeneca viral vector they had to determine. They had to elucidate where there might be binding with platelet factor 4 and how it actually would bind and whether it was plausible. The ultimately showed that the adenovirus vector combined with platelet factor 4 via an electrostatic interaction something like something electrically positive joining with something electrically negative. In other words, opposite subtracting. They showed that a stable complex gets formed with the vector and platelet factor 4. Now platelet factor 4 is only present in the bloodstream. So this kind of interaction does not occur in muscle cells where the vaccine might be. They did look at a common medication called fondaparionics which is an anticoagulant that I've used many times for both acute coronary syndrome such as heart attacks as well as blood clots in the leg and the lung and they found that this medication reduces the number of binding events with the adenovirus vector surface from AstraZeneca and platelet factor 4. So it ablates this electronegative potential between there and inhibits the binding suggesting that this might be a plausible treatment. Now their study was performed in test tubes on the bench in the laboratory, not in humans, but they did show the platelet factor 4 does contact the surface of this adenovirus vector when allowed to freely move around in simulations. Vaccine induced blood clots typically occur 5 to 24 days after vaccination which is the time frame where you're going to get an antibody response. Now complete elucidation of what truly happens has not been worked out but this schematic provides the best evidence that we have as to what's happening so far. Now first someone will get vaccinated and somehow the vector enters the bloodstream either by an injection that does not truly go into the muscle. In other words it goes into a small blood vessel directly due to injection technique or more specifically lack of aspiration and the needle is actually in the blood vessel when the injection occurs. If there's damage to tiny capillary blood vessels as the needle is inserted where small amounts of the vaccine might be able to gain access to the bloodstream even though the vaccine might be placed correctly into the deltoid muscle. This could be the case as well. Perhaps there's another mechanism which I haven't thought of where some vaccine particles can actually access the bloodstream. Then in schematic 2 as you can see there is that electrostatic positive and negative attraction of platelet factor 4 to the vector. The complex then gets engulfed by other cells because they see it as being foreign, they send it to one ear lymph nodes which then stimulates the B cells in the lymph nodes to generate anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies or antibodies against the whole complex. These antibodies then activate platelets and a number of factors are released which causes more platelets to clump together and more platelet factor 4. Ultimately it causes clot formation and thus the syndrome of vaccine induced blood clots and low platelets. Again the platelets are low because all of the platelets are bound within the clot and they're not freely circulating in the bloodstream. Now this is important research for many reasons as I mentioned earlier. This key feature is that this happens in the bloodstream and while we can't definitively say that this happens due to vaccination technique it could certainly be. It's obviously important when injecting the needle into the deltoid muscle that you deliver the vaccine into the muscle and not into a tiny blood vessel. As I mentioned previously on this particular video this does happen based on surveys of nurses that have given intramuscular injections over the years. Many of them have said that they have aspirated blood just before they're about to inject the intramuscular injection and so they always check before they inject. Now it would be terrible to find out down the road that this is something to do with side effects that's the lack of aspiration when it could have been preventable. Of course we don't know that that's definitely the cause. There's lots of vaccinations going on and a randomized trial would be interesting and could definitively answer the question it wouldn't be that difficult to do. You would obviously need a lot of patients given the low frequency of the side effects involved but of course we are vaccinating a lot of people right now. I have told my patients who have encouraged vaccination to make sure that they ask the person doing the vaccination to aspirate before injection. It's such a small accommodation of only about three seconds. It makes me think about all the requests that my patients often ask me for, reasonable requests. I think of things like medications that they may or may not want before a procedure or at other times. Sometimes they have requests of getting them positioned in a certain spot for their endoscopy just before I'm about to sedate them. They might want an extra pillow or a pillow between their knees to make sure that their back is comfortable while they're asleep for 20 minutes. If their accommodations are reasonable and not harmful I always follow their wishes. Often it doesn't take any additional time but it shows that I care. It shows people that I'm listening to them and it allows for shared decision making which is crucial in the doctor patient relationship. It ultimately means that they will be happy and so will I. Asking for someone to aspirate before injecting as I did before both of my vaccinations is not much to ask for even if it's not the usual way that the vaccinator might perform their task. Healthcare providers should always be receptive to those that they're delivering care to. Being inflexible or emphatic in their beliefs and deciding that it's their way or the highway so to speak that has no place in medicine. Thanks for joining me today on medicine with Dr. Mourin. I'm Dr. Keith Mourin. Get healthy and stay healthy."
Kansas sues Pfizer alleging it ‘misled’ the public about safety of COVID vaccine,Fox Business,2024-06-17,o9nnVD8aeMg,"Well, the state of Kansas hitting the big farmers Pfizer with a lawsuit claiming the company quote, misled the public that it had a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Even though it knew it was connected to serious adverse events, I'm quoting there, it hid that information from the public. Kansas Attorney General Chris Kobach says that Pfizer violated the state's Consumer Protection Act and he joins us now. It's so great to have you on the program to talk about this finally. All these years after there were vaccine mandates and that was something that this, you know, administration really pushed hard. For us, for those of us who wanted to come to work and weren't necessarily on board, you had to get a shot or you couldn't make a living. So there's a lot at stake here and I want you to just kind of lay out the case that you're making. Yeah, you present a great scenario. Some employers mandated the vaccine. Other people had to make a decision whether they wanted to get the vaccine or not. And when people made that decision to get the vaccine, then they had to make a choice. And people made that choice very quickly with anxiety under, you know, many people who chose to get the vaccine did so sensing that it was urgent and they had to do it for their own safety. And in that situation, it was crucial that the pharmaceutical companies speak truthfully and present all information that they have. And this consumer protection suit against Pfizer is based on the fact that they had information that was contrary to what they were saying publicly. And I can just give you two examples. One is for pregnant women. Pfizer stated and advertised that it was that the vaccine was safe for pregnant women. But as early as October of 2020, they had evidence from a study that they did on rats showing real complications for pregnancy. And then in February of 2021, they had information from 458 women who took the Pfizer vaccine and the majority of them had complications relating to pregnancy. And then the other one is myocarditis. The CEO of Pfizer publicly stated that there was no link between any myocarditis and the COVID vaccine when in fact, they knew that there was a link. So it's, you know, the bottom line is people need can't be lied to. This suit isn't about, you know, someone suing the company for a given me AG, but didn't the federal government essentially give them the golden keys of immunity from prosecution when developing not just Pfizer, but all the pharma companies that were working to, I'm just wondering if we should be suing the federal government instead of Pfizer because they were given this free, easy way to make money, not having to worry about lawsuits. Well, one could certainly argue that the federal government's hands weren't clean either, but the federal government did give them immunity from suits, from tort lawsuits, from a person who was injured from the vaccine suing the company. However, the federal government did not give them liability if they committed a deceptive or misleading practice in advertising their product to consumers. And that's what the basis of this suit is. We also want to get to this while we have you, AG, you've taken up the fight against Biden's student loan bailouts, but earlier this month, a judge shot you down along with seven other states. In his ruling, he claimed, quote, these plaintiffs simply have no skin in the game. Their answer to Justice Scalia's colloquial expression of standing, what's it to you is this? It's nothing. Your reaction. Yeah, so that case is still in front of the judge. We have a coalition of states and the judge said that three states had enough skin in the game, if you will, and that the rest of the states, Kansas, included only had the loss of tax revenue. And the judge said that wasn't enough injury to the states. We disagree with that particular holding, but the case continues and we're awaiting a decision on a preliminary injunction motion from that judge, which we hope to see before the end of the month. So the case is very much alive. The question is just which states have standing. But the big picture here, the one that we cannot forget is the Supreme Court already, we all thought, decided in Nebraska versus Biden that the president of the United States, without the approval of Congress, could not be spending hundreds of billions of dollars on essentially a move to become, you know, to use it as campaign cash to get the young voters for them. And they mixed it, but he went ahead, he keeps going ahead and doing essentially the same thing. Can't you formulate another Nebraska versus Biden lawsuit against the federal government, against Biden in particular? Yeah, that's exactly what this Kansas lawsuit is leading a coalition of states. We're basically telling the court, hey, look, the Supreme Court in Nebraska versus Biden already said you can't do this. Now their Department of Education under Biden is just tweaking it a little bit and saying, OK, how about if we forgive the same thing this way? And so we're having to, it's virtually the same thing. So we're bringing the same claims against this slight variation of what they did the first time. Well, I thought the Supreme Court had the last word, but I guess the Biden minister, you would think is all right. You would think. Attorney General Chris Callback, thank you very much for being here. Appreciate it. My pleasure."
COVID-19 Vaccine Myths Debunked,Life Noggin,2021-03-25,qt44rum2_vc,"Hey there, welcome to Life Noggin. After a long year, scientists have developed and begun to distribute vaccines for COVID-19, a virus that has already claimed over 2 million lives worldwide. While most people consider the vaccine a cause for celebration, there are some people who still have lingering worries about vaccine safety, necessity, and contents. So let's set the record straight and bust some of the myths surrounding the COVID-19 vaccines. Myth number one, nearly 30 percent of Americans believe the vaccine is a clever ruse by Bill Gates to implant microchips. This myth got started after Gates made a comment about something he thinks might happen in the future, digital certificates. They're sort of like digital tattoos that in the future could be given to people after they get vaccinated or tested for COVID-19. But Gates' idea has nothing to do with the vaccines themselves, which don't have any digital technology at all. So let's be clear, there are no microchips in any of the vaccines. They also don't contain tracking devices, and while we're at it, they were not developed using fetal tissue. Myth number two, vaccines contain the coronavirus so they can give you COVID-19. Nothing can be further from the truth. None of the current vaccines contain the coronavirus, so it's impossible to get COVID-19 from them. Myth number three, coronavirus vaccines can alter or rewrite your DNA. Two of the vaccines being administered across the US contain messenger RNA, also known as mRNA. DNA is used to make mRNA, and mRNA is used to make proteins. The process only goes one direction, so mRNA cannot go backwards to affect your DNA. In fact, the mRNA in vaccines doesn't even get to the nucleus. The part of your body cells where your DNA is stored. Instead, the mRNA in coronavirus vaccines tells your body to make a protein called the spike protein that fools your body into thinking it's seeing the coronavirus. Your immune system reacts by making antibodies to the spike protein, which is part of the coronavirus. So if you do encounter a real coronavirus, your body is ready to fight it off and you won't get sick. Myth number four, coronavirus vaccines can cause infertility or miscarriage. This myth comes from a misunderstanding about spike proteins. Turns out there are many types of spike proteins. One of them, since side in one, is involved with the development of the placenta. But this is a completely different spike protein from the one found on the coronavirus and created by vaccines. The vaccines have no effect on the spike protein on the placenta. Most importantly, actual studies of the vaccines found no evidence that they affect fertility or cause miscarriages. Myth number five, the FDA process for approving COVID-19 vaccines was rushed and incomplete. The process was certainly fast, but it was not rushed and no steps were skipped. The vaccines went through the same rigorous testing process as every other vaccine has in the past and were deemed safe and effective. The speed is thanks to an unprecedented worldwide collaboration and investment to develop a vaccine quickly. But the clinical trials and review process were done carefully and showed both safety and effectiveness. Myth number six, the vaccines will make me sick. Well, this has some truth in it because when the vaccine works, it fools your body into thinking it's seeing the coronavirus. When your immune system reacts, it can give you symptoms like you might have on the first day or two of a real infection, like fever, muscle aches and chills, but they don't last long, unlike a real coronavirus infection. Myth number seven, I don't need the vaccine because I've already had COVID-19. Actually, experts still recommend that you get the vaccine even if you've had the infection. There just isn't enough evidence yet to say how long you're protected from getting COVID-19 again once you've been infected. Early studies found that it may not be for long. So if you have had COVID-19, ask your healthcare provider when you should get your COVID-19 vaccine. And finally, because scientists are unsure if vaccinated people can spread the virus, you should wear a mask, keep your distance and wash your hands even after you receive the vaccine until most people are vaccinated.

Also in the description, you'll find all the sources we used to bust these myths. So do you plan on getting the COVID-19 vaccine? And if you have had it already, what was your experience? Let me know in the comments section below. Thank you so much to our friends over at Hollywood Health and Society for sponsoring this video.

Two very rare COVID vaccine side effects detected in global study of 99 million | The Guardian,GBNews,2024-02-22,SkcAZfrYYXM,"OK, we're going to finish with the Guardian now. How have you been back in the news, Lear? Yeah, bad time of cough. I thought you were doing it deliberately. No, so two very rare COVID vaccine side effects have been detected in a global study of 99 million people. So these are new COVID vaccine side effects, a neurological disorder, and inflammation of the spinal cord that have been detected by researchers in the largest vaccine safety study to date. The results confirm how uncommon known complications are as researchers confirm benefits from vaccines still outweigh the risk. So some people are getting sick from the vaccines, but it's still overall they're saying it's better than you're going to let the less chance to get an L than if you don't want to get COVID. But they don't give numbers. They don't say, you know, oh, this many people died from COVID, and this many people died from spinal inflammation caused by the vaccine. But at least we are hearing more about people who have had bad side effects to the vaccine. For a long while, that was just, you know, a hashtag. It was a conspiracy theory. Like all right, when conspiracy theories is 100 percent true, and you can trust all of them. But of course the scale of it is the question isn't it? You know, so a lot of people will say that the scale is immense, and it probably isn't immense, but it is real, and people have lost loved ones as a result of it. It's worth talking about, isn't it? Yeah, and we don't need to focus on the severe effects. There are a lot of moderate effects that have effectively disabled people that were previously very healthy. And of course this has been undertaken by the Global Vaccine Data Network, which sounds to me like they're marking their own test paper here to some degree. They're going to be within the industry. Now I'm not suggesting that we should all go conspiracy theory on this, but we should... Leo always wants to. However, we should be open about it, because there are people being massively affected by them."
COVID lawsuit: Utah mom says AstraZeneca vaccine disabled her | Cuomo,NewsNation,2024-05-14,-b_Fxch2umI,"She says her life went from being the picture of health to a shadow of her former self. I want to bring in Brienne right now and her lawyer, Aaron Seary, because I have a question for him too. Brienne, I want people to understand what is happening and why you're doing this. Thank you for being with us. But I'm customarily. I will ignore council as much as I can, but not this time. Aaron, I have a question. As a lawyer, is Brienne at all compromised in her ability to go after AstraZeneca because she volunteered for a clinical trial as opposed to just being someone like me or you who got it when it was made available to the public and we were told to take it? Now, I don't think that compromises her at all. I think she's subject to the same restrictions on bringing lawsuits for the most part that you, Chris or anybody else that was injured from a COVID vaccine. And that's the prep act. That's the federal government explicitly giving the vaccine manufacturers immunity for any injury that occurred from the COVID vaccine. And they didn't just do it by the way. After the vaccine came out, they freed Gabi Mini. They gave that immunity to them before they even developed the vaccine and did so contractually as well as doing this so by law. Right. Now, look, we know what that debate is going to be. I think it's a good one to have, which is, well, they were asking us to rush it says the companies, you know, ordinarily, we would have taken longer so we needed some type of protection. Let's put it to the side. Brienne, you look great. So explain to the audience, what are you actually dealing with and how has life changed for you so much that you feel you need to litigate this? Well, you know, the easiest way to explain this is that it's an invisible illness. I mean, we all look fine, right? We're not in a wheelchair. We still have hair. You know, we can still smile and communicate sometimes clearly. But the reality is is I am in pain every second of every day. Unfortunately, I have a severe progressive neuropathy that will continue to progress until my life is done. It's something that is a very sharp, tingling electrical sensation and it corpses through my body 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But in addition to that, I have the tinnitus like Sean does. I have the food sensitivities. I'm completely dependent on other people in my home. I have, at the time, I had a six and eight year old kid and their lives, you know, our lives revolved around them. Mom took care of everything for them. But now, unfortunately, everything revolves around mom. They have to figure out if mom can help them that day with their homework. If mom can make them breakfast, if mom's going to be able to get out of bed, is mom going to be able to take them to school? These are all very simple tasks that people take for granted. But when your health is robbed from you, you know, those things are now things that you have to prioritize from one day to the next, depending on how your body is doing. When you reported this set of events to the company, what was the response? Silence. It's that simple. It was silence. I thought that they were going to be there to help me. In my contract, they stayed it explicitly, that they will be there to help me financially as well as medically. And they didn't either. It's as if they couldn't get away from me fast enough after I reported my injury. I'm nothing more than a number to them, to be totally honest. Well, it's hard to feel otherwise when they didn't reach out, right? What are the messages does it send? Well, look, let me give you a little dirty secret that I'm sure Aaron explained to you about litigation. He's about time and who has the most time and who has the resources to extend time. What I can do here in the media is promise you, I don't forget. Okay? I don't forget. So until this ends, we're always a phone call away. I'm not saying that everything you say is right and everything is right. I got to look at everything. But I will say this. I will follow the process to its conclusion. And AstraZeneca, you are going to get a suggestion to come on this show. And I want to understand why you wouldn't have even reached out to somebody who you'd made a deal with. Brian, we are here for the duration and I wish you the best with your family. Council, we're always a call away for any developments that you believe are instructive of the process.

Neurological disorders & COVID-19 vaccines,VJNeurology,2021-10-01,pQXq9YbXXYM,"There is a lot of debate on this, you know, because the vaccines we use for COVID are in vaccines that cause the expression of the spike protein in the host. So the spike protein is implicated also in some of the immune reactions that we see during COVID infection. So it is not just the envelope, the envelope plays a minima role, the viral envelope. It is mainly the spike. So I think that we have had two conditions developing. People based on the fact that some people experience long COVID features, so long-term problems after COVID infection. Also people are after the vaccine in some cases. I've had manifestations that resemble those we have seen in the long COVID-sofatigue, paresthesia. This may be linked also to the activation of the flammatory responses, lymphocytes, cytokines that after the virus and also after the vaccine may actually trigger some interaction with the brain function with the peripheral nervous system, for instance. But it was perceived that the vaccine is actually quite safe as there is no evidence of long-term effect after vaccination except for a few cases of Guillain Barre syndrome who developed people who developed GDS, which is quite a specific, I think, but it's also expression of an abnormally immune response in individuals which are relatively well-sensitive or to inflammation."
Some Health Care Workers Choosing Not To Get Covid Vaccine,NBC News,2021-07-29,0UHCFPDhrEI,"Show of hands. How many of you have gotten a COVID vaccine? These are four healthcare workers from different hospitals in North Carolina. Why not? We don't know what the long-term side effects are. It also hasn't been proven to be effective. The CDC and many public health experts say that it's more than 90 percent effective. They do say that. That hasn't proven to me to be true. I'm not going to just jump on a bandwagon with something that has not been tested. When you say that it hasn't been tested, it has been tested, though. But not to the, if you look at the normal, the normal year span of how long something is tested, it's usually 12 to 14 years before it comes to humans. Across the country, about one in four healthcare workers still is vaccinated against COVID. From North Carolina to Texas to New York, anti-manda protests are mounting. I don't trust it right now. So is the pushback. This is in the category of give me a bleeping break. When did everyone get a medical degree? For weeks, we've spoken with many overworked healthcare workers who practically begged Americans to get the shot. What do you tell people who just don't believe you? It's frustrating. Not these. They say they're not anti-vax, more anti-mandate. And I'm not comfortable putting something into my body until I am ready. If and when I'm ready to get the vaccine, I will get it on my own accord. I won't be forced. You just don't trust the CDC. I do not trust the CDC. Absolutely not. And that fuels their skepticism. I have the right to question anybody in this country. I want a question. You're entitled to your opinion, but these are facts. Are they though? Are they facts? Lester, more than 40,000 people participated in the Pfizer clinical trial alone, but those workers are among the many, were not convinced.

The key moments when Dr. Anthony Fauci contradicted himself during heated COVID hearing,New York Post,2024-06-04,XMTYBPqIM-I,"You said in an interview that you gave as part of an audio book written by Michael Specter that you believed an institutional should make it hard for people to live their lives so they'd feel pressured to get vaccinated. Can we run the audio clip on that please? Do you think can be done about it? I have to say that I don't see a big solution other than some sort of mandatory vaccination. I know federal officials don't like to use that term. Once people feel empowered and protected legally, you are going to have schools, universities, and colleges, I'm going to say you want to come to this college buddy, you're going to get vaccinated. Lady, you're going to get vaccinated. Big corporations like Amazon and Facebook and all of those others are going to say you want to work for us, you get vaccinated. And it's been proven that when you make it difficult for people in their lives, they lose their ideological bulls**t and they get vaccinated. Thank you. Are all objections to COVID vaccinations, ideological bulls**t, Dr. Pouchy? No, they're not and they're not what I was referring to. Well, in reference to making it hard for people to get education, traveling, working, I'd say it very much was in context."
Do Americans who questioned COVID vaccine deserve an apology? | On Balance,NewsNation,2024-02-21,YVFAvoeFahI,"Dr. Bredjarr is here, former assistant secretary for health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It's good to see you, Admiral, as always. Upon reflection, do a lot of Americans and people who are concerned about the vaccine deserve an apology? Absolutely. I believe they do. We approach this. You have to be open with people. We knew very early on that there was an increase in the heart inflammation, myocarditis, much more with a couple of the vaccines versus Pfizer. But this very large study of about 100 million people shows that there are rare neurologic effects, there are rare immunofax, and there are the heart inflammation. And these are legitimate concerns. We have to be open with people that, you know, if you're 70 years old or 75, yeah, in that risk, you should be getting the boosters. But if you're 25 and healthy, particularly a male, and you've had COVID before, that risk of myocarditis is about the same, or maybe even a little bit higher than you're risk of having a serious outcome. So yes, people deserve an apology. I think open, honest, scientific discussion was crushed, and even I myself had a tweet a band because I simply stated the fact, proven by data, that those who were naturally immune to go ahead COVID, should not lose their jobs, should not need passports, should not need other things, because they were equally immune as those who got the vaccine and the Delta outbreak. It's fair, it's stunning to me always, the banning and sort of the stifling of free speech, because it was the ideas were somehow scary to the orthodoxy or somehow took away the power of the institutions. To that end was so much trust lost in our institutions and in public health. CDC and NIH seemed to just be doubling down in their arrogance. Nope, we weren't wrong, no, we were completely right. Misinformation is this huge problem. Why do you think they refuse to learn and apologize to what is always a pretty forgiving American public? You know, I think there's some pathology there because one of the first principles of being a physician as I am is to be honest with your patient and to respect their autonomy. You provide the best information you can and you let them make a decision. We're not in a paternalistic society where we force people to have an operation or force people to take vaccines. We give them the information and that is, I think, the most important lesson that public health officials need to learn. Get back to basics. Tell the truth, be honest. American people are smart. They could handle the truth. Don't try to wipe, wash it or coerce people as Dr. Fauci clearly did on a number of occasions and let Americans make their own decision. I was surprised to learn that it was a former FDA commissioner but who was then a board member of Pfizer getting the band for simply saying that natural immunity is powerful. How deep and corrupt the system goes? Wow. Yeah, I remember those times there were wild memoir of the pandemic is your book. And I think it's really important that you go into these issues, you deal with them honestly, you've been one of the people from the very beginning. I think we had the courage to say, hey, we don't know what we don't know, which unfortunately came very difficult to so many people to say. Good to see you Admiral, as always, thank you.

Covid-19 vaccine: Is Bill Gates implanting us with 5G microchips? • FRANCE 24 English,FRANCE 24 English,2021-07-19,_o2C_KujcB4,"The spill gates want to implant us all with 5G microchips alongside the COVID-19 vaccine. Internet users have accused the billionaire of deliberately spreading the virus in order to control the world's population using geolocalized 5G microchips. And celebrities haven't been immune to spreading the rumors. In May 2020, the French actress Juliet Binoche shared with her 300,000 Instagram followers the following message. These are operations, international finance groups, mostly American, have been organizing for years. They're manipulating us without wanting to sound paranoid. The vaccines they're working on are a part of it. No to microchip implants for everyone. No to Bill Gates' operations. No to 5G. This is completely false. It's a conspiracy theory that's concocted from a deliberate mix of three separate initiatives financed by the Bill and Millinda Gates Foundation. Firstly, there's the race to find a vaccine against COVID, a scientific endeavor to which Bill Gates has donated $250 million since the start of the pandemic. Then there's the Digital ID 2020 project which aims to provide the world's estimated one billion undocumented people with digital ID and health cards. And finally, research conducted by MIT to inject vaccines in a special ink subcutaneously, a sort of tattoo that can only be seen using infrared light and can tell who is and isn't vaccinated. Now those three projects do all exist, but they have nothing to do with each other. And what's more, injectable GPS trackers are technologically far-fetched as the microchips still require rechargeable batteries to be picked up by satellites. So unless you want to lug another battery and charger around, you'll just have to rely on your telephone and not your vaccine to keep track of your movements."
RFK Jr. and Bill Maher Debate Vaccines | Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO),Real Time with Bill Maher,2024-04-26,LBP6P12oyzM,"But your vice presidential pick wants to recall the Moderna vaccine. That's the one I got. She's not going to... Do you agree with that? Recall it. I think the... I make those vaccines need to... We need to have, again, true double-blind placebo-controlled trials on that. There's 25 percent of Americans who believe that they know somebody who has killed a COVID vaccine killed, killed. 25 percent of Americans, 52 percent of Americans believe that the vaccines are causing injuries, including death, 52 percent. Oh, if you look at the clinical trial studies, the actual studies that were done that were released, of the Pfizer vaccine, Moderna has not released it. If you look at the Pfizer vaccine, there were 22,000 people in the placebo group and 22,000 people who got the actual vaccine. And the people who got the vaccine had a 23 percent higher death rate from all causes. At the end of that study. But that could not be the disease itself? No, well... Because we know the... If it is, and the vaccine doesn't work, that's... Well, it's certainly... You're welcome. Well, no, no. That's not... Not true at all. And I'm somebody who did not want the vaccine and didn't think I should have been made to get it. But it does work. I think it all... It all... Wait a minute, wait a minute. Work in the sense that if you were... Many people who would have died because they were not in good health. It killed mostly the obese and the very elderly. Okay, those people... How are we talking about that? They... Those people are alive today, I think, because of the vaccine. I... Okay. I think that's the truth. Does it also... Does it also have complications? Yes, I mean anecdotally, I've not heard about one out of four people dying, but I know a lot of people who had issues. I'm sorry. Yes, but they could have had worse issues if they got the disease. That's the thing. Medicine is always... So, I just... Let's make it a case-by-case basis. Certainly... Well, I agree with that, I believe that people want the vaccine. Yeah. But they should be able to get it. I'm not any vaccine. What I say is that... Well, people think you are. Well, I know, but that's because I'm called that, because there's a way of silencing me. But I have said for 17 years, I'm not any vaccine. I just want good science. I want people should be able to make informed choices. I am against vaccine mandates. Why can't... I am too. Why does vaccines work?"
Covid vaccine arrives in UK with rollout to start next week | ITV News,ITV News,2020-12-03,DaoxYJBs1z4,"They rode through the tunnel from Belgium, not on horseback, but in articulated lorries. At some point today, maybe in these very vehicles, the cavalry arrived in the UK, bringing nearly a million doses of vaccine. As they were driven to a secret location, government scientists taught the studios to reassure us it's safe. Absolutely no corners have been cut by the MHRA in their assessment of this vaccine and we've completely left them alone to do all the same assurance steps at their own time just as normal. The first batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines arrived today. They are being taken to a secure public health England depot and further checks will be carried out. It will then be distributed to 50 designated hospital hubs across all four nations and the first vaccines will be given on Tuesday. Scotland will get 65,000 doses, many of which will go to care home residents. Its government is confirmed with the regulators approval it can be moved and split into smaller batches. Both of which makes this vaccine more usable with minimum wastage for care home residents and for our older citizens. So in effect we can take the vaccine to them or close to them and we will begin that exercise from the 14th of December. That's not yet the case in England under pressure to get the vaccine to care homes the NHS is working with transport companies to try to resolve it. Residents had been told they'd get it first. They are the most important and we still hold by that give but we do understand that there are logistical difficulties and as soon as there's unsamountable those care home residents will be fronted to the queue. Until the NHS can transport it safely hospitals have been told to vaccinate their inpatient sewer over 80 and care home staff but only those who can return three weeks later for a second dose. If we can't use all of those vaccinations for those groups then clearly we would want to use them for NHS staff but I think the expectation is that the vast majority of NHS staff will probably be done and early in the new year as opposed to before December but it depends upon when the vaccine doses arrive. The challenge to get this vaccine has been enormous. The next is the logistical one getting it into millions of us. We are the first country in the world to try it. The rest of the world's eyes then are on us."
BC court rules health officer justified in extending COVID vaccine mandate for health-care workers,Global News,2024-05-15,uBRbqwN02_s,"Andrea Henders hasn't worked in a hospital since 2021. When the province insisted health care workers be vaccinated against COVID, she declined and was fired. There just wasn't enough good evidence supporting its safety and efficacy and I just felt you know like I needed to hold off until there was that evidence available to us. Three years later the nurses learning like thousands of other health care professionals that they may never get their jobs back. The BC Supreme Court ruling the provincial health officer was justified in mandating vaccines during the pandemic. We should have had a choice where there is risk there must be choice. There were three similar petitions the court heard to overturn the health orders. The health care workers say the orders were an unreasonable use of Dr. Bonnie Henry's authority and the mandate violated workers' rights. Justice Simon covelled dismissed the petitions the government not backing away from the mandate. We review the these things all the time but I believe people should be vaccinated. Justice covelled did strike down one aspect of the order. It can no longer apply to workers in administrative positions or who work remotely. According to court documents, 1800 workers were terminated for not adhering to the mandate. Conservative leader John Rustad says losing those people has made the health care crisis in BC worse. We need every single person we can to be able to help to deliver the services that people need in their communities. BC the only jurisdiction in North America that still mandates COVID vaccinations. Henders is tired of fighting the government and the BC nurses union who she says stood by while she was unfairly fired. Her family has just bought a house in Alberta. That decision was heavily influenced by my husband and I both having been terminated from our jobs here in BC. The government will review the policy and make the changes set out by the courts. But at this point the health order has no expiration date. Aaron MacArthur Global News."
Landmark COVID vaccine ruling could open floodgates for compensation claims  | 7 News Australia,7NEWS - Australia,2024-02-28,vLCUQYjv1rs,"The COVID-19 Jabb mandate, challenged in court in a battle bankrolled by a billionaire, now the premier is hitting back. I'll certainly know regrets. I for one, one, health workers who believe in science and believe in vaccines. Dozens of police and Queensland ambulance staff who refuse the vaccine say they feel vindicated following yesterday's landmark court victory. A wave of other legal battles related to doctors, nurses, corrective services staff and teachers are also in the pipeline. There's certainly going to be some reflections about what the impact of that decision is. After the court decided directions by outgoing police commissioner Katarina Karrel were unlawful under the Human Rights Act. Police have lost their jobs. They were swiftly suspended without pay. Some of them remained without pay for, you know, up to two years. Directions for QAS staff by then Queensland Health Boss Dr John Wakefield found to be ineffective. A number of them have been re-employed across parts of Queensland and I would welcome them to reapply. It would be very nice if the police who have been terminated were welcome to come back to the service. But a class action funded by Clive Palmer and a compensation fight could now be in the works, paving the way for another legal stash with the government. We'll seek legal advice now. To decide what's next, Marlene Wop, 7 News."
Some people never get COVID-19 — researchers may now know why,CBC News: The National,2024-06-27,RlXLJ4NWkv0,"Scientists have new leads on why some people never get COVID. There is a lot to learn from studies like this and it is quite exciting. In a world's first challenge trial done at the height of the pandemic, researchers in the UK infected dozens of healthy, unvaccinated adults with a low dose of the original coronavirus. Then closely tracked how long it took their immune system to kick in. Participants who were infected right away had a slow response. In those who became infected but quickly cleared the virus, it was faster. But those who never became infected had the fastest response. Researchers noted high levels of activity in a specific gene called HLA-DQA2. Scientists think it helps flag viral invaders to the immune system so quick it destroys them before they can replicate. This work is really special in the point in the middle. Immunologists say they're still not sure how or why that specific gene offers protection. If you would ask me to bet money on what the genes that were going to be involved with the protection, these are not the ones I would have chosen. I feel lucky. We met Hugh Potter in 2022. He was exposed to COVID through his wife but never got sick. His DNA is part of ongoing research. Potter now wonders if that gene's protecting him. They do have a gene which could meet in the future, possible cures for people from maybe more than just the virus. Doctors who've been collecting DNA samples from people like Potter say while the UK study is helpful, there are more genetic secrets to unravel. It puts an anchor in the ground and says we got to look at this and everything around it. So that's how this major discoveries are made. All of the scientists we spoke with said while there are new variants and much more research is needed, this gene could help invent new vaccines to target COVID and possibly other respiratory viruses too.

Fact check: RFK Jr. says COVID vaccine mandates were ruled unconstitutional,WRAL,2024-07-02,b8RfOAPXqFU,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been critical of mandates for COVID vaccines. And he recently celebrated a court decision that he says ruled the mandates unconstitutional. Paul Spay checks that claim now for political facts. Did a federal court rule vaccine mandates are unconstitutional? Well, that's a Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted on Facebook the other day, and he was citing the ninth circuit court of appeals. Now, is he right about this? No, he's referring to a case brought by a group called the Health Freedom Defense Fund against leaders of the Los Angeles School District. That court of appeals did make a ruling in this case, which had previously been dismissed by Lower Court. The appeals court ruled that the Lower Court was wrong to dismiss the case because of a procedural issue. You can see they said the Lower Court wrongly applied a separate case in its dismissal. They also said their decision to revive this case is not a reflection of their views on vaccine mandates. You can see they wrote that they do not judge whether the plaintiffs are ultimately going to win their case. In other words, the ruling was about a procedural issue, not whether vaccine mandates are constitutional. And that's why the Truth of the Meter Rates Kennedy's claim falls.

New Details U.S. Distribution Plan For A Covid Vaccine | NBC Nightly News,NBC News,2020-09-16,9pOsJnjxjbw,"The Mass Vaccination Program will begin 24 hours after FDA approval of a vaccine. And Operation Warp Speed expects there will be more than one. The CDC and Department of Defense will work together to dispense the vaccines. They will be free and distributed in three phases, with the first vaccines going to priority populations like health workers and those at greatest risk for severe illness. It can be a very important tool to help us fight the COVID pandemic, but only if we use it right. Complicating the issues, some vaccines are expected to be given in two doses, three to four weeks apart, and must come from the same manufacturer. But today news that it will be a while. If we had a vaccine, say, released today, that it's going to take us probably in the order of nine months, six to nine months to get the American public vaccinated. In other words, next summer, how difficult will it be to vaccinate the entire country? There are an enormous number of hurdles to vaccination. One of them is fundamentally trust. And in recent weeks, we've seen an undermining of trust in the FDA and the CDC. And that's going to make it harder to protect us. Polls show Americans are worried about politics rushing vaccine development. 52 percent of adults don't trust President Trump's comments about vaccines. Today at a Senate hearing, the nation's top health officials insisted science is not being politicized. Even though the CDC has told governors to prepare to distribute vaccines, two days before the presidential election. There are no emails, no meetings, no phone calls, no backroom chats, connected with your choosing that particular date. Absolutely not. Meanwhile, progress for potential treatment. Eli Lilly saying it's drug derived from the antibody of one of the first American COVID patients dramatically decreased hospitalization risk in patients with mild to moderate cases. The results have not been independently reviewed. And as US COVID deaths near the 200,000 mark, advised from the CDC. This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine. Another reminder that today's best defense is one of the simplest. Antonson NBC News, New York.

Top doctor says she suffered COVID-19 vaccine injury | 9 News Australia,9 News Australia,2022-12-20,gRiDgasJDNs,"Well, a former top doctor is calling for more research into COVID-19 jobs after experiencing a vaccine injury. You're a former member for Wentworth, Dr Karen Phelps, suffered irregular blood pressure and breathlessness following her second jab. And please to say she joins us live. Dr Phelps, good morning. You end your wife, both suffered vaccine injuries. Can you take us through what happened? Yes, good morning, Charles, like Christine. Well, in Jackie's case, we obviously did a lot of homework about the vaccines. And went along to have the vaccines done, because we believe that on the ballots of risks and benefits that that was the best thing to do. And within minutes of having the vaccine, she had quite severe reaction with numbness of her hands and feet tingling all over her body, her head feeling like it was going to explode pain. And then over the weeks and months following that, the condition continued. She'd seen a number of specialists and the conclusion was that she had had an injury related to the vaccine. And so that was in her case. I went back and had the second vaccine, thinking that it's a rare reaction. And again, on the ballots of risks and benefits, and in my case, I developed a reaction where my blood pressure, my pulse rate and my temperature was going up and down or over the place, and with some quite distressing symptoms and persisting for quite some time. And over a period of many months. And I was diagnosed with a vaccine-related dysautonomia. So over the process of the last year and a half or so, I've also spoken to a number of colleagues who've had vaccine adverse events themselves, patients who've had vaccine adverse events. And so when I was putting in the submission to the long COVID and reinfection inquiry for the Australian Parliament just in the last month or so, I included the group of people who have suffered adverse events from vaccination as a group that needs to have special consideration when it comes to prevention of long COVID. These are serious side effects. Why did the medical regulator, Arpra, warn doctors then, as you claim, not to speak out about these vaccine side effects? We'd have to ask Arpra themselves about their motivation, but certainly quite a number of doctors that I've spoken to have felt impeded in speaking out about their concerns about vaccine adverse events because of the statement made by Arpra that doctors shouldn't say anything that was going to impede the government's vaccine rollout. And they took that to mean not to publicly raise their concerns. Now I think it's important to say that when we're talking about a massive pandemic with a high rate of deaths and hospitalisation that there has to always be, with any immunisation programme, a balance of risks and benefits of what we are trying to achieve in terms of reducing deaths and hospitalisations, balanced against the fact that with any medication, any vaccine, there are going to be some people who have adverse events. But I think it's very important with this new vaccine. It's only been around for less than two years that it's time that we put some research funding and some real effort into looking at the causes for the vaccine adverse events that people are experiencing. And they're experiencing a whole range of different types of vaccine events. They're experiencing things like cardiovascular events with myocarditis, pericarditis, and that's not just confined to young males. I've spoken to middle aged female doctors who've had this effect. People who have rheumatological side effects, or they have musculoskeletal and joint pain, I've spoken to people who've had cardiological side effects. It's a whole range of different groups of people who've had neurological side effects, for example. So we're looking at immune system problems with people with reactivation of autoimmune disease. So with this large spectrum of side effects, we're also seeing a very large side effects, range of side effects of people with long COVID. And so there are some crossovers in people with the adverse effects from the vaccine and long COVID, quite similar symptoms in many, so there could be some common factors there, which needs research, needs funding and needs a big effort. Dr. Feltz, we appreciate your time this morning. Thank you."

Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer’s vaccine trial,The BMJ,2022-03-16,RaLxhFiOBYk,"I'm going to go to the next slide. My name is Brooke Jackson. I was fired in September of 2020 for being a visible. I was working on Pfizer's Phase 3 portal trial on their website. My first day on the job was the 8th of September. And from the very beginning, I noticed irregularities, things that were questionable. I would bring up the concerns to my managers and staff were really trying hard to make this work. You know, at one point when I was going through emails, there were emails from icon begging Ventavia to follow up on severe adverse events that had been reported. There were several emails about the patient's symptoms. There were specimens that were labeled with another participants information. It was a nightmare. On the 16th of September, I stayed late in clinic one evening. I walked into an area where the patient was reaffirmed or frozen. When I walked in, I saw a bio hazard bag. The plastic bio hazard bag contained used needles. I realized how unorganized and sloppy Ventavia was handling everything. I was just left out and the box is that the vaccine came in, the containers. They had written the subject information on these containers. So right there, you know, me working on the study, it unblinded me to the randomization of these patients. I made note of that. I took pictures. I was really happy to see what I had seen to show my managers. It was also discovered that Ventavia was unblinding participants in the study based on a directive from RCO, which was to print out the randomization scheme and put that drug assignment in everybody's chart. Per Pfizer's protocol, we should have a look at the data. We were able to see the data from the data. Instead, they wanted us to go through each of the charts and actually take out the randomization scheme that was printed. So that coupled with everything else, I made the recommendation for Ventavia to stop the data. You sent me the photos, thank you, and I didn't pull them up. I mean, no, granted. I hope they're on the show. Should I not have taken the pictures? The problem is the breach of confidentiality, and it was a personal thing because there's a sponsor information on this boxes. At that point, it was clear to me that I wasn't fitting in. I decided that next morning, I was going to report my company to the FDA. And so I did that about nine o'clock in the morning on the 25th of September. And about six hours later, I got a call from Ventavia and was fired on the spot and told that I was not a good fit. I remember investigator Cannon called me, and we spoke for an hour and 16 minutes. To be precise, I can tell you everything that we talked about. It mirrored what was typed in my formal complaint to them, the unblinding, the safety of the clinical trial participants, not monitoring them for adverse reactions. They were late to report adverse events. Again, the untrained staff, the oversight by the principal investigators, specifically at the Fort Worth location, the targeting of the employees for coming forward. I thought that the FDA was going to swoop in and take care of everything. What I was reporting was so important. I was looking for a way to get the information from the department. I was looking for a way to get the information from the department. I was looking for a way to get the information from the department. I was looking for a way to get the information from the department. I was looking for a way to get the information from the department. I was looking for a way to get the information from the department. I was looking for a way to get the"
Study reveals AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines linked to rare neurological side effects,Arirang News,2021-10-26,KJvsp3Ayzss,"And staying with COVID-19, both the AstraZeneca and the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines have been linked to rare, but potentially serious neurological complications. Following research from the University of Oxford on more than 32 million people in England, analysts found 38 cases of Gilean Bar syndrome per 10 million people given the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has resulted in numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness. There were around 60 cases of hemorrhoric stroke per 10 million given the Pfizer vaccine. However, experts pointed out that not getting vaccinated is still more dangerous."
The Nobel laureates behind mRNA COVID vaccines,CBS Sunday Morning,2024-03-03,fdGj6p2qDdk,"It's easy to think of great historical moments in the abstract, but too often the people behind them are largely forgotten. This morning, California spends time with two unsung heroes, who is groundbreaking work, we can all be thankful for. Katie, we'll tell you I'm a quiet guy who sticks to myself. I didn't know about him either. Why didn't you check around? At the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, Drew Weissman and Cataline Carrico, known as Katie, met by chance at a copy machine in 1998. We both used to copy a lot of articles to read. We started talking. He was an immunologist, studying cells that adapt to mountain-immune responses against diseases. She was a biochemist, working with messenger RNA, known as mRNA. The molecule that teaches cells how to make proteins. I joke it's like the Reese's commercial where the chocolate and the peanut butter come together and make a new treat. We learn from each other. What is it, do you think, that makes a good scientific team? Respect each other, listen to each other. We didn't try to overpower each other, you know, just... Did you try? No, never. Their collaboration led to the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines in 2020. That year, the virus spread worldwide, leading to global lockdowns and killing millions. I knew the minute I heard about it, it's a virus, it's a respiratory infection. I knew the vaccine was going to work. How did the lockdown affect your life and your work? We never stopped working. They worked, they had nine different shifts and minimizing the presence of people in one room. This is the frozen vaccine. Wow. For patients, you thought this out, you dilute it and you inject it in their arms. The mRNA COVID vaccine uses mRNA to direct the cells to create a spike protein, like the one on the surface of the virus, so the body builds defenses against that protein. This protection helps fight the virus. The vaccine became available in the United States in December 2020. That month, Weisman and Carico were vaccinated with a flourish. Did you think on that day about all the years and decades of work it took to get to that point? Yes, yes, I was thinking about that and thinking about what we went through. They put up some cameras and took pictures and had fun. Pfizer, Moderna, which one? Pfizer. The COVID vaccine reduced the death toll and helped people get back to relatively normal lives. Was there any disappointment that the vaccine didn't just sort of put an end to COVID once and for all? In the beginning of the pandemic, I would go into the intensive care units and every bed would have a COVID patient on a ventilator doing poorly. And now when I went into the intensive care units, there were no COVID patients at all. And that's because of the vaccine. And their work will be used in the battle against some of the world's most difficult diseases. How bright is the future? It's truly phenomenal. Right now there's 250 phase one clinical trials of RNA vaccines. People are making vaccines for HIV, for malaria, for hepatitis C, for TB, for food allergies. Talk to a parent with a kid with a peanut allergy and every day as a panic. The COVID vaccines were backed by government mandates and sparked an uproar. The controversy, I still don't understand people thinking that science and vaccines are out to get them. And I've never heard of such a thing before. Well, maybe it's just what happens when politics collides with medicine. That's not the job of our politicians. We're not supposed to tell people how to live less well of how to die from diseases. They're supposed to help the world. This past December, three years after the vaccine was released, the Nobel Prize Committee awarded Carrico and Weisman its 18-karat gold medallion. How long does it take for it to sink in? It's still happening. Yeah, it takes time. Did you think? Finally. My finally moment was the Phase III clinical trials when we saw that the vaccines were 95 percent effective. That was a life's work has turned into something useful. Did you take a moment to celebrate? No, I'm not much of a celebrator. I just probably went back to work. Famously, I ate the whole bag of chocolate covered peanut. Well, on a day like that, you had definitely earned it. A good scientific lab has top of the line equipment, but a really great scientific lab has a trophy run. When you think about becoming a scientist, is it somewhere in the back of your head like, I might win the Nobel Prize? Never. No. My parents, when I was maybe five, they were brought in on a tour of the Nobel auditorium. And at one point, they walked up to a pair of seats and said, reserve these for us. If Wiesman's rise seemed predictable, Caracos did not. Born and communist Hungary, Caracos never knew a scientist, but she knew she wanted to be one. In 1985, 30-year-old Katie Caracos, along with her husband and young daughter, left Hungary for a job in a lab in Pennsylvania. This teddy bear seems like it would be kind of out of place. But this is actually a very important bear, isn't it? Yes, this is the bear that helped us yet to America and start our life. If I turn this over, someone did a little surgery on this teddy bear, didn't they tell me what happened here? I put $1,000 equivalent of British pounds and I saw it back because in Hungary, we were not allowed to take any money out of the country. The daughter was the mule. Nobody found it, nobody suspected. And from there, to here, Nobel Prize. And some decades in between. Decades spent doing what both Catalina Caracos and Drew Weisman truly love. Loverador is a wonderful place and so kind of my home is a laboratory. I sometimes get the sense that maybe you would rather be in the lab doing your work than talking to journalists. Yeah, partially it is true, but also we realize that it is important to go out and educate the public and explain what we are doing and inspire the next generation of scientists. Exactly. I'm much happier and nothing personal. I'm still happier sitting in my office or in my lab working. That's my favorite place. As a member of the human race, I'm glad to have you working in your lab."
"COVID cases rise as summer hits, new vaccine may be coming",11Alive,2024-06-28,TH49NVrE3Ds,"Well, at summertime and a summer COVID-19 surge is here. According to the CDC cases have been rising in at least 38 states, particularly in the West and South for weeks. So hospitalizations and deaths, they are also ticking up over the past few months. The variant that drove the winter surge has been overtaken by newer offshoot. CDC says two of these new variants now account for more than half of these infections in the U.S. Meanwhile, a new COVID-19 vaccine could be coming this fall based on these latest strains the CDC recommending anyone six months of age and older should receive one of the new COVID-19 vaccines when they become available. Update vaccines give targeted protection from a virus in immunity from a previous shot or infection decreases over time. So the CDC says people who got the last COVID-19 vaccine had increased protection against hospital visits compared with people who did not get the shot."
Bret Weinstein tells Tucker: 17 million dead from COVID vaccine,David Pakman Show,2024-01-08,P3nXJB5PoBM,"Let's do a couple of COVID related stories. Brett Weinstein, evolutionary biologist and podcast host of the dark horse podcast was recently interviewed by former Fox News propagandist Tucker Carlson and Brett told Tucker something that sounds shocking because it is and it's wrong. Which is that 17 million people have died from the COVID vaccine. That is quite a claim. Let's take a listen to what Brett had to say, gauge Tucker's reaction, and more generally we will discuss it. There was a press, I was recently at a conference in Romania on the COVID crisis. And so there was a lot of work trying to unpack what we actually understand. And I saw a credible estimate or something like 17 million deaths that globally from this technology. So 17 million deaths from the COVID vaccine. Well, when you scale up to billions, it's not hard to reach a number like that with the technology that's dangerous. Now to your deeper question, I think let's. And by the way, these are not our subtitles. They're a mess, but I just want to make clear these are not our subtitles. Steel man. Just for perspective, I mean that's like the death toll of a global war. Yes. Absolutely. This is a great tragedy of history. So that proportion. And amazingly, there is no way in which it's over. I mean, we are still apparently recommending these things for healthy children ever stood any chance of getting any benefit from. Every chance of suffering harms that are not only serious, but tragic on the basis that children have long lives ahead of you. So listen, let's start anecdotally. Okay, the claim is 17 million people have been killed by the COVID vaccine and it's continuing. Let's start anecdotally, which is not the way we do things, but sometimes it's useful to start with an anecdote just as a sniff test and then we'll go further. Okay. First of all, does anybody in my audience know a single person who had a serious vaccine complication? Maybe there's a couple of you. Okay. Sometimes that happens extremely rare. We have an audience in the millions. Certainly it's possible that someone in the audience, not not you, but knows someone who had a serious vaccine complication. Maybe there's a few of you. Okay. Does anyone in my audience know of anybody personally, right? Who died from the COVID vaccine? I assume the answer is zero since almost no one. Okay. Almost no one has died from vaccine complications. So does anyone in my audience then know anybody who has died from COVID or COVID complications just about everybody I know says the answer is yes. I assume the answer is yes, both personally and certainly obviously we know of people through the media. My aunt died of complications from COVID. She was immunocompromised, had a number of health issues, got COVID never recovered, passed away. An uncle of mine died from COVID pneumonia. Now let's go beyond anecdote. Okay. The global death toll of COVID, about six million closer to seven depending on whether we talk recorded deaths or an excess death model. Okay. Somewhere between six and seven million dead of COVID and 17 million dead of the vaccine. Now you can go and watch the presentation that Brett saw in Romania. Okay. It's a Canadian scientist, Dennis Rancourt. Here's just like a few seconds of it. This is all available online. It's 26 minutes seen that is explained by the magic of mathematical models written by bought out scientists working for bought out politicians. So it is not true. The vaccine did not save lives. Okay. You can go and watch this entire thing. And then you will have the information that that Brett has. And then you can also find the 130 page so-called analysis of this on which that presentation is based. We're not going to link to it. We're putting up a screenshot, but we're not going to link to it since I don't know. We could be banned or something who knows. And here's what this quote analysis did. The analysis looked at all cause mortality in 17 countries. And the analysis claims that all cause mortality data shows there was no benefit from a COVID vaccine. Now all it does is it looks at population data doesn't confirm whether anybody who died was even vaccinated. And it makes it an impossibility to draw any kind of conclusion about the relationship between vaccination and mortality. Like at the top level, it's bogus. We don't even need to go further, but we can. The analysis also ignores really good evidence that we have that when we see a spike in excess mortality in a country, it aligned with a COVID surge, not a vaccination surge. If you look and you say, okay, we know there was a COVID surge in this country at this time. And then you see excess mortality go up. That's really good data about what might be going on. On the other hand, if you look at a country like Peru, when you saw the excess deaths spike, did not coincide with when the vaccination rates went up. We know when the vaccination rates went way up in Peru and you didn't see excess deaths. So the studies that we have show all cause mortality is higher in the states with lower vaccination rates and all cause mortality was lower in states with higher vaccination rates. So it is truly dangerous. Listen, do I think Brett Weinstein really believes this? I genuinely do not know. I do not know whether Brett Weinstein believes this stuff five years ago, four or five years ago, I would have said Brett Weinstein is too smart to fall for this crap. It's just what my view would have been. And I don't know what the answer is because unfortunately, if he doesn't believe it, then he's deliberately spreading misinformation, which I mean, what's worse, being a liar, being misinformed, being a deliberate liar seems worse to me. It's really sad what's happened to Brett Weinstein and of course, opportunist Tucker Carlson loves the ability to just promote the hell out of this crap for clicks and is even getting clicks. I don't know. Something that's been in the news a lot lately is data brokers collecting vast amounts of data about everything you do on your phone and computer, where you go, what you look at, they identify patterns in your behavior. And it's really quite disturbing how much data brokers know about us, even our health information. And then we found out that sometimes government agencies like the FBI will buy that information from data brokers to spy on Americans without warrants, add companies buy the data to serve you ads, financial institutions can use the information. The information can even end up on public search sites where anybody can see it, but there is a way to stop it. Our sponsor in Cogni is an affordable service that sends automatic data removal requests to data brokers who are required by law to comply. In Cogni even follows up with the data brokers to ensure your data is permanently gone and in Cogni keeps you updated every step of the way. I use in Cogni myself.

Covid Vaccine for Kids is Safe and Effective,Healthcare Triage,2022-07-23,0E-InXxJYfc,"COVID vaccines have finally been recommended for children under five. There are bound to be many questions about this, so we've put together an episode on the data. That's the topic of this week's healthcare triage. Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were recommended for approval in June of 22 for kids between six months and four years of age. Vaccination is recommended even for kids who have had COVID, mainly because the combination of previous infection and vaccination seems to offer the greatest protection. Side note, if they've just had COVID, evidence suggests that you consider waiting up to three months to vaccinate them. Longer than three months is an advisable, but that waiting period may contribute to more efficacy for the vaccine. Not other research. In pediatric trials, antibody responses were similar to those seen in adult trials. In the Moderna trial, there were 4792 kids in the vaccine group and 1,596 in the placebo group. Protection against symptomatic illness landed at 36.8 percent in the two to five age group and at 50.6 percent in the six to 23 month group. So, similar to adults, vaccination appears to protect mainly against serious illness and death, meaning a vaccinated kid isn't totally protected from symptomatic COVID infection. However, if they do get sick, vaccination gives them a far better chance of recovery without any serious incidents. As for serious adverse events, meaning not expected things like fevers and reactions at the injection site, which did occur to reasonably high rate, the Moderna data report won for each of those age groups. In the two to five year age group, there was one incident of vomiting, fatigue, and fever, all of which cleared within two hours. In the younger age group, one instance of a febrile seizure and a rash occurred. Okay, now for the Pfizer data. There were 992 total kids vaccinated and 464 in the placebo group. So, lower overall than the Moderna trial. Antibody numbers look good here too. Even better than in the Moderna trial. With the antibody response looking better than adults, but we have less information about protection against symptomatic illness because the sample size was too small. Safety looks good here as well, with just two potentially vaccine-related serious reactions, both of which resolved. There seem to be fewer minor side effects like fevers and injection site reactions for this vaccine. Many parents have been anxiously awaiting the peace of mind that would come with the opportunity to vaccinate their younger children. For other parents though, there's some anxiety and a few questions. One of the most common points brought up by hesitant parents is that kids are at low risk for serious illness anyway, so why vaccinate? This is true, but the data on the safety of these vaccines are pretty stellar for all age groups. So when comparing the two risks, you're looking at a higher risk of serious illness from infection, then you are any kind of serious side effects from the vaccine. So as we've said before in episodes on vaccination, we recommend taking the path of least risk. In this case, that's clearly vaccination. And don't forget, your child spends time around other people who are at higher risk, so vaccinating them does contribute to the safety of others, many of whom they love. For those who are ready to vaccinate their children, they may be wondering which vaccine to get. Both are effective, but there are differences that may matter to parents depending on their individual preferences. One of the biggest differences is dose, with Pfizer delivering a smaller dose than Moderna. Because of this, Moderna provides protection a bit more quickly, but Pfizer is a little bit less likely to cause those minor side effects like fever. The Moderna vaccine requires only two doses, with the second dose given at least four weeks after the first dose. The Pfizer vaccine requires three doses, with the second dose being given at three to eight weeks after the first, and the third dose given at least 56 days after the second. So where can you get your child vaccinated? More places are making the pediatric vaccine available every day, but if you need some help or just want the easiest option, call 211, because in most states there's a line set up and they'll help you get scheduled.

COVID-19 Vaccine: What you have to do to get a religious exemption and how you can be denied.,ABC10,2021-09-29,ButW2kNe564,"As more and more employers require employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, many workers are pushing back citing religious beliefs against getting it. But what does the law say and how does an employer decide? ABC 10's Kurt Rivera explains in tonight's cover story. At Destiny Christian Church in Rockland and it's on the form, all the scripture references. A pastor signs exemption forms citing religious beliefs as protection from the need for a COVID-19 vaccine. For us who choose not to, we put our faith in the Lord. But how does that hold up in the workplace? According to the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, employers must provide quote, reasonable accommodations for workers who have quote, sincerely held religious beliefs. It doesn't mean that they have to grant all exemption requests. Michelle Mello is a Stanford Law School and Health Policy Professor for the University School of Medicine. He says in the past, employers have granted a quote, fairly large birth for religious exemptions. But with COVID, that has changed. In this context, there are some distinct challenges because many of the people who are filing religious exemption requests have never refused vaccines before. This is the only vaccine that they object to. And the nature of their objection isn't truly religious. It's more of a personal belief exemption that they're trying to shoehorn into their religious exemption channel. And she says under the law, employers are allowed to question the employee about their exemption. It doesn't require that you've tithed to a recognized denomination or that you have a letter from your clergy person. It does require that you articulate an argument that is religious in nature and not more generally just about your personal beliefs. And then there's a portion that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says gives the employer the right to deny a religious exemption on what's called undue hardship. Justifying this quote more than a diminimus or minimal burden or cost to run an employer's business. It could lead to an employee getting fired. For certain industries, there isn't a reasonable accommodation in the employee is going to be faced with a hard choice. And healthcare is certainly one of those industries. Education is probably another where remote work is not really feasible. And some of the other accommodations that the employer might think about just aren't going to do the trick in terms of reassuring everyone that they can operate a safe workplace. San Joaquin County Public Health Officer, Dr. Maggie Parks says quote, the California Department of Public Health guidelines stress religious exemption should be based on sincerely held religious beliefs. San Joaquin County Public Health Services continues to reach out to our faith-based organizations to help answer questions about the COVID-19 vaccine and making the shots readily available to the community. And the Federal Labor Code also allows an employer to grant a different religious accommodation than what the employee is asking for if it poses undue hardship to the business."
New York City workers protest COVID vaccine mandate,CBS Evening News,2021-10-28,BilSXcYHnUE,"Tonight, New York City is br possible shortage of police as a COVID vaccination 100s of first responders took their complaints about the mayor's mansion today. We have more now from CBS Moa Lenguy. This is about anti mandate anti mandate only. The divide over New York City's vaccine mandate for city workers spilled into the streets of Manhattan today. Firefighters EMTs anditel. Left identification with faded workers, charged with candidation workers largely unmasked rallied outside the mayor's official residence. Just one day before the deadline for municipal employees to get at least one covid shot, or be placed on Unpaid fleet. On those all butой 38,000 City workers are vaccinated but about a quarter of the police force and a third a firefighters are not decay. Grace a vaccine on somebody's should be a choice. Six of the planning vaccine mandates for municipal workers. Of those New York, Los Angeles and San Diego do not have a testing alternative. New York City's largest police union sued this week to block the mayor's vaccine mandate, but a state judge rejected that request. The police are asking the city to adopt a weekly testing option in lieu of vaccination. Even though compared to health care workers, first responders are at higher risk of contracting COVID. We're going to show up to work and fulfill our oath. If the mayor of the commission sends them home, what happens is on them. But you're going to be ready to work that day. Absolutely. But today, the mayor doubled down. You want to protest, go protest. People want these jobs. Anyone that doesn't want to do the job anymore. I know someone else will step up and fill it. Now, if unvaccinated first responders are sent home Monday, according to the firefighters union, up to 20 percent of firehouses could have to close. That, of course, would impact the city's ambulance fleet and in turn, response times. But the mayor says he has a contingency plan in place, Nora. All right. We'll be watching that closely. Mollolinghi. Thank you."
Can the Covid vaccine harm unborn babies during pregnancy? - BBC News,BBC News,2022-01-17,GtYNX69Abv0,"Over half of the world's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine against coronavirus, but there are big differences in vaccination rates across the globe. Less than 10 percent of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated. Vaccine supply is still a big problem in many countries, but even when vaccines are available, many are concerned about taking them. We've looked into some of the most common concerns. You're in our skeptical, our hesitant, about taking a decobid-nating vaccine is because of this speed at which the vaccine we have produced. Vaccines against COVID have been produced at record speed, not because they've skipped steps or rushed the research, but because so many scientists and companies from all over the world have shared the work. COVID vaccines have been comprehensively tested for safety, first in trials of hundreds of thousands of people to pick up any common side effects, and then through careful monitoring as the vaccines were given to millions of people in the general population, allowing scientists to spot much rarer reactions. But even now, they are still being studied and monitored. But what about the idea that people who've been vaccinated without any problems might suddenly develop issues months or years down the line. Scientists who study vaccines and the immune system say this is extremely unlikely. We know enough about how the human body works, and we have enough experience from previous vaccines to know that any side effects will emerge within the first two months or so. So we've had more than enough time for any possible side effects to show up. No vaccine can give you 100 percent protection from guessing ill, but crucially, if you do develop symptoms, they are likely to be much milder. The vaccine still give high protection against becoming very ill and ending up in hospital, even with newer variants. Although you can still catch the virus, you are less likely to, and if you do catch COVID after being vaccinated, you're also less likely to pass it on, protecting the people around you. During pregnancy, it's totally understandable that people want to be extra cautious, but the data so far is reassuring. Millions have been vaccinated, and we haven't seen any worrying side effects related to pregnancy or fertility yet. Large studies have found vaccinated pregnant women are no more likely to experience complications, including miscarriage than unvaccinated women. There are, however, increased risks to people during pregnancy if they catch COVID. Those who get the virus, particularly in later pregnancy, are more likely to become severely ill, will have a premature or stillbirth. Some people are worried that getting vaccinated may affect their future fertility, but there's no evidence or scientific basis for believing this to be the case. We know that there are very rare, serious side effects to the COVID vaccines. The risks of long-term health problems and death are much more common from catching COVID than from the vaccine, even in younger people. That's important to be aware of, so you can balance those risks and benefits when making your decision whether to get vaccinated."
Elton John and Michael Caine star in NHS Covid vaccine ad,Guardian News,2021-02-09,CjzZOM6kGZg,"Elton John, audition take one. My name is Elton John. Cut there, little less showbiz Elton. My name is Elton John. Bit more showbiz. My name is Elton John. Let's go for your Michael Cain impression. Just let's see what it's like. More name is Elton John. Beautiful cut there. The more people in society that get vaccinated, the more chance there is or we're eradicating the national COVID pandemic. It's really important to know that the vaccines have all been through and met the necessary safety and quality standards. So this is a bit we're going to have the vaccine now, Elton. So just kind of pretend that you're having the vaccine from a nurse. Oh, what was that, Elton? That was me acting. OK, let's cut there. And as you can see, I'm still standing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow, OK, thanks Elton. We'll let you know. Oh, well, at this short notice, you won't find anyone bigger. Thank you. Hello, my name is Michael Cain. I've just had a vaccine for COVID. It didn't hurt. Not many people know that. And cut there. And Marbus, that was fantastic. Thank you. I'll clear that little fella now he didn't get the job."
Does the COVID Vaccine Change Your DNA?,Doc Schmidt,2021-06-13,1uT_yBQhiCw,"So does the COVID vaccine change your DNA? The short answer is no. I'm a doctor and I can explain why. So your body is made up of cells. This whole thing is a cell. And inside most of the cells, there's a nucleus. And the nucleus is what holds all of your DNA. Now bear with me here. Your body makes all of its important proteins from this DNA, but first it has to transcribe it, make it into messenger RNA. See that? So DNA gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which is kind of like a blueprint for a protein. The messenger RNA moves out of the nucleus and then just kind of hangs out in the cell, looking for a ribosome. See that? The ribosome is what actually turns the mRNA blueprint into a protein that can do something for the cell. Proteins are the basis of all of human life. So this mRNA gets turned into a protein by the ribosome. So that's basic biology. So what does the COVID vaccine do? When you get the COVID vaccine, there's messenger RNA already in that vaccine and gets injected into your bloodstream and it finds its way into cells. The COVID messenger RNA, or mRNA, is specifically a blueprint for a protein called the spike protein. It's one of the main proteins of the COVID virus. So when this messenger RNA gets into the cell, it doesn't even go into the nucleus where the DNA is. It wants to be where the ribosomes are, so that it can make the spike protein. That's its only job. Find a ribosome, get made into the spike protein. So it goes over the ribosome and we get the spike protein. Then the spike protein gets put up here. See this? The spike protein ends up at the top of the cell like that. The body recognizes that this spike protein isn't something that's normally on a cell in the human body, because it's a COVID protein, right? So then the body makes antibodies saying, hey, watch out for this. We should attack this if we ever see it because this isn't normal. So then you make lots of antibodies. You go about your day. That process of making antibodies is why you feel a little sick sometimes after you get the COVID vaccine. So then let's say a month later, you get infected with COVID. Those COVID particles are going to have the spike protein all over them. Your body as antibodies are going to say, hey, we've seen that before. Let's attack it. And then you don't get a serious COVID infection. This is a long-winded way to explain that your DNA is never going to change from the COVID vaccine, because all you're getting in the COVID vaccine is messenger RNA, and it never even goes near the DNA. Messenger RNA can't be turned back into DNA. It only goes one way. So it's not anything to worry about. Similarly, you can't get COVID from the COVID vaccine, because all that's in the vaccine is this little messenger RNA. All that it can make is this spike protein, and the virus is so much more than just that protein. So you can't get the virus from the vaccine either. It's great news, right? Share the video to someone who you think it might help."
British regulators limit covid vaccines,Dr. John Campbell,2023-01-25,sidjKoHS6NE,"I want to welcome just a brief evening update for Wednesday the 25th. I wanted to bring you this sort of hot off the press. It's from the joint committee on vaccination and immunization. And basically what the saying is as from the 12th of next month, healthy under 50s are not going to be eligible for COVID vaccination in the UK. Some might say this is a sensible targeting of resources as we move towards endemicity. Others might suggest it's a frantic backpedaling. The report is written in very positive language about this move to a more rational distribution of resources. Nothing about side effects, nothing about adverse reactions, nothing about changing risk benefit analysis. Some of you might find one about to say fairly pathetic, but let's do it anyway. JVCI makes recommend interim recommendations and we can expect these to be taken up by the government of course has advised that plans should be made for those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 to be offered a boost of vaccination. So looking ahead. So it's not saying that young people are at minimal risk, especially in the age of Omicron. It's not saying that we've now got huge amounts of natural immunity. It's not saying we've now got huge amounts of mucus of immunity. No, it's just a simple rationalization and targeting of resources. Professor Lim Chair, as the transition continues away from a pandemic emergency response towards pandemic recovery. In England, the closure of the autumn booster campaign will be on the 12th of February 2023. Still over two weeks away I guess, two and a half weeks away. Basically it means no more boosters fell for healthy under 50s, which we are of course very pleased to see. Similarly, the JVCI is advising that the primary course of COVID vaccination should move over the course of 2023 towards a more targeted offer. So this is going to include primary immunization as well as the boosters fairly soon. And this is all here. Read it for yourself. It's just put in language which makes everything sound so positive. There's no mention of anything negative. It really does strike me as being. It's not written in a genuine way as far as I can see, but but there we go. Now the current recommendations in the UK. Oh, there's also another document here. That is linked to COVID vaccination program. This is actually the official document. Oh, blog plotting myocarditis and pericarditis in Giong Barra syndrome. I guess it's not any longer possible to ignore these adverse reactions. What's the word that describes it? There's a word they use rare. That's it. These rare reactions. So it's good to see some honesty at least on on that site there. Now at the moment in the UK and let me just read it. Coronavirus COVID vaccinations in the UK. Everyone aged five on all before the 31st of all was 2022. I know we can get a first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. But at the moment in my country, you can take a perfectly healthy child into see a professional health care advisor, health care practitioner. And they will inject a healthy five year old child with a messenger, ribonucleic acid vaccine. That is the current position in my country at the moment. I want to disagree with this. I merely reported. There you go. That's the advice there from my government. So that now then Denmark, of course, is ahead of the curb somewhat as usual. Here's the Danish government site. They were ready actually adopted this position very kind of the Danish authorities, of course, to make full copies available of their documentation in English. So he's me using Google translate. We recommend vaccination of people age 50 years and over as well as selected risk groups. So ahead of the game. Other countries have got to move to this pretty soon. I mean, the simply, they simply have to the risk of severe disease in young people from on the phone who have been previously exposed to the virus. And we all have been previously exposed now. It's absolutely minimal risk benefit analysis has changed as I've been saying for. Well, now what we have for over a year now, radical change. Now just to finish off on a completely separate matter. And this is nothing to do with the history of the mRNA vaccines, of course. Regulator refunding this article in the British medical journal. Now the British medical journal says industry money saturates the global leading regulators. Not my words British medical journal. That's what they say saturates. And here we have a table. Now, I'm aware you weren't able to see this. I'm going to read some of the some of the salient points about industry money. Proportion of the budget derived from industry. So this is it here. So Australia, it's 96 percent. You're a pit 89 percent. United Kingdom. It's only 86 percent. So that means in the United Kingdom, 86 percent of the regulators money comes from industry. And I don't imagine it's shoe making industry to you. In the United States, it's actually quite a bit lower. It's only 65 percent. Now, of course, no one's saying that the fact that Australia get 96 percent of the money that the Europe get 89 percent of the money that UK get a 6 percent of the money. The Japan gets 85 percent of the money that the US regulators get 65 percent and Canada only 50.5 percent. No one's saying any of these huge percentages have any influence on their decision making, of course. We merely report what is in the British medical journal, various other things. The BMJS kept this in the public domain. So check it out for yourself. There you go. If there was anyone here that wants to rush out and get a vaccine, who's healthy below the age of 50 before the expiry time in the UK, you've got to the 12th of January. I won't be rushing. My last vaccine was on the, it was in November 2021. I haven't had one since then. Can't tell you what to do, of course. But I haven't had one since 2020. So there we go. Change from the JVCI all in very positive language as they move towards consolidation and targeting. I'll leave you to make what you like of that. But thank you for watching."
Covid Vaccine Side Effects + VAERS,Doc Schmidt,2022-01-02,mkZ1MabMEZw,"So what do you think about getting the COVID vaccine today? I don't know, Doc, what about the side effects? If you look in VAERS, there's millions of side effects. True, but those aren't all verified. You think they're made up? No, I'm saying a lot of those side effects weren't actually from the vaccine. But it says they were. The VAERS data isn't automatically verified by professionals. It's reviewed by the experts to look for patterns. It says thousands of people died from the vaccine. That seems like a pattern to me. For instance, on VAERS right now, 12 people were reported in October of 2021 to have died within seven days of getting the COVID vaccine. I don't want to die. At month, 6.6 million Americans were vaccinated. Okay. And 55,000 Americans die every week. From COVID, I heard that's inflated. Because no, from anything, there are a lot of Americans. In 2019, on average, 55,000 Americans died every week. Wow. So if we've vaccinated every American in one day, we'd expect 55,000 of them to die within the next seven days. Seems high. 6.6 million vaccinations in October of 2021 is 1.8 percent of Americans. So even if we gave them a popsicle instead of a vaccine, we'd expect 991 of them to die within the next seven days. Did you say popsicles? So just because they died within seven days of getting the vaccine doesn't mean they died from the vaccine. You're saying popsicles kill people. No. Nice. So can I have one? A vaccine? A popsicle. End of vaccine? No, I'm good."
Myocarditis and coronavirus vaccines: Explaining the rare side effect,Washington Post,2021-12-15,I3kd5SyYHEE,"Over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, there has been growing evidence linking COVID-19 infections to myocarditis and patients. Myocarditis is simply inflammation of the heart muscle. It occurs in response to infection or to injury. That injury can be from what we call autoimmune diseases. When the body is reacting to a certain invader, it's producing antibodies to attack that invader and sometimes it gets a little confused and may actually attack the body itself. Our bodies respond to COVID-19 by producing antibodies to attack the virus. And in rare cases, when these antibodies attack the heart, the resulting inflammation can start impeding normal heart function, resulting in a slew of symptoms. If the damage becomes a little more extensive or in some ways disturbs the nerves, then people can feel it as chest pain. If it gets extensive enough that it disturbs the actual function of the heart, then it can cause short-sure breath because the heart's not functioning in the usual way. And there could be some heart failure, that is the, some of the lungs can become congested because the heart's not functioning properly. Most often with myocarditis, these things just heal themselves. And in many cases, people may not have even known they had it. It's only in some rare cases where the damage becomes extensive enough that it actually causes people problems. There has also been evidence of myocarditis in patients who have received the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines. And despite being an incredibly rare occurrence, about one case per 50,000 patients according to two Israeli studies, myocarditis has been cited by some of the vaccine hesitant as a reason they are holding off. What we've seen is that this risk, this increase in risk seems localized to males somewhere between 18 and 29. And the risk again in the very best studies is suggested to be quite low, that the people who are affected are most often affected in a very mild way. It's what we call self-limited. Federal officials have acknowledged a link between myocarditis and the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. But experts agree, the benefits of vaccines far outweigh any potential harms, especially the harms caused by coronavirus infection. And the CDC reports that coronavirus patients have 16 times the risk for developing myocarditis compared to people who are uninfected. There may be some risks associated with the vaccine, but these are highly effective vaccines in preventing the COVID itself. And that provides a lot of offsetting benefits, both for myocarditis and for the wide range of other things that are prevented as a result of taking the vaccine."
Covid Vaccine Division Altering Interpersonal Dynamics,NBC News,2021-09-05,IqWR8ISi2Lw,"Jenny Gimbe was already planning a small wedding when we get a text message one day that says, Hey, full disclosure, we're not vaccinated. We're not going to get vaccinated. And we don't like wearing masks. Her wedding got smaller. We uninvited them. We have immunocompromised family members that are going to be there and there's three nurses in my family who that drama that I just did not care to have across the country. Many are faced with similar decisions. Choosing sides and canceling plans with loved ones divided over the COVID vaccine. Every social interaction. Yeah, it's different because of this. Don Driscoll has also changed plans, not seeing some friends who might take issue with his unvaccinated status. I did recently make a trip and there were a few friends that I specifically did not tell I was in town. Because I felt like it would have come up. He says he takes precautions and thinks he will eventually get the vaccine, but he wants it to be his decision. Why I'm kind of hanging out. Following the science and I'm not anti vaccine. I'm just. Not in a rush just over half of Americans are now fully vaccinated, but with more places now requiring proof of vaccinations, the social divide could soon grow. Experts do have some advice. So COVID conflicts don't tear apart families and friendships clearly communicate and set boundaries. Check politics at the door. This doesn't have to be partisan and be kind. Even if you can't come to an understanding, you may need to agree to disagree and keep some distance for now if you want a relationship that lasts past the pandemic. Kristen dogren NBC News."
Conspiracy Theorists Think Covid Vaccine Makes You Magnetic,MSNBC,2021-06-09,qWI0YiSmTKs,"Last thing before we go tonight, the trained crazy town made an unscheduled whistle stop in Ohio this week. You're about to hear from a doctor and a nurse medical professionals who have had contact with patients. They happen to be anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. You've no doubt heard the conspiracy theory that they are injecting some sort of electronic tracking device in liquid form through a needle into our arms, but this at a committee hearing in the Ohio legislature, this was next level. Is it a combination of the protein which now we're finding has a metal attached to it? I'm sure you've seen the pictures all over the internet of people who've had these shots and now they're magnetized and put a key on their forehead at sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them and they can stick because now we think that there's a metal piece to that. There's been people who've long suspected that there was some sort of an interface to get to be defined in the interface between what's being injected in these shots and all of the 5G towers. Yes, vaccines do harm people. By the way, so I just found out something when I was on lunch and I want to show it to you. We were talking about Dr. Tenpenney's testimony about magnetic vaccine crystals. So this is what I found out. So I have a key and a bobby pin here. Explain to me why the key sticks to me. It sticks to my neck too. Got this. Yeah, so if somebody could explain this, that would be great. Any questions? Yeah, so many questions. And while the demonstration didn't work out as well as she had planned, on the upside, it launched so many memes, some of them downright artistic and a number of people applauded the convenience of being magnetized when you're going through your house and you can't find your keys. Now that we've had our fun though, this is what anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists sound like. It's all crap and in pandemic times, it's actually a danger to public health. And remember, the Russians give it a boost on social media because weakened adversaries are better for them. And at the end of the day, our parents were right. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt. That is our broadcast for this Wednesday night with our thanks for being here with us on behalf of all of our colleagues at the networks of NBC News. Good night."
First Doses of Pfizer Covid Vaccine On The Move | NBC Nightly News,NBC News,2020-12-13,f73-MKIVrx0,"Tonight, the first doses of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine are on the move across the U.S. applause marking the milestone D-Day. Some people assume that I meant day of distribution. In fact, D-Day in military designates the day the mission begins. This is a historic moment. The first trucks carrying the vaccine pulling out of the Pfizer plant escorted by U.S. marshals. It's the moment so many Americans have been waiting for after such a devastating year that's taken the lives of nearly 300,000 people across this country. The urgent work inside the plant began before dawn. This a rare look at the painstaking process. Hundreds of subartic freezers holding the potentially life-saving vaccine. Trays of vials carefully packed into boxes and shipping containers filled with dry ice. The vapors, a searing reminder of just how tough this mission is. Gingerly rushing a medical marvel to all 50 states at 80 degrees below zero. Michigan teacher Pamela I'd looked on with her family and fought back tears. Because it feels like there's finally a beginning to the end of this. The rollout came as the CDC director signed off on an advisory panel's recommendation to use Pfizer's vaccine for people 16 and older. It's an extraordinary day for science. It's an extraordinary day for humanity. Mike McDermott of Pfizer compares this to the space race. He says a half million doses rolled out today, roughly two million more by the end of the week. Right now the U.S. has a contract for 100 million doses that should last through early next year. In discussions with the U.S. government and we look forward to another 100 million doses.

Elderly Man Dies Shortly After Receiving COVID Vaccine At Javits Center,CBS New York,2021-02-08,LGtmV2Cfqks,"state health officials are investigating after an elderly man dies shortly after receiving a COVID vaccine. CBS News, Andre, Klein Tom is joining us on the Javits Center on the West side with more on what happened. Andre, well, Mary saddling that man collapse outside of the Javits Center as he was leaving his appointment, but it is important to stress it and the man in his 70s who has not been identified, collapsed 25 minutes after receiving the COVID vaccine Sunday morning. He died a short time later at the hospital. The man showed no signs of distress or adverse reactions during his 15 minute observation period after getting the shot according to the state health commissioner. Until we know more about detailed medical history of this patient or the state health officials have had something similar happen. We won't really know what caused it. Nearly one million people in New York city alone have been vaccinated. Adverse reactions are extremely rare. And in those few cases usually involve allergic reactions. So far it's been extraordinarily safe. I mean we're around the world with more than one hundred percent of the number of people who have been vaccinated. And the medical examiner is leading the investigation that's already underway. We meantime vaccination appointments are still happening here at the Javits Center and at sites all across the city.

COVID Vaccine  How it works,BJC HealthCare,2021-01-21,d5lX3B0vviU,"This is a cartoon of what the coronavirus looks like, magnified thousands of times. From this picture, you can see where it gets its name because it looks like a crown of thorns, and corona literally means crown and matten. These thorns in the viruses crown are actually called spike proteins, and they really are the virus's key weapon to attack our bodies by attaching onto cells and invading them. Last January, scientists from China published the genetic code for the virus on the internet so that folks from around the world could start working on it. You see these little squiggles here represent the genetic information for the virus. Scientists basically copied a tiny part of it that's responsible for making the spike protein. The other term you've heard for this little piece of genetic material is mRNA, which stands for messenger RNA, hence the mRNA vaccines. I like to think of the mRNA vaccines like a fortune cookie. You have this messenger RNA to tell the body, makes the spike proteins. But the mRNA is fragile and it gets broken down quickly, so we wrap it inside a ball of fat for my fortune cookie, so it lasts long enough to get injected in our bodies and get the message to ourselves to start making those spike proteins. Simply put, the vaccine, or my fortune cookie, with the mRNA wrapped in a little ball of fat to protect it, gets injected in our muscle, tells our bodies to produce the spike protein, and then our immune system sees it as something foreign that deserves to be attacked and starts ramping up our immune system to make antibodies. These are the little soldiers our immune system makes to fight infections, so our antibody soldiers learn how to fight off the coronavirus spikes without ever having to be infected with the actual coronavirus. So just having the spike protein around gets us all of the benefits of having immunity without all of those nasty consequences associated with getting infected with the actual virus."
Study compares COVID vaccine with immunity from infection,CBS News,2023-02-20,DCzmtt5-b3A,"All right, so a new study finds that COVID-19 immunity, the natural kind caused by getting the virus and then beating it can be just as protective as getting a vaccine. The study published in the Lancet found infection generated immunity can cut the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 by up to 88 percent for up to 10 months. Dr. Stanley Perlman joins us now with more. He's a distinguished chair at the University of Iowa, speaking of Iowa in the departments of microbiology, immunology and pediatrics. Thank you very much for being here, Dr.. Your big takeaways from the study. Well, first thank you for having me. My takeaways from the study are really that natural infection works pretty well in preventing hospitalization and subsequent re-challenge. This is not a complete surprise. This is what we expect immunity to infections to do. The parts of this study that I think raise questions or that are interesting is the question of how does it compare to vaccination? And what this study does is it compares protection for those who have been immunized with the basic two shot series versus this reinfection and the reinfection does a little better. But I think as we all know now, people have received boosters, particularly the first boosters considered very important for protection. And the second booster may help some, particularly against the new Omicron type variants. So you put this all together. Sorry, go ahead. Well, I was going to say it sounds like you were building to it. I mean, bottom line, do people still need to get boosters and vaccines if they've already had the virus and therefore have immunity? Yes, so I think that that is the question. And I think it has to be a new on-stanza because what we know is that for many people being infected and occasion and maybe being re-boosted by getting the infection again may protect them. But for their groups for whom this is not true, people who have never been infected or vaccinated can still get very severe disease. And we have to remember that this was the strategy that was used in Sweden initially. And what it ended up with was a lot of people dying because the infection is still bad. We still have 500 people a day dying in the US. And most of those people are either babies who have never been vaccinated or older people whose immunity isn't great or people who don't have a good immune system. Now, Dr. Pearlman, this study did not include hybrid immunity, which is, I understand it comes when someone contracts the virus and is also fully vaccinated. Is that, I guess, the ideal level of protection? I don't know what ideal is. I think if one is vaccinated, if one has been infected and it's done well and then vaccinated, that seems to work well. The reverse seems to be good as well. But the challenge with this virus is even with immunity, whether it be from a natural infection or from vaccination, people are still getting reinfected. So they're not going to the hospital and they're not dying, but there's still lots of infections around. That's right. Well, Dr. Stanley Pearlman, thank you so much. Yeah, thank you. My pleasure. Thank you."
Growing Backlash Over Covid Vaccine Mandate,NBC News,2021-09-12,-ZW4T0L38J8,"Tonight, growing backlash over President Biden's vaccine mandate, at least 19 Republican governors denouncing the rule, requiring businesses with at least 100 employees to make COVID shots mandatory or offer weekly testing. The president's actions in a mandate hardens the resistance. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis promising a fight. People should not be cast aside because they make a medical decision for themselves. President Biden calling opposition Cavalier, adding all federal workers and contractors should be vaccinated within 75 days or face fines. The requirements for vaccination are part of a long tradition that we have in this country of taking steps as a collective to keep people safe. But fallout underway. In New York, the mandate forcing one hospital to turn away expectant mothers after staff members quit. The number of resignations received leaves us no choice but to pause delivering babies at Lewis County General Hospital. In North Carolina, business owner Stephen Bullock feels stuck. It's a fight every day. The vaccination rate of his 125 employees, about 40 percent. Now he fears some quitting to work somewhere smaller where the mandate doesn't apply. Have you found anything that is capable of changing someone's mind at this point? Frankly, I have not. Folks are really dug in and it seems the harder you try, the further they go. And yet major corporations in favor, companies like Amazon, Home Depot and Walmart say they welcome the plan. The hope drive down US COVID cases as they start to plateau. Americans now down 10 percent from their peak during the latest wave driven by the Delta variant. Doctors say there are three main reasons why increased use of masks indoors, a study rise in vaccination rates and the virus burns through until there's no one else to infect. And Morgan's with us Morgan are there other reasons why doctors say the numbers are slightly going down? Okay, doctor say it comes down to this combination of more people getting vaccinated and unfortunately more infection because when you combine the two, that leads to more immune Americans. And important to note, the seven day average for vaccinations now sitting at a million doses administered every day. Thanks for watching our YouTube channel.

An update on neurological adverse events from COVID-19 vaccines,VJNeurology,2022-07-11,g_8N3CczKEg,"We took a look at the VAERS data set, which is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. It's co-managed by the FDA and the CDC. And it's just a publicly available data. So you can go to the CDC website and just download this gigantic data set for hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports. It's a passive reporting system, which means that anybody can put their reports in. So it could be the average person on the street entering an adverse event. It could be a nurse, it could be a doctor, etc. And there's nobody policing this site, right? I mean, there's consequences. You can't go file a false report. It's technically punishable by law. But the data is not reviewed and cleaned. There are certain things that people have to report. There's certain adverse events, clinicians must report. And industry who has produced these vaccines is required to report their adverse events into this system also. So there's limitations to the system, but it's also robust because it has a high number of patients and adverse events reported. So we looked at this. There were 314,000 adverse events that we looked at over about a six and a half month period from January of 2021 to mid-June of 2021. So when the vaccines first were rolled out in the United States. And we only looked at FDA approved vaccines. So that would be the MRNA vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna. And then the Johnson, Janssen, J&J vaccine as the adenovirus vector vaccine that we have that's approved here. And so what we found overall is that neurological events are very uncommon post-vaccination. The things that had already been identified by the CDC as possible relationships between the vaccine and adverse event, namely, cerebral sinusrombosis and the ombarase syndrome, were happen at higher frequency than what you would expect in the baseline population following the Johnson vaccination. What we also did find was that there was a higher frequency of seizures happening after the Johnson or J&J vaccine than what you would normally expect in the population in terms of baseline seizure rates. That was novel kind of thing that we reported. But if you look at the original trials that led to the approval of the J&J vaccine, there was a higher risk of seizure in the patients that received the vaccine compared to the placebo group. And that sort of did bear out in this kind of, you know, quattonary type of study or real world study. But overall, most serious events happen in less than one in a million people. So very, very uncommon. And most of them, besides the three I mentioned, related to the Johnson vaccine, did not happen at a higher frequency than what you would just generally expect to occur in the population. When we looked at, you know, COVID itself, the neurological events related to COVID itself occur 500 times more often than after a vaccine, for example. So you're much higher risk if you get COVID of having a neurological event than after a vaccine."
Moderna Covid Vaccine Update: Is the Moderna Vaccine Safe? Allergic Reactions and Side Effects,Doctor Mike Hansen,2021-01-05,Uv3REjrZDio,"Is the Moderna vaccine safe? What are the side effects? Allergic reactions? Guillain-Barracin drone? Bell's paulzy? Let's break it down in this video. So the Moderna, they took the genetic code from the SARS coronavirus-2 virus. They identified the section that codes for the spike protein, the protein that binds to the human ACE2 receptor. And they used this mRNA sequence for its vaccine. Short additional genetic sequences were added to both ends to help stabilize this mRNA. The mRNA strands are encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle. What is especially nice about messenger RNA vaccines is that there are no weakened, killed or gutted viral particles in the vaccine, making it much safer for those who are immunocompromised. And this vaccine is 95 percent effective. So like the Pfizer Bio-antech vaccine, there are two doses with the Moderna vaccine. They're administered on days one and day 29. So it's a little bit different from Pfizer Pfizer's first one, and then you get the second one three weeks later. So very similar. Once the messenger RNA vaccine is injected, human cells, they use the mRNA code to produce the viral spike protein, but not the other 20 proteins required to make a SARS-CoV-2 virus. Without the complete genetic code, the SARS-CoV-2 virus can't be manufactured in a human being. Once the viral spike protein is produced, the human immune system recognizes it as foreign. Then there's a series of complicated immune processes, including the production of antibodies that are triggered, and that's what allows your body to fight off that virus in the future. So in the New England Journal of Medicine, Moderna enrolled over 30,000 volunteers, age 18 and older, and it's a double-blinded placebo controlled study. 11,000 were from communities of color, 7,000 were 65 and older, and there were 5,000 that were under the age of 65, but they had conditions that were considered risk factors for severe COVID. Half the people received the vaccine, half the people received placebo. So 15,000 in placebo group, 15,000 who got the vaccine. Symptomatic COVID-19 was confirmed in 185 people in the placebo group, and only 11 in the vaccinated group. So that's a 94.1 percent efficacy. Now researchers actively monitored the vaccine recipients for local and systemic side effects for seven days after vaccination, and they recorded unsolicited side effects for 28 days, and more severe side effects and medically attended adverse events from day one all the way through day 759, which means it's continuing to be monitored. Let's first start off by talking about the local side effects. So injection site reactions in the seven days after the first vaccination dose that occurred in 84 percent of the vaccinated group, and that's compared to 20 percent in the placebo. After the second dose, 89 percent of the vaccinated group and 19 percent of the unvaccinated group recorded injection side effects. Overall, the vaccine side effects were rated as mild to moderate in severity, and the last set an average of 2.6 and 3.2 days after the first and second vaccine doses, respectively. The most common local side effect was injection site pain, that was reported 84 percent and 88 percent in the vaccinated group after the first and second vaccine dose, respectively. Injection site pain was reported by 20 percent and 17 percent of the placebo group after the first and second dose. The average duration of pain was two days after the first dose, and three days after the second. Swollen axillary lymph nodes, meaning lymph nodes and your armpits, they were swollen in 21 percent of people under the age of 65 and 12 percent of people over the age of 65 in the vaccine group, and then it was about 5 percent and 4 percent of individuals in the placebo group. The median duration of swelling was one day after the first dose in two days after the second. Other local side effects were uncommon, such as redness in swelling at the injection site. So what about systemic side effects? Just like with the Pfizer vaccine, systemic side effects were more common after the second vaccine with 55 percent reporting a systemic side effect after the first dose and 79 percent after the second dose in the vaccine group. In the placebo group, 42 percent had side effects that were systemic after the first dose and 37 percent after the second dose. The most commonly reported systemic adverse event was fatigue, now is at 69 percent of the vaccine group and 36 percent of the placebo. And that fatigue lasted for about a couple days. Headache was reported in 63 percent in the vaccine group and then 37 percent in the placebo group. Muscle pain was reported 60 percent in the vaccine, 20 percent in the placebo group. Now in the vaccine group, 45 percent reported joint pain compared to 17 percent in placebo. Then there was other things that occurred less frequently, but more commonly in the vaccine group, such as chills and fever. About half of those in the vaccinated group reported systemic side effects starting at 15 hours after vaccination with no long-term side effects. Systemic reactions lasting longer than seven days were about 12 percent in the vaccine, and that's compared to 10 percent in the placebo, so by the same in both groups. Severe adverse reactions defined as those that prevent normal daily activities. That was 0.2 to 7.7 percent of participants overall. Fewer than 1 percent of vaccine recipients reported fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit. Severe fatigue was reported in 7.7 of vaccine recipients, muscle pain in 6.1, joint pain in 3.7, and headache in 4.4. Severe adverse reactions were more frequently reported after the second vaccine dose, and less commonly in the groups that were over 65 years old. Systemic side effects are expected as the immune system responds to foreign viral proteins, so a decrease in reactogenicity is expected in older adults as aging, brings about a gradual deterioration in the immune response. However, the immune response or reactogenicity of the immune system to the Moderna vaccine may be more than most people have previously experienced with other vaccines. So in summary, just like with Pfizer, those who were younger, less than age of 65, they had more frequent mild to moderate side effects compared to the older groups. The safety profile was similar across age groups, genders, ethnic and racial groups, participants with or without colmorid conditions, and participants with or without evidence of prior COVID infection. These systemic side effects are unpleasant and are at a higher rate than seen in most vaccines, and in most cases, they're more likely related to the lipid nanoparticles that have super tiny amounts of polyethylene glycol. Moderna reported no anaphylactic or severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, but a hypersensitivity reaction was reported in 1.5 percent of vaccine recipients, and that's compared to 1.1 percent of placebo recipients. The FDA's website has the list of ingredients found in all vaccines and advises that people with a history of severe allergic reactions check the list and discuss the risk of vaccination with their own doctor. So there was a Boston physician who had a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine. He did have a history of having allergic reaction to shellfish, and he was rushed to the emergency room he was treated and released. Also, it was initially recommended that pregnant women or those who intend to become pregnant in three months should not get the vaccine due to the lack of their inclusion in the studies, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist has recently released a statement supporting vaccination for both pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. Bell's palsy was observed in three people in the vaccinated group and one in the placebo group. Bell's palsy is a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis in the muscles on one side of the face. It's frequently a reaction to a viral infection. A recent study in Italy reported that out of 38 people presenting to a local ER for symptoms that were consistent with Bell's palsy, 21 percent had COVID-19. In 2019, at that same ER, 22 people were treated for Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy usually resolves on its own within six months. The incidence of Bell's palsy as a side effect from the vaccine will be tracked compared to the incidence of Bell's palsy in the unvaccinated population. Gianne-Barray syndrome, which is a neurological disorder that can cause muscle weakness or even paralysis, has not been reported during coronavirus vaccine clinical trials. In general, the advisory committee on immunization practices does not list a history of Gianne-Barray syndrome as a general vaccination precaution. With the latest guideline, the only people who should not get the vaccine are those who are known to be allergic to any of his ingredients, which is a cut off that holds true for every single medical product. Ingredients include lipid nanoparticles and polyethylene glycol, inafalactic reactions can occur with any vaccine, but are usually extremely rare, about 1 per 1 million doses. As of December 19, the United States has seen six cases of inafalaxis among 272 thousand people who received the COVID-19 vaccine, and there were two recorded cases in the UK. As with everything we do, whether it's driving a car to eating a food that could potentially be allergenic, we have to weigh the risks versus the benefits. And when it comes to COVID-19, the risks of getting COVID-19 and the potential consequences that come with that far outweigh the risks that come from the vaccine itself."
British Woman Becomes The First To Receive Clinically Approved Covid Vaccine | NBC Nightly News,NBC News,2020-12-08,T2ekJAs9HPQ,"At 6.31 this morning, a grandmother in a donated Christmas sweater made history. 90-year-old Margaret Keenan became patient A, the first person in the world to receive a clinically tested and proven COVID vaccine. It's fine. It's fine. I wasn't nervous at all. The second recipient was 81-year-old William Shakespeare, no relation to the Bard. I'm breaking, I think. It could make a difference to our lives from now on, couldn't it? At around 70 hospitals across the UK today, the counter-attack against the coronavirus began. British officials have declared this V-Day for vaccination day, a vacative of the victorious V-E and V-J days of World War II. It's been such a tough year for so many people and it makes me proud to be British. The nurse who gave the first shot, May Parsons, told me this is the start of a new chapter. People will hopefully get all day normal back from normal lives, Mark. I think that's a good thing to look forward to. They're starting off slowly at this hospital alone there, planning to do just around 100 vaccinations today, but then to ramp that up to 400 vaccinations a day next week and keep it going seven days a week. Keenan, who worked in a jewelry shop up until just four years ago, is doing well and has a message to others. I stay at GoFers. GoFers because it's great and it's the best thing to do stuff happen. The road ahead is long, but today the UK and patient A left the starting blocks without a stumble. Richard Engel, NBC News, Coventry. Data Center Views show highlights and digital exclusives.

Long Lines And Overwhelming Demand For Covid Vaccine | NBC Nightly News,NBC News,2020-12-31,v8b75GwP_Hc,"In Florida, those 65 and older and health care workers exasperated by the vaccine rollout here. Those who are eligible for the first round of shots waiting up to eight hours in first come first served lines. I play more whole government. I mean, I totally play more government that this is this is not, but it should be. I did not expect to be sitting here since 345 this morning. In Florida, one in five of this dates, 21 million residents is 65 or older. The demand for vaccines overwhelming officials and fort Myers today defending their plan of first come first served. Could it be more efficient? You betcha we were the first to admit that it gets better every day and it's going to be better next week than it was this week. Taking appointments with its own set of problems in Fort Lauderdale when Broward Health announced anyone 65 or older could get a shot. The phone lines crashed. The problem nationwide in Tennessee today, a miles long traffic jam for people waiting for a vaccine. State officials blamed the federal government. One, two, three. Operation warp speed passed responsibility of administering the vaccine to state and local health departments, which are underfunded and for the last nine months have been focused on getting people tested for the virus. The former commissioner of health in New Jersey. If we're not able to get through that first phase as fast as possible, that's going to push the whole chain down in terms of time. And as we're seeing every day means lives, thousands of lives. And in Wisconsin, a pharmacist fired and arrested tonight after allegations of intentionally contaminating 500 doses of the vaccine by taking the vials out of a refrigerator. Tonight in Florida, a member of the state cabinet is calling on the governor to call in the National Guard to take over vaccine distribution to fix the chaos. So far, no indication that will happen."
Florida county votes to ban the COVID-19 vaccine,CBS Miami,2023-02-23,xfZuMQmyb30,"In Lee County, the band, the jab, passed with a majority vote and now heads, the heads, it's going to head to Governor Ron DeSantis's desk. The resolution calls on the governor to ban the sale and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This comes after a member of the Lee County Republican Party wrote a resolution for the executive committee to consider. Joe Sandsone argues the risks of the COVID vaccine are just not worth it. Sandsone went as far as to label the vaccine as a bio-weapon. The Lee County Republican Party is going to be on the vanguard of this campaign to stop the genocide because we have foreign, non-governmental entities that are unleashing biological weapons on American people. Well, because the Republican Party of Lee County has no power per se, the governor can just ignore it."
Covid vaccine deadline today for U.S. military,CNBC Television,2021-12-15,3OXJlRrXmQc,"They're not, they could face serious consequences, including being discharged. The vaccine deadline already passed for the Marines, the Navy, the Space Force and the Air Force. Monday, the Air Force announced it discharged 27 who refused to get vaccinated. NBC's Courtney Cuby, on the Pentagon's push to get shots and arms. Chef, today is the deadline for all active-duty US Army soldiers to be vaccinated for COVID. Now, we don't have the final numbers for exactly how many US troops may not have met today's deadline. But according to some preliminary numbers that we got from defense officials, somewhere in the neighborhood of 97 to 98 percent of all US soldiers did get their COVID vaccine by today's deadline. Now, keep in mind, Chef, the entire US Army is more than 480,000 soldiers. So, 2 to 3 percent is still thousands of individuals. But of those remaining troops who didn't get the vaccine in time, about 1 percent, a little bit more than that, are actually in an exemption process. So, there are several different ways that troops can be exempted from getting the vaccine. One is a medical waiver and a medical exemption, and the other is a religious one. But we also know that so far only three medical waivers have been granted, and no religious waivers have been granted. So, the reality is, the majority of those who are in that process probably will not get their exemption that they've applied for. So, that still leaves somewhere in the neighborhood of thousands of troops who have not got their vaccine who didn't meet the deadline. The reality is, they will be counseled by their leadership. But if they continue to refuse to get the vaccine, they can be processed for administrative separation. We've already seen that happen in the Air Force. We will likely see that happen to some troops in the US Army as well."
Israel moves toward 4th COVID vaccine shot,ABC News,2021-12-22,8EciQDzPdvI,"This morning, countries around the world are racing to fight the spread of Omicron. The highly contagious variant now reshaping the pandemic. Israel is now preparing to distribute a fourth dose of the vaccine for people over age 60. The Prime Minister tweeting, as we did with the booster and the Delta surge, we intend to be active and groundbreaking. Adding, the world will follow us. Even before the rise of Omicron, I think we knew that it was going to need to be at least one more round of boosters. But Omicron's kind of very swift spread across the country means that it could be coming here in the next few months. Doctors say it appears Omicron can evade vaccines, but a booster shot restores protection. The FDA is expected to authorize pills to treat COVID made by Pfizer and Merck. And according to Bloomberg, that authorization could come as soon as today. Well, I want this to be over. On Tuesday, President Biden outlined his plan to fight the surge in cases, including the deployment of 1000 military personnel, to help overwhelmed hospitals and new federal testing sites, along with the distribution of 500 million free at home COVID tests. The spike in infections just days before Christmas is fueling massive demand for testing. These vehicles snaking around a drive-through testing site in Miami. And from New York to Los Angeles, people waited in these lines for hours. It's pretty busy in their hand, but it moves. But this morning, the White House is offering few specifics on how the free at-home tests will be distributed. Only saying Americans will be able to order them through a website next month. And that website will be able to handle high demand. Reporters pressed the president on whether the shortage of testing is a failure for the administration. No, it's not because COVID is spreading so rapidly. If you notice, it just happened almost overnight, just in the last month. Many health officials are now criticizing Biden for claiming this surge of cases was not anticipated. Many of us did predict that we would have a winter surge, even though we didn't know this specifics of Omicron. And for more than a year, many of us have been calling for a significantly ramped up home testing that is that we were nowhere near. Demand for testing is so high right now, chains like CVS and Walgreens are now limiting the number of at-home tests that customers can buy. For breaking news alerts, thanks for watching."
"RNA Vaccines (mRNA Vaccine) - Basis of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, Animation",Alila Medical Media,2020-11-18,oMXGGmBfkf8,"Vaccines prepare the immune system, getting it ready to fight disease-causing organisms called pathogens. A vaccine is introduced to the body to mimic infection, triggering the body to produce antibodies against the pathogen, but without causing the illness. Conventional vaccines usually contain a weakened or inactivated pathogen, or a piece of a protein produced by the pathogen called an antigen. RNA vaccines are a new generation of vaccines. Instead of the antigen itself, RNA vaccines contain a messenger RNA, mRNA, that encodes for the antigen. Once inside the body's cells, the mRNA is translated into protein, the antigen, by the same process the cells use to make their own proteins. The antigen is then displayed on the cell surface where it is recognized by the immune system. From here, the sequence of events is similar to that of a conventional vaccine. Some RNA vaccines also contain additional mRNA coding for an enzyme, which, after being translated in host cells, can generate multiple copies of the antigen encoding mRNA. This essentially amplifies the production of antigen from a small amount of vaccine, making the vaccine more effective. These are called self-amplifying RNA vaccines. RNA vaccines are easier and safer to produce than conventional vaccines. This is because mRNA molecules can be synthesized in a cell-free system using a DNA template with a sequence of the pathogen, while conventional vaccines usually require a more complicated and risk-prone process of growing large amounts of infectious pathogens in chicken eggs or other mammalian cells. Without the risks of being contaminated by infectious elements or allergens from egg cultures, RNA vaccines are also safer for patients. Because protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm, RNA molecules do not need to enter the nucleus, so the possibility of them integrating into the host cell genome is low. RNA strands are usually degraded by cellular enzymes once the protein is made. The relative simplicity of the production process makes it easier to standardize and scale, enabling rapid responses to emerging pandemics. Other advantages include lower production costs and the ease of tweaking RNA sequences to adapt to rapidly mutating pathogens. On the minus side, it can be challenging to deliver mRNA effectively to the cells, since RNA sequences and secondary structures may be recognized and destroyed by the innate immune system as soon as they are administered intravenously. These limitations can be overcome by optimizing codons, using modified nucleosides to avoid recognition and packaging RNA into protective nanoparticles. Another disadvantage is that most RNA vaccines require uninterrupted refrigeration for transportation and storage, which can be a hurdle for vaccine distribution. Research is ongoing to engineer thermostable vaccines."
Why Moderna Doesn't Own Its Covid Vaccine,CNBC,2022-01-22,ljod8p5l8yQ,"COVID vaccines have changed the course of the pandemic. They prevented over 1 million deaths in the US and over 10.3 million hospitalizations in 2021. But what's equally impressive was the speed and efficiency in which they were created. I have never seen the level of a 10th-said collaboration like wanting to try and figure this out between in public private partnership form in my 20 year group. However, the groundbreaking collaboration might be giving way to another looming battle on the horizon. A battle over who truly owns the COVID vaccine. We're following a developing story. Moderna, the drug maker, locked in a fight with the NIH over its COVID vaccine. These two entities have essentially been partners on the COVID vaccine, but now they are in a battle over one of the key patents behind it. Patterns have historically been viewed as important in part because they assure the company that if they are successful in getting the drug to market that they stand to have essentially a monopoly on the rights to sell that drug for a certain period of time typically say around 20 years. Whenever there's a blockbuster drug, there are disputes about who owns it, who owns variations of it, who owns it for how long, and in what context. We are likely to see these battles playing out in the US courts and in international courts for a long time to come. Controversy over COVID vaccine patents has grabbed the attention of the world and the likes of President Biden and Bill Gates. And its outcome could have ramifications on how the world ends the pandemic. Like any other invention, vaccines are often covered by patents that provide legal protection against imitation. That's because investing in pharmaceutical research can be an expensive and risky gamble. On average, developing a new drug can range from less than $1 billion to more than $2 billion per drug, yet just under 14 percent of all drugs and clinical trials eventually went approval from the FDA to make their way to the market. There are tons and tons of research and development or patents or papers or initiatives that could spun up that never really go anywhere that don't really see light of day. I did a general search, Google patents, anybody can do this, look at vaccines for COVID, right? I found one that's known. I just lose that. How many other patents are sort of kind of like that? The number that's got spit out on Google patents was 134,000 patents. You would never know, never seen them, never heard about them, that all were somehow related to research in the area that led ultimately to that patent that salt market. A successful patent, however, can often result in a big payoff. Not only does it give the inventor the sole right to produce and sell their products, but it also allows them to earn royalties whenever their patent is used to create a product. Patents have historically been presented as a way to reward a company that has developed and brought a drug to the market and to compensate it for all of the costs that were incurred and getting it to the market. They stand to have essentially a monopoly on the rights to sell that drug for a certain period of time, typically say around 20 years. Law suits over invaluable pharmaceutical patents have been common throughout history. A fair percentage of the litigation that happens in the United States relates to pharmaceutical patents. Our legal system spends a lot of time trying to figure out who owns what and what are the boundaries of those rights. Pharmaceutical patents, if they lead particularly to blockbuster medicines, have a lot of money at stake. So that means there are a lot of resources to hire lawyers to try to argue over who owns what. In November 2021, a similar conflict broke out over the COVID-19 vaccine, putting Moderna at odds with the US government. Moderna collaborated with the researchers at the National Institute of Health, a federal agency to develop their vaccine spikebacks. When Moderna excluded the NIH researchers as co-inventors, an essential patent covering the mRNA sequence, NIH publicly challenged the patent, arguing that three of its scientists made meaningful contributions to its research. When you have large industry, you have government, and you're trying to blend commercial interest with governmental do good interest, there's always going to be some kind of natural tension. And that's to be expected. They are arguing over methods of stabilizing the spike protein within the vaccine. So it's critically important to the minute of vaccine who actually owns that. If the government is listed on the patent, then it has remarkable control over what the parties can do with it. While Moderna eventually backed down in their fight against the NIH, the dispute could foreshadow more to come. Another dispute can potentially rise over NIH's patent for the spike protein that allows the vaccine to reduce a stronger immune response. While companies like Pfizer paid money to obtain a license from NIH, Moderna did not. Moderna could also be facing another patent infringement lawsuit by Arbitus Biofarmacorp, a company with a similar patent on its delivery system. Multiple reports surrounding Moderna's patent complications haven't helped with the company's dwindling performance in the market. In October 2020, Pfizer was also sued by a lab biotechnology and pharmaceuticals for allegedly using their proteins in their vaccine testing that infringed on their existing patent. I do anticipate going forward that we're going to see more lawsuits and disputes arise over COVID-19 vaccine patents. I think at some level, it's pretty much unavoidable. We are likely to see these battles playing out in the US courts, and in international courts for a long time to come. The COVID vaccine patents can also pose other threats beyond legal conflict. Patents within the US also extend throughout the world, thanks to an international agreement known as trips. Some experts argue this is why vaccines are less accessible in lower-income countries. The existence of patents and specifically intellectual property protections does two things. One is it limits how much manufacturing there can be of that product or that vaccine. And the other thing that it does is it keeps the price of that product in vaccine artificially high or keeps it high enough that it limits the ability of other countries in the world, particularly low-middle-income countries, to be able to purchase those vaccines. In response, calls to waive the patents on COVID vaccines have continuously gained traction throughout the world. Some of the recent ideas that have been floated include things known as patent waivers, which is basically saying, okay, you may have a patent, but we're going to administratively say that patent no longer gives you protection to market. You have to give your rest to the other way to everybody. And in Africa, get more vaccines out there, tell them to get us as a global economy back on barefooting. In October 2020, India and South Africa first brought the matter to the spotlight after formally proposing the WTO to waive intellectual property rules over the COVID vaccines. While patents might have a place in the normal world, the hope is that the pandemic could force countries to consider an exception. Until we have full vaccination around the world, we're going to continue to see new variants arise. And every time there's a new variant, we're going to realize very quickly that it's not possible to contain that variant in just one part of the world. The world can't wait. It certainly can't wait 20 years of the patent to end, but it can't even wait for the period of time necessary to get through the existing waiver processes. There is also the question of ethics. The US government played a major role in funding the vaccine. Research from 2021 discovered that most of the technology used for the COVID vaccine was mostly funded by the public sector. So is it ethical for drug companies to make a profit off of their patents? The reason that public investment happens is that we're trying to protect the public from new diseases, protect and improve the health of the public. And so I do think there are some major concerns with specific companies making large amounts of profits from drugs that were developed in part with federal government support. And moreover, when the health of the public is also suffering at the same time. But not everyone is in support of a patent waiver. Critics argue that such an unprecedented move will only have dire consequences in the long run. If we made that slippery slope of patents are devalued because legally they're not protected anymore at a global level, we're going to be disincentivizing innovation at a massive, massive level. There is also conflicting opinion on whether a waiver can actually improve global vaccine distribution. Bill Gates also originally spoke out against the patent waiver, arguing that there are problems beyond patents that stay in the way of global vaccination, although he later reversed his position. If you don't have the actual healthcare infrastructure that can deliver those, you don't have the logistics and transportation components that are there, having a billion vaccines sitting in a warehouse of a lab that's developing it will do no good for citing getting your respect and normal. While the debate remains a hot topic among scholars throughout the world, many expressed doubts on whether a patent waiver can actually come to fruition. The likelihood that at a global level, because it's not a US decision, it's a global world and intellectual property organization decision to be clear, that we will get to a point where we're going to say, yeah, we're going to use a trip's waiver in this case. I doubt it very seriously. I think we have the best hope of it was last year when there was a proposal that was put forward at the WTO and the Biden administration had supported it, but we had European countries that objected to those patent waivers. No matter the outcome, the current debate over intellectual property will have a lasting impact on global public health. This is not the last pandemic, and it's not the last epidemic. We are going to face these questions of how we encourage innovation, how we make sure it spreads through the world in an accessible manner. These are issues that will play us long after COVID-19. Hopefully, God willing has been solved and we've learned to live with it."
Stroke and death after Moderna,Dr. John Campbell,2024-05-16,OLD3JIWqr6w,"Welcome to this talk Thursday the 16th of May. Now this is the paper I want to look at today. This is Fatal Post COVID mRNA vaccine associated cerebral ischemia. Seribule of course is to do with the brain. Ischemia is lack of blood supply and fatal means, I think you probably know what fatal means. This could not be a more serious report. So let's look at it and be careful and we'll give you the information from the report and you can say what you decide what you think it means. Now we'll look off, we'll start off with a few pictures first of all. So this is from this journal here, the new ORO hospitalist. So to do with new biology and things like that. Now this is the article here, Fatal Post COVID mRNA vaccine associated cerebral ischemia. Now this was the brain scan. Now I apologize for the resolution, it's all we've got from the PDF. But that was the relatively normalish. I think there is some changes in it, but you can't really see this resolution brain scan there. But then this patient, this was it eight days later. And you can see that this whole part of the brain doesn't look right at all. So that was just within an eight day period. There's another one there, this top scan was on admission. And this one was after an eight day period in a very pathological looking scan. For example, you can see a bit of ventricle there, but not on the other side. Now this was one of the blood vessels, I think in what you call the leptoman injuries. So the leptoman injuries are in three layers. The duramator, a racnoid meter and pionator surrounding the brain in the spinal cord. And the leptoman injuries are the two in at once, the racnoid meter and the pionator. And this is the blood vessel here. Now again, the resolution is not brilliant, but what we're seeing is lots of white cells, lymphocytes, I think these were around about the blood vessel. So quite abnormal situation. And here, this is a blood vessel here. We see organizing blockage. So that's the wall of the blood vessel. And then all this bit in the middle is the is the organized occlusion of the blood vessel that shouldn't shouldn't be there. So really quite significant pathology that we're looking at there. Now let's get down to the details and there we are. So key words here, COVID-19, Moderna vaccine. This is the Moderna vaccine we're talking about here. Sobhaid edema, edema is fluid and swelling. Neurology, sort of the disease of the nervous system and stroke, of course, part of the brain being cut off from its blood supply. Now, this is the full reference here that they author's like us to put in. So we'll put it there. Department of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Boston. So part of the Harvard Medical School group. Good that they're reporting on this. Now background, Venus Thornboses have been linked to several COVID vaccines as we know. So that's not really new. But here we describe a case of post-modern COVID-19 vaccine arterial infarct. So arterial infarct. So the arteries take blood to a particular part of the body. So that will be an artery there. And that's the part of the body that they're taking the blood to. If there's a blockage here, like a blood clot there, then the infarct is this area cut off from this blood supply. That will be the infarct. And of course, if that's the brain, that's going to be a stroke. With vaccine associated cortical, diffuse cortical edema. In other words, there was a edema that was in many different parts. It's diffuse cortical edema throughout the brain, swelling throughout the brain. That was complicated by refractory intracranial hypertension. So intracranial means within the bones of the skull intracranial. And hypertension means the blood pressure there is too high. So there's high pressure inside the cranial cavity. So the cerebrospinal fluid inside the cranial cavity, that's supposed to have a particular pressure, if that's too high, that is cranial hypertension. I blood, high fluid pressure inside the brain. And refractory means it didn't respond to any treatments. And they tried everything, all the medical treatments they tried, and they didn't work. So they couldn't get the high blood pressure, or the high pressure rather in the brain down. Case summary, 24 hours after receiving her. First dose of the Moderna vaccine, 30-year-old woman developed severe headache. Three weeks later she was admitted with subacute headache and confusion. So headache may be not quite severe, but she became confused. Imaging initially showed a scattered cortical thrombosis. That was the first one we saw. So brain supply lots of little blood clots in the vessel supplying the brain, with an elevated opening pressure on lumbar bronchia. So when they did lumbar bronchia, so what happened here is the... The cerebral spinal fluid goes round about the brain, and it goes down the spinal cord as well. So when you do a lumbar bronchia, if the cerebral spinal fluid is at high pressure, there's a high pressure down in the spine as well from the cerebral spinal fluid. It's called cerebral spinal because it goes round the subribum and round the part of the spinal cord as well. And an external ventricular drain was placed. So the ventricles there, these are the fluid fill gaps in the brain. They put a drain in there, but again that didn't work as well as they'd wanted to. But she continued to have elevated intra-cranial pressure, so the pressure stayed high. Ultimately she required a hemicraniaotomy. So otomy means opening into, hemimines half, and the cranium is the bones of the skull. So it sounds like what they did here was they actually, to try and get the pressure down, they actually took away some of the side of the bone of the skull to try and get the pressure down. Pretty drastic, pretty drastic stuff, but sadly to no avail, unfortunately. Pathology was consistent with thrombosis and associated inflammatory response. The conclusion. Through correlation, her medical team surmised the mRNA vaccine may have contributed to this presentation. So it's just coincidence, but her medical team surmised that being very cautious here, that the mRNA vaccine may have contributed to this presentation. From what I've said, let me know what you think. So it may have contributed towards it, might have just been in the Paul & Co incidents. The side effects of COVID-19 infection and vaccination are still completely understood. Though complications are rare, clinicians should be aware of presentations like this one, they say. Rare, of course, is a somewhat relative term. Now, a bit more information for those that want it. This patient had a priorase symptomatic COVID-19 infection three months earlier. So if she'd had infection three months earlier, you and me might think she had high levels of natural immunity, and the vaccine would no longer be indicated, especially that she was a young woman. But the vaccine was given anyway. And this is a big part of the problem here. These are group protocols. Everyone's given the same treatment. In this case, the vaccine, regardless of looking at the individual. Now, I think there should be a ban on all vaccines until we know with much more certainty their effects and adverse reactions. But even if you don't go that far, then surely should be giving these vaccines on individualised bespoke basis, not for everyone. Because this person had just had the infection. Therefore, would probably have high levels of natural immunity. By 24 hours after the first dose of the mRNA COVID vaccine, Moderna, developed severe atypical throbbing bifronto head XO in an usual throbbing pain over the front of her head, bifronto, but left and right side. Head XO atypical, she hadn't had headaches in the past. So this was new. If it was not the vaccine, it was a very unfortunate coincidence. 24 hours, after first dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna, 24 hours after. Might be nothing to do with it, of course. But that was the temporal correlation. Three weeks after vaccination, developed blurred vision and confusion, again, bifronto headache, with photophobia, so fear of the light, the light was irritating her. Lumber function, re-route function revealed lots of lymphocytes, lymphocytosis. So lots of lymphocytes, as we saw on the pathologist slide, on that one, they were lymphocytes. They're around about the blood vessel. Two of the meninges. Of course, we would assume that sample was obtained afterwards. Broad spectromancer bio, antimicrobial cover was started, so just in case it was infection, gave lots of broad spectromancer biotics, didn't help. Her mental state actually worsened later that evening. I actually got worse. Left hemiparesis, so weakness down the left side of the body, indicating, of course, the right side of the brain was affected. One of the weird things is it's the, so the left side of the body's paralyzes the right side of the brain that's affected, which appears to be the situation in this woman's case. Elevated D dimer show that she had blood plots, that's a standard test. CSF, sobo spinal fluid culture and PCR testing returned negative, so it looks like there wasn't an active infection. This is an immunological reaction by the looks of it. There wasn't an active infection. Intercranial clasher remain refractory to maximum medical management. In other words, they just couldn't get it down. Refractory, the treatments were not working. They tried deep sedation, they tried paralysis, they tried hypothermia, none of it worked. Prompting a right, decompressive hemicrania, as we said, pretty drastic thing. I'm pretty sure that will mean removal of part of the bones on the side of the skull. The patient expired from refractory, cerebral edema. They could not treat the accumulation of fluid around the brain, in and around the brain. Brain autopsy showed infiltrates of lymphocytes, CD8 and CD4, so these are the T helper cells. They're the CD4 and these are other lymphocytes here, the CD8s. I think there is the cytotoxic cells. I think, anyway, the lymphocytes that shouldn't be there. An association with intravascular thrombi, so in the blood vessels, blood clots inside the vessels. Fungai and bacterial strains were negative, so they are limited to that form of infection. Diffuse, endothelial damage and vessel wall inflammation. Diffuse means all over the place. Endothelial, that's the lining of the blood vessels damage and vessel wall inflammation, so damage to the inside of the blood vessels and vessel wall inflammation. The lining and the walls of the vessels both with inflammatory changes. Suggesting an underlying pro-thombotic state and T cell inflammatory response, pro-thombotic state, more likely to get the blood clots. T cells inducing the inflammatory response by the looks of that. The arterial infact in this case is likely to be related to a pro-thombotic state, likely hood of making blood clots. Due to the large volume of infarction, it was a shoe chair of the brain affected as we saw. The patient was not started on anticoagulation after extensive discussion of the risks versus potential benefits. So in strokes, of course, in the early stages, you often give anticoagulants to increase the blood flow through the brain, but if a stroke is established, so if this part of the brain is blocked off from its blood supply, then that part of the brain will start to die, but of course the blood vessels will start to die as well because there's no blood supply going through the brain. So that means if you give anticoagulants, the blood could start flowing through damaged blood vessels and it would just leak out into the brain causing potentially catastrophic cerebral hemorrhage, which is why they decided again, spasumably, why they decided against anticoagulation. In summary, administration of COVID-19 vaccine was considered a possible cause, possible cause of the extensive multifocal arterial thombosis with associated inflammatory response and elevated intracranial pressure given the temporal association within 24 hours. The mechanism for initial elevation in intracranial pressure is not known but maybe related to cerebral auto-regulatory changes in the setting of cortical microvascular thombosis. In other words, what the saying is here, they don't know quite why the pressure inside the brain was high, the initial elevation in intracranial pressure, but maybe related to cerebral auto-regulatory changes. So normally there's an auto-regulation, the brain regulates its own blood supply and if the blood vessels were damaged, if there's changes in the settings of the cortical small blood vessels due to thombosis then the brain couldn't regulate its own blood supply, I think is all that means. So it looked like a bit of a downward spiral. Now just close with a few words from Dr. Peter McCullough from his substack which I put the link to there. Suspected un-expected serial adverse reactions such as this would have put a pause on the entire study and an investigation into why this happened and a call for risk mitigation measures to prevent the same complication from happening to more subjects had it been in the clinical trial. So are we prepared to put up with more adverse reactions now that these things are kind of been more widely released than we were in the clinical trials, seems a bit strange. The reason I find this so concerning is that the Moderna happens to Moderna, mRNA vaccines as plans to produce them on a huge scale. Oxford, Harwell, Science Park, new factory being built, I don't know what stage is that but I believe it's under construction now. Gonna make 250 million doses a year, same in Australia, a new plant, 100 million doses a year or more, Canada another plant to make another 100 million doses a year, Maryland of course in the States, different countries, the whole, the British government has signed a deal with Moderna to produce, as we say 250 million doses of these vaccines a year, we're committed to buying them as far as I understand it and yet these adverse reactions and of course you don't get a more serious adverse reaction than this one. In that one, I think this program should be paused until we know much much more than we know now, but unfortunately, corporate and governmental entities seem to be forging ahead. If the trials for these new mRNA vaccines that are coming out, I won't be volunteering. Big scale, little data, as far as I can see and a much of the data we do have is not what we'd like it to be. Check out the paper for yourself, all the links are there, full PDF freely available on that study. Thank you for watching."
Man with vaccine side-effect has message for unvaccinated,CNN,2021-10-22,qVcP3cI64ow,"You are, as you write, one of the unlucky ones who suffered, who was diagnosed with Guillemba race syndrome. And it's been a long road. How are you doing today? Well, I'm all right. I'm hanging in there. And it's been a bizarre experience. Normally, I'm a serial social media poster. But I held back and didn't tell my story. And this experience going through hospitals and rehab. But I decided to tell the story to try to get this more out in the open and be transparent about side effects. And just put all the cards on the table that this is possible. But it's very rare, exceedingly rare. And we take a lot more risks with a lot of other things that we do all the days of our lives. That is an important perspective. And also, it's quite a statement coming from someone who was one of the unlucky ones to be suffering from this. I want to read for everyone because Johnson and Johnson gave a statement to CNN today, which says, well, the risk of occurrence is very low. This does appear to be above background rates. We strongly support raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of rare events to ensure they can be quickly identified and effectively treated. And they talked to me about why you were reluctant to tell your story. Well, the conversation, what passes for a dialogue in the US has gotten awfully twisted around and supercharged. I was worried that telling my story, I would just exacerbate vaccine hesitation. The more I looked into it, most people I think who are hesitating or thinking about getting the vaccine are genuinely curious about it. They're concerned about side effects. They want to know how the vaccine works. And they're not so much believing these conspiracy theories. And you know, like how you could implanting a microchip or infertility, which are flat out not true. But this is an actual side effect. And I just thought it would be better to talk about it and be transparent about it. Although I understand why the public health establishment doesn't really talk about it much because it is so rare for it to happen. And for someone who is still hesitating, they might, again, as you have said, your concern is they might see this and think, wow, this could be me. So what do you want them to take from your experience? Because your message is, even if you look at me and what I've been through, you should still get vaccinated. Yes, I've really wrestled with it because this could easily freak people out, but you've got to come back and look at the numbers. And just how rare it is, it's 0.008 percent chance of getting Diannebury syndrome. And GBS is triggered by other things too, not just vaccines. I think it reflects a rise in autoimmune disorders. So talking about all of this and how our bodies work in the context of the vaccine, I think, is really important. And when people who are hesitating look at the chances, I think it's better to talk about the side effects rather than appear to be hiding something."
Post-vac syndrome: 'There is no such thing as a vaccine without side effects' | DW News,DW News,2023-06-12,uOxppT3gPpE,"Have you heard of the post-vaccine syndrome? It's a name some people in Germany are using for long-term side effects after a covered vaccination. Based on a few minor studies and observations, scientists estimate that the likelihood of severe side effects is low. Really low. Researchers speak of around 0.01 to 0.02 percent of all vaccinated people. That is quite a normal risk for any medicine or vaccine. Personally, I wanted to protect myself at least from the first time. But of course, others. Annette Herbert says she suffers from post-vaccine syndrome. I met her in Cologne, Germany. Annette was working as a medical assistant when she was vaccinated back in 2021. But right after the jab, she says this happened. Up until today, the feeling in her forefeet is mostly gone. She suffers from nerve pain, over stimulation and is exhausted quickly. Similar symptoms can occur in rare cases with other vaccines as well. But since many people were vaccinated at the same time during the COVID-19 pandemic, exceptional cases were more prominent. There is no such thing as an infection. So far, there is no evidence that the proportion of long-lasting symptoms after the COVID vaccinations is unusually high, according to the Paul Ehrlich institute, referring to an investigation of suspected cases from 36 countries. The Paul Ehrlich institute is the German Federal Institute for Vaccines, and the German Federal Institute for Vaccines, and the German Federal Institute for Vaccines, and Biomedical Medicinal Products. The problem, however, is that people like Annette, who may be suffering from adverse events after a COVID vaccination, felt neglected for a long time. Only slowly is the topic getting more attention. For her, it's clear that the jab is to blame. But with the exception of one doctor, she told me, no one would take her seriously. She wants to see the vaccine. But the question is, no one would take her seriously. I think some people have been treated as they are. Even this is always... No, I don't think so. That's why I didn't do anything to her, although it was very often. It's not a month later, but it's a direct matter. When I heard her story, I started researching and found more and more people that share similar experiences. There's yet no solid scientific proof of a relationship between the COVID-19 jab and the symptoms described. But experts say it's just a matter of time. For Annette, that's an unbearable situation. She found a safe space in her self-help group. Here, she can share her experiences with other affected people. Their symptoms vary, but they are united in rage and disappointment. And one more detail, everyone I talk to in the group, were initially positive about the COVID vaccine. You really have to be a specialist and then let it happen that you are actually trying to find it. So it's just a crown. We are not only affected by COVID-19, we were socially excluded, we are financially all shared here. We have lost our friends, because we were not believed at all. Let's remember, the pandemic was a highly political time in Germany and elsewhere. The atmosphere within society was charged. Anti-vexers took to the street claiming the jab makes you sick or even kills you. People questioning the side effects found themselves pitch and hold with anti-vexers. Now, research is starting slowly. Anette and the others want to see research afford step up. And that's the problem that the people who are not there or that it's a part that is also being denied. That's the problem. 70 percent of the world population got at least one COVID jab, meaning there could still be around half a million people affected. The lack of research and recognition puts them like anette, in a difficult position. That's my main critic on this whole idea, because the patients are there now, but that you can still stay in the ring and let them back. They don't have to be bad, they can't be bad. Some people who say they have post-vex syndrome and now suing vaccine manufacturers like Biontech and Pfizer for compensation. But we are not sure if they are going to be able to do that. They are not going to be able to do that. But now what seems to be needed is research, research, and more research."
Second COVID Vaccine Shot Side Effects,SciShow,2021-02-12,nucCr7Sywgc,"This episode was filmed on February 9, 2021. If we have any updates about COVID-19 vaccinations or the pandemic in general, they will be in the playlist linked in the description. With the COVID-19 vaccines finally getting into people's arms, you might have heard that your second dose might feel a little rougher than the first, and it's true. Participants in clinical trials, plus the recently vaccinated public, saw more frequent and more intense side effects on their second jab than their first. This is actually a sign that the vaccines are working properly, so while you should prepare to feel maybe a little crummy for a couple days, it's a good thing overall. And it might hint at the possibility of more good news that people who've recovered from COVID-19 could only need one shot. The key thing to understand is that these reactions to vaccines, things like fever, chills, and other side effects, aren't really from the vaccine itself. Their natural byproducts of your immune system learning to fight the germ the vaccine is teaching it to spot. And that response is stronger after the second shot, because the first shot did what it was supposed to do. To understand what I mean, let's have a quick refresher on how vaccines work. In general, vaccines teach your immune system to spot a pathogen by giving it some harmless version or just a part of it to study. That way, if it ever encounters the real deal, it'll be ready to fight it. We call this adaptive immunity, but it does not happen immediately. It takes weeks to fully develop the strong, targeted response that vaccines are aiming for. So the first time a vaccine introduces your immune system to a new pathogen, any discomfort you feel is something else. Your innate immunity kicking in. This is a generalized first line of defense that attacks anything the body perceives as a threat. And it definitely can have some uncomfortable side effects. For instance, within a few hours, you can have local reactions, which are things like pain and redness at the injection site, or tenderness in the armpit of the arm that received the injection. You can also have systemic reactions that point to a more widespread activation of your immune system. These are symptoms like fatigue, headache, and all-over muscle pain. But often these side effects are minor, or maybe not noticeable at all. What matters is what's happening in the background. While your innate immunity is doing its thing, the immune cells that do the heavy lifting in adaptive immunity are studying the foreign materials and building up targeted weapons like antibodies. That way, by the time you get your second dose of the vaccine, your adaptive immunity has the tools it needs to fight the invader. And it does. That too can set off local and systemic reactions. So following your second shot, you get both innate and adaptive immunity acting at once, which is why the side effects are often more severe. This strong dual immune reaction also ensures your body takes the threat seriously and ramps up its defenses against it even more. So as much as we dislike the potential side effects, the result is lasting protection from the virus. Now, some people get this short into the stick here. Thanks to their unique experiences and genetic makeup, they really feel it when their immune system gets riled up, while others don't. And we don't totally know why. But if you're going to feel crummy, the odds are higher it'll happen in dose number two. And that's not news. That's exactly what was seen in the clinical trials for these vaccines. For example, across all age groups in the Moderna trial, more participants reported some kind of local or systemic reaction on their second dose of the vaccine. And something similar was seen with the Biontech vaccine now being distributed by Pfizer. While pain at the injection site was more common after the first dose, the researchers noted more redness and swelling after the second dose, as well as more body-wide reactions like fatigue, fever, and muscle pain. Thankfully, in trials, these effects almost always went away after two or three days. There's also nothing really special about the side effects occurring now. You're hearing about them because lots of people are getting vaccinated all at once, and this is a really big deal and everybody's talking about it. But these side effects are on par with what's seen in other multi-dose vaccinations given to adults. Take shingricks, for example. A shingles vaccine you might get if you're over 50 years old. Most people get a sore arm while some feel fatigue, headaches, or muscle pain that lasts a couple days. That said, some people who've already had COVID-19 are reporting something different. They seem to be having those stronger second dose side effects after dose one. And that maybe because the disease itself can act kind of like a first vaccine dose in that it teaches the immune system to spot the virus. So the first dose of the vaccine may be having similar effects to everyone else's booster. What's nifty about that is that it could mean that they only need one dose. To be clear, the vast majority of clinical trials for these vaccines have only used a two-dose vaccination strategy, so no one has tested this one vaccine hypothesis. But two recent preprint articles concluded that we might be able to reallocate the limited doses of the mRNA vaccines being distributed by Pfizer and Moderna without compromising safety. One found that people who had recovered from COVID-19 developed at least 10 times as many antibodies after one dose of an mRNA vaccine as previously healthy people who got two. And the other found that healthcare workers who had previously had COVID-19 had antibody levels on par with folks who got two doses of the mRNA vaccines but had never been infected. That might mean that previously infected individuals might only need one shot to protect. And if that's the case, we may be able to give that second vaccine dose to someone else, and hopefully get people vaccinated even faster. Now we do these studies only had a few hundred participants and neither has been peer reviewed, so we can't start making sweeping statements yet. And there are no changes in policy or anything, so in the meantime, keep doing what your medical professionals tell you to do. Still, if you've had COVID-19 be warned, your first vaccine shot could be the rough one. And for everyone else, it might be helpful to set your expectations ahead of time. Yes, there's a good chance you'll feel bad after the second dose in particular, and need to take a day or two to rest and recuperate. But it'll be worth it because these expected temporary side effects are way less intense and debilitating than getting a bad case of COVID-19, and we all just want to get through this pandemic so we can relax a little bit.

AstraZeneca withdrawn worldwide over side effects,Sky News Australia,2024-05-07,v0uzpwN3cQ4,The AstraZeneca COVID vaccine is being withdrawn worldwide after the pharmaceutical giant admitted it causes a rare and dangerous side effect. AstraZeneca admitted the claims in court documents lodged in February. Parent company Vaxevria has come under intense scrutiny in recent months over a rare side effect which causes blood clots and low blood platelet counts. AstraZeneca told the court that it can in very rare cases cause clots in the kidney.
Serious adverse events,Dr. John Campbell,2023-09-11,vsh5xNjc1Fs,"Well, welcome to this talk and I really want to welcome Dr. Joseph Freeman all the way from Louisiana. So Dr. Freeman is an emergency physician and also an author. Dr. Freeman, welcome and thank you so much for coming on. Oh, it's my pleasure to be here. So you have a busy doctor, you're an emergency physician in Louisiana working in different areas, you work shifts and somehow you've found time to do this excellent reanalysis of the original publications of the safety data from the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines. What stimulated you to look into this and to do this reanalysis in the first place? Well, initially we, you know, I was, prior to COVID also, I was doing research and then with COVID coming on, of course, that became the topic, everything else got thrown to the wayside. And when the vaccine was released initially, I had gone over the full FDA briefing for both Pfizer and Moderna, published in a physician website, basically a summary of what they had discussed in the large briefing. And initially I didn't have any specific safety concerns based off of that data. It was more I had some general concern for a novel, a novel platform that had never, that had limited safety testing, but it was very non-specific of what, what harms there could be, just that the knowledge that sometimes we've learned about harms frequently, we learned about harms with time that we've had from when we approve a drug and that's for drugs that have gone through, you know, many years of, of safety data testing. It was just the general concern that I had. Then in April, April 2020, which is about four or five months after the vaccine was authorized, came this two large studies that together sort of confirmed that the spike protein was, was toxic and that it was causing all the, all these weird things that we've been learning about for the last year, year and a half, I guess, at that point, about what COVID can cause, all these strange things, heart attacks, strokes, diarrhea, you know, the stomach issues, all sorts of different issues. And I was sort of shocked by that finding because we'd made a vaccine that makes our body produce spike protein. And that is, was really bad luck in my mind. If we had known that the spike protein was toxic when they were building this vaccine, I doubt they would have used that as the go-to protein. So that was my initial concern. Then the follow-up concern was the public response to this discovery, which was saying things such as, oh, the spike protein in the vaccine is different than the spike protein in the virus. And my thought was, well, that's not good either because if it's different, then it won't work. It has to be the same. That's how this whole thing sort of works. And then there's this idea that it just stays in your arm and at the time there wasn't good biode distribution data. And in general, as a physician, I mean, if you inject something into an arm, it's pretty unusual for it to stay in the arm. And we're just boosting it over and over. Is that all just staying in your right bicep? Just keeps getting bigger and bigger from the amount of injections? It didn't make sense. We later learned there was biode distribution. And then at the same time, there was also a CDC myth website where I would say that saying that the COVID vaccine, the spike protein that the vaccine produces is toxic, is a myth. So I felt like the response to learning that the spike protein was toxic should have been a moment like, put your seats up, the plane. You're coming in for a crash landing. This is a problem. We need to figure this out really quickly. But instead, it seemed like it was just dismissed. So initially, I put together this idea of a study to look, to create a list of spike protein harms and see if the vaccine is inducing spike protein harms in the trial. This is given it was called a myth by the CDC at the time. We felt that it was not going to be looked kindly upon to have a spike protein list. And so, but we found this group called the Brighton Collaboration. Yeah. That had a list of adverse events of special interest. And the list included, we'd created an actual list for the COVID spike protein. And it was, most of them were contained within this AEI, AESI list. And it's because of how they created it. They look at all the things that COVID had been responsible for. In addition to that, they are looking for possible harms of the lipid nanoparticle and just what we'd expect from various other vaccines in the past. They created a list of things that are potentially caused by the vaccine. We don't know they are. It's done before the clinical trial. They're supposed to be used within the clinical trial to look for if this vaccine is causing harm. And so, we took that list. It's endorsed by the WHO to reanalyze these clinical trials to examine for the possibility that they could be causing harm. So AESI adverse events of special interest. And who actually are the Brighton Collaboration? Who are the individuals involved here? And where did they get the authority from? They've been creating these adverse events of special interest for some period of time. And they're essentially experts in vaccinology. They have a pretty good track record for identifying harms of vaccines prior to the clinical trials. And they've been pretty reliable. Why the WHO has endorsed them for using that list for evaluating vaccines? Yes, an established group of experts, isn't it? Now, you conducted a secondary analysis on the original trials that were conducted by Pfizer and Moderna. These phase three randomized clinical trials in adults. And these, of course, were famously, infamously both published in that definitive text, the New England Journal of Medicine. Can you tell us just roughly what sort of trials were done? What is a placebo control phase three trial? And what is a secondary analysis? Was there something wrong with the primary analysis or something? Oh, so a clinical, when a double blind randomized trial, you compare a medical intervention and then you have versus a placebo group where everyone's supposed to be blinded and not know. Ideally, if you know, for the FDA, they advise that they should be designed to have the outcome be clinically meaningful. And while they're doing it, they're also looking at various other things. So there's lots of data that they produce. And a secondary analysis takes that data and applies a different question or applies it in a slightly different way to see if the results would be the same as the initial trial. And so there, it's a common practice that's been done for clinical trials for as long as I know of. So that's the general idea of it. Yeah. Now, you identified excess risk in the vaccinated group as opposed to the non-vaccinated group in terms of adverse events, adverse events of special interest. What do we mean by excess risk? Surely there's a risk with anything. Oh, excess risk means, so we're looking at serious adverse events in our, that was our specific analysis. Serious adverse events are defined by Pfizer and Moderna, very much the same. It leads to death or life threatening, it's hospitalization, permanent disability. These things are serious and it's their definition serious, but they are, they are all serious things that you wouldn't want to happen to you. So when you look at the clinical trial, when you look at the, we just simply collect that data from the on serious adverse events, we count them, we pull them all from the data set. And then we have the list, we count them basically in both of the charts and then essentially we do our, the secondary analysis of it, which would be the AESI list of looking at, which ones would fit, of those serious ones would fit into this AESI category. And what I mean by, what we mean by excess risk is, is there, so you'd expect serious adverse events, for example, heart attacks. They're just going to happen. There's study has 40,000 people. Do more happen in the vaccine group is what an excess risk is because both groups will have heart attacks no matter what, but are there more heart attacks? Are there more strokes? Are there more, you know, is there more anything that is a serious adverse event in the vaccine group is what an excess risk would be? I mean, I do find it a pity that this wasn't done and presented in the original papers in the New England Journal of Medicine. It's a pity that independent academics such as you had to do this. Were you asked to do this by the pharmaceutical industry or were you funded or sponsored in any way to do this? No, no. There's no funding at all. This is all, every clinical, there are seven of us on seven scientists working on this. No one was, no one was paid in a single dime. It was all done with our free, with our free time. So. And it's just moving the, the, the experts such as yourself do take the time to do this for the benefit of all of us. So we certainly appreciate what you've done. What while being sad that it is necessary for people like you to do this. It's a great thing to do. So if you went into science, you know, there's, you know, that's, it's a calling to, to, to do science. So, so, you know, finding people, this, it wasn't a problem finding there were people who were concerned and interested in this project and, and they all volunteered and I, that part doesn't really surprise me that, that there are people volunteering, especially with the concerns that I was raising before that there felt to be a lack of an investigation. So there was people felt the need to put their, you know, skills that they've trained with their whole life to, to the, for the benefit of, of everyone else. Yeah. No, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's still a noble thing to do is it's a great thing to do. Go, go, going on to the results, results, Joseph, um, fires a vaccine excess risk of serious adverse events. So this is how much more likely there was to be a serious adverse event of special interest in the vaccine group versus the placebo group. Now, it's 10.1 per 10,000 excess adverse events. Higher than the placebo baseline, where it was 17.6. So it's, it's 10.1 higher. Now, I've kind of just done a simple sum. I'm not a statistician really, but, uh, you know, 10.1 for 10,000. Is it fair to say this transposes into one serious adverse event, per 990 vaccinations with the Pfizer? Um, yeah, that is a, um, definitely about the estimate of what that would be. Uh, I think it's for all of these increases in excess, excess risk. Uh, I think it's best to almost think of the, that one in 900 that year that you're saying there, it's, these are estimates. And it's, if you did the trial again, it would be slightly different. So it's the, there's a range of possibilities. It could be, it could be one in 800. It could be one in a thousand in there. But, uh, and that's for adverse events, a special interest. The thing that was actually the most shocking finding of our, of our entire study to me, and I think to the rest of my team was, uh, when we just calculated, when we just added up all the serious adverse events in the trial, there was a higher incidence of, of serious adverse events, not adverse events, the special interest just, they didn't have to do any analysis. They just needed to count. They just counted the number of events in both groups. In the Pfizer trial, you see that there is an increase of about 18 in 10,000 and, uh, relative risk, or risk ratio of 1.36. Yeah. And so that's a 36 percent increase. Our confidence intervals are, are all above one, which, you know, suggests with the 95 percent arbitrary, like the threshold of this 95 percent that we use. And it means that in the Pfizer trial, the, the people in the vaccine group were more likely. There was a more serious adverse events in the vaccine group than there were in the placebo group. And, uh, I, the reason that that was missed is, uh, because they, the surprising thing is, if you read the New England Journal, it says that the incidence of serious adverse events in both groups was similar. I believe that's the term they use was similar or they say, or they say balanced. But that's a very strange way to describe something that's higher in the vaccine group. And, uh, it's a very strange way to describe it indeed. Yeah. So we actually wrote the New England Journal about that and asked them to, to correct this because the, the term, they say the incidence of serious adverse events is balanced or similar. And, uh, we asked them to change it to say that it's higher in the vaccine group because that's the reason. It's from your reanalysis. Oh, it's, it's, this one's not even a reanalysis as much as just counting the counting. Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's not much, we just count, we just did the math for them that was there. It's not, yeah, not much reanalysis needs to happen. Uh, and, and, you know, it's, I believe that the reason they maybe stated it as such was because they were, it's an error in that they were trying to say the incidence of participants who experienced a serious adverse event is similar because if you look at the way you can measure these things are, we just counted the number of events. They counted the number of participants who experienced one. And, um, so there's, you know, a 27 percent increase in the number of participants who experienced one, but it's, it's, it, you know, it's confidence interval, which, you know, would be the statistically significant term. It, it wouldn't cross it. It would be, you know, it would cross, it would cross that confidence interval. So maybe that's why they felt they can say it, but it's either way it's stated incorrectly in the New England Journal as, as of today. You're a very generous man. I can see that in your, the way you evaluate that. The, the, the Moderna vaccines risk of side serious adverse events, 15.1 per 10,000. And, and that works out at, uh, one per 662 vaccine doses given. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Combining the, combining the two, it works out at 12.5 per 100,000. So basically one chance in 800 of a serious adverse event. Um, is this sort of risk commonplace in medicine? Is it, you take these risks on a daily basis as you prescribe for your patients or would you think, or just a minute? Well, it depends on the, on the drug. Uh, so, you know, for a chemotherapy, I would imagine the rate for serious adverse events is much, much higher than that. But for a vaccine, uh, that, at least the CDC reports that the rate for most vaccines is about one to two per million. So this is a, a, a multi-fold difference in, in serious adverse event rate. Wow. So we've gone from one to two per million to one to 800, which, a quick sum in my head, is like 1200 times more common. Yeah, it's definitely, it's, it is way worse. It's, it's definitely a lot more. Yeah. It's like a thousand times worse. It's, by, by those criteria. Yeah. Yes, it is. Wow. If you want to do the math, yeah, but thousand times worse. Yeah. Yeah. So you're also gave a reanalysis you said in terms of, um, risk ratio. Just briefly, what, what is risk ratio, please? Uh, it's essentially a, a relative risk how you would report relative risk. So for the way you'd interpret that would be one point it's, if you're in the vaccine group for the, uh, with the Pfizer vaccine or we could do the combined one, which was, uh, I'll top my head at what was it? One point six. The five is 1.36. 1.36, yes. Okay. But the Moderna's 1.06 and the combined is 1.16. So combined, it's 16 percent more likely to have an adverse. Yes, so. Yeah. 16 percent more likely, yes. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. 1.36 times 1.16, yes. The way you interpret a relative risk is you take that number and you say it's 1.16 times the risk of, you know, it's 1. Yeah. Yeah. But it's still a fact to say that the combined figure is a 16 percent higher risk of getting another sort of. It did. And there's reason to believe that the within the Moderna trial that there's, we are concerned that there are serious adverse events that are hidden within it in the, mostly in the placebo group that were from COVID-19 caused by COVID-19. And typically for a safety analysis, you are supposed to remove the efficacy outcome or you create a, what's called an all cause outcome. I can all cause hospitalization. And it's not that all cause outcomes are, aren't useful. They are useful. But when you're doing a safety analysis, you just want to look at the harms and not, so you are supposed to remove efficacy. COVID-19 being an efficacy outcome. Fiser did remove that and Moderna did not. We attempted to remove those COVID-19 cases from Moderna. However, the problem is that with COVID-19 serious outcomes, you could end up with multiple serious adverse events from COVID-19 that would be still littered within there that we wouldn't be able, we weren't able to identify because we didn't have the, we didn't have the data to identify it. Yeah. To identify it. So when the Moderna data is showing 6 percent greater risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group and the Pfizer is showing 36 percent, that's comparing apples with oranges then. It's a different methodology of collecting the data. It is. And we've, we've been speaking with the FDA and also with Moderna. First, first, with, you know, Moderna to try to get this data so that we can actually look at it with that efficacy outcome removed and also ask the FDA why they allowed Moderna to run their safety analysis in such a, in such a manner differently from the Pfizer because I would, and without any mention that it was run differently. They should have at least mentioned that it was different. I'm not sure if it was unnoticed or I'm not 100 percent sure why Pfizer and Moderna analyze their safety data slightly differently. Well, for the amount of money and amount of expertise at the FDA, it's quite an oversight. Yeah, I would have thought they were, they were, they were quite rushed and it's the kind of thing that if it took us several months to identify that, that issue. So they had to approve this in just a month or two. So it wouldn't surprise me if it just didn't get identified because of the, you know, how quickly the vaccine was, was authorized. Yeah, but it's their full-time job and it was your part-time job. So a new picked it up and they didn't as the point. So fair. Yeah. So you suggest a formal harm benefit analysis. What is a harm benefit analysis and why are you suggesting that this is done? Oh, so a harm benefit analysis simply as you, you try to take the harms that are, you know, that of any interventions causing, you look at the benefits and then you compare them. An issue, there's lots of issues always with harm benefit analysis and because, you know, for a drug that prevents heart attacks, for example, right? It just so turns out usually that whatever harms that, that drug causes, it's probably not increasing heart attacks too. So you can't just compare heart attacks and heart attacks because that would, that's just the benefit. And so then there becomes a lot of subjectivity in terms of how do you compare? And there's been lots of different methodologies to do it. One way would have been great if the vaccine trial had this would have just been to look at all cause hospitalizations who got hospitalized, who got hospitalized the least, which group. Obviously. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, for Paxlevid, Pfizer's Paxlevid trial, that was actually their primary out was all cause hospitalization. In the vaccine trial, they actually still, we still don't know the all cause hospitalization rate from that trial. It's never been made public. So that would be one way that would be useful if we could just get that data released. That would be useful to understand if the vaccine were hospitalized way less than the vaccine group. Oh, that's, you know, if the, you know, that's great if the vaccine was reducing all cause hospitalizations, it's working. But if the vaccine group has, has higher rates of hospitalization, then that would be pretty concerning. Or if it's, or if it's just too small of a trial to identify it and it's a no result, that would, that would not be useful either way. But either, either way, we should have, I think the data should be public. Well, we've got reason to believe that Pfizer and Moderna will be watching this video. So as soon as they hear this, no doubt the data will be in the post to you and you can carry out that. I would hope. I would hope, I would hope. But for the harm benefit analysis that, that we did, we, we took the adverse events of special interest. Yep. And we compare the, the access risk that we were identifying cause these are all things that are considered serious life threatening, life threatening hospitalization, permanent disability. I presume that the large majority of them were due to hospitalization. Then we compared it to COVID-19 hospitalizations and, and you know, people critique like these are not the same because some of the hospitalizations for one thing won't be as serious as a COVID-19 hospitalization. But in reality, there's some minor COVID hospitalizations. So in fact, probably the majority are and then there's some ICU level intubations. People intubated in the ICU and the same would be true for the serious adverse events. So some people had a stroke and that's pretty devastating. Some people just had, you know, diarrhea that was so severe they needed to come in the hospital to get IV to prevent them from dying from dehydration. And they probably walk out without much. But in that harm benefit analysis, what we identified from within the trial is that the rate of serious adverse events, the excess risk in for special of special interest group, are higher than the reduction in in a COVID-19 hospitalization. So within the trial, it looks like you were more likely to have an adverse event of special interest in the vaccine group than you were to have a COVID-19 hospitalization reduced. Now when I talk about that, that harm benefit analysis is important to understand their limitations to how we can interpret it, I think. And it's important to mention those because, you know, let's say the trial had gone on for six months. Maybe then that we would have seen the hospitalization reduction increase. Maybe there was a COVID-19 surge, the hospitalization rate would have been, and it would have balanced it out the other way or maybe if they just did older people, maybe older nursing home patients, maybe the hospitalization reduction would have been increased for, you know, and it would have tilted it towards the vaccine being beneficial. However, had the trial been done in younger or healthier patients with less hospitalizations to reduce or during Omicron when there's less hospitalizations to reduce or Omicron where the vaccine is known to be less effective. And in that situation, you would actually the harm benefit analysis would tilt in the other direction towards more harm to benefit. And I think that when you consider that, you know, there's different ways that this can go. I think that the harm benefit analysis we put forward simply demonstrates the fragility of this harm to benefit ratio and how just the slightest, you know, differences can alter it in one way or the other. And that in itself should be concerning. The odd patient being excluded could make a huge difference to the overall data. So to adjudicate whether the risk benefit analysis is affecting a particular age group, or particular sex, you would need to have that information. You would need this participant level data. Has that now been released? No, no, the participant level data, which means knowing the serious adverse event that was that each person had their age, their sex, any sort of demographic information we have on them. No, we don't have that that hasn't been made public. We've actually asked, we sent a letter to an open letter to the CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna. It was published in the BMJ asking for this data. It's would be necessary for us to help us to do some subgroup analysis. Because, you know, maybe these adverse events are happening in that elderly at risk group. And maybe the benefits are outweighing the harm in that specific group. Maybe if they're spread throughout, then maybe a problematic in the younger people. But, you know, it's difficult. We can't make much of any sort of subgroup analysis without that patient level data. And that's why it would be important to make it public. And yet, the drug companies have this data. They just don't release that data to independent researchers, such as yourself. Yes, the drug companies and the FDA have it. I believe for some reason the European EMA does not have it. They do not have it. We had asked them for it as well. They have to put in a special request for it, they said to us. But, yeah, FDA has it as well. And they also have not released it to the public. Well, FDA, if you're watching, get Dr. Fryman this data ASAP, please. So we can analyze it. Then we'll all know. Because that might mean that a particular intervention is less appropriate in a particular age group. Unless we have the age group data, we don't know. Or it could mean it's appropriate for everyone. We don't know. Maybe it's great. I mean, I don't know exactly what the data will show. It's, I don't know, we don't have it. We'd have to figure out what it, you know, we'd have to determine what it shows after we obtain it. I don't like the secrecy, but there you go. That's what we have. Now, now the results of the initial trial were to do with the likelihood of getting infected with the virus. And they express this in terms of a relative risk, vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Do you think it would have been a good idea of the given some indication to absolute risk as well as relative risk? And could you maybe just sort of pick those two apart a little bit before? First, it was a reduction in symptomatic infection. Not infection. Like COVID-19, cold-like symptoms, essentially, with a positive test. They didn't do just weekly testing, which would have been a superior, in my opinion, a superior way of judging efficacy. It wasn't reduction in hospitalization, which also I think would have been a better way of running that trial. It was symptomatic infection, which has some subjectivity in it. But the relative risk versus absolute risk, a distinction there is a, you know, they said 95 percent reduction in symptomatic infection. It was relative to the placebo group. So I think in the vaccine, and you know, it was about, for Pfizer, I think it was like 162 versus seven. I might have my numbers slightly off there, but it's about that. So the relative risk was 95 percent less. Now, an absolute risk would have been looking at, okay, what was the risk of infection in the placebo group and the vaccine group? And so there were 20,000 or so people in each group. So it was, you know, point something percent versus a smaller point. It was a decimal. It was a fraction of a percent of the infection that it prevented. And that, you know, when you talk about it as absolute risk, this is a long held debate within, you know, very, very nerdy confines of medical statistics and medical communication. But it, the reality is both relative risk and absolute risk have value. They should both be discussed to get a better understanding of what you're dealing with. I think with the COVID vaccine, there was maybe a reasonableness to talk about the relative risk to emphasize it more because I think at the time they believed that this vaccine would be too and done and that we would have the vaccine efficacy for the rest of our lives, like most other vaccines. And so if you say 95 percent effective, it's said that actually is a better way of determining that if they were correct with their hope, if their hope was correct, that the vaccine would just last for, you know, for 20, 30 years, then you'd say, oh, that, look, over the next 20, 30 years, you get this 95 percent benefit, which, you know, you don't do a trial for 20, 30 years. However, like, for example, if the trial had gone on for two to three years, and I think that absolute risk then wouldn't be that would be, I worry that with two months it could be a little misleading if the vaccine would be way below one percent efficacy. Yeah, but let's say a trial of two years, it could have been higher. Yes, exactly. I think a great thought experiment hypothetical is if the trial had gone on for two to three years, and we were looking at all cause hospitalization, the point that they still haven't released yet. Now, it looks to me that the vaccine does increase some hospitalizations likely from, as we see in our study, at least for certain, it looks like that in the Pfizer trial. Now, if we looked at that over a two to three year period and presuming that the vaccinated group would get boosters whenever the CDC decided it was a good idea for them to get them, because, or maybe they could have actually, let's say they even figured out the correct timing for boosters with trial data. That would have been useful. But imagine such a trial was done and then it was done perfectly over two to three years. Would there be a reduction in all cause hospitalization? Because that's the question that actually people want to know the answer to, is if I take this vaccine and I take it how I'm supposed to, do I go to the hospital less? Sure. We're going to hospital more. And two to three years, I believe that the problem with that is, well, first off, is that we don't know the answer. And I don't think anyone can be certain on the answer to that, especially given that we know the massive rapid waning of these of the vaccines. And then you compare that with the fact that people post infection have prolonged, prolonged immunity much longer than the vaccine. Then Omicron comes in and the vaccine has reduced immunity. We really, once we had this whole infection, it's not reducing infection anymore. It's just reducing hospitalization and death, which was based off of observational data, which is not a good way to determine the efficacy of a drug. And we've, that has gotten us into complete mistakes so many times in the past. So if that trial had been done, the big thing is we don't know the answer. And it would have been useful. I wish it had been done. So that we have the answer, we would know that we're giving someone medication that is to their benefit. That would be, that would be great. So the initial trial was preventing symptomatic infection. Then you could say that the goal posts were moved to say prevented hospitalization, but we don't have the all-course hospitalization data. So, well, also, the thing that concerns me about this is if you look at the infection mortality rate, I guess you can say, or infection hospitalization rate in the clinical trial, in the vaccinated group, their infection mortality rate and their infection hospitalization rate is not lower. It's not lower than the placebo group. It looks to me, like in the clinical trial, that the way that the vaccine reduced hospitalization and, well, didn't, we didn't see death in mortality improvement, but the way it reduced hospitalization was probably by preventing infection initially. So if it stops preventing against infection, I don't, biologically, I just don't see how it then gained a special ability that it didn't have in the clinical trial to reduce hospitalization. And I would be concerned that in an observational study, looking at hospitalization that you'd result in something called a, you could have something called a healthy user bias, where, you know, as was shown in, and even to be occurring with the COVID vaccine, in a New England journal, response from Veney Prasad and Tracy Beth Hogue, where they were showing that this healthy vaccine user bias could account for the entire entirety possibly of the benefit. So that's people who are healthier anyway elected to be vaccinated, as an earlier stage. Sort of, sort of, it's healthier people elected too, but also people who are in hospice who are about to die, don't really get it, or if you're in the ICU right now, you wouldn't necessarily get it. So you see a strong healthy user bias, especially probably in the first six months after a vaccine is going to be distributed, and then it's going to decreases with time, which is sort of exactly how this hospitalization benefit appears to be occurring. And I don't know if it's, you know, it's possible that the vaccine that has, is having great hospitalization benefits that, but we don't know how to, how to adjust for this healthy vaccine user bias. So I would be, I think people should be concerned that we are unaware, we're uncertain if, if the vaccine is reducing hospitalization and death, in the manner that it's being, I think, I feel it's sort of being reported in that this, with this certainty, this level of confidence, of we know, we know it's doing this. And we don't usually speak like that, or shouldn't speak like that in the medical community about the efficacy of any medical intervention that we're basing it on observational data. We just, we just keep getting that wrong. Oh, we've gotten it over and over again, wrong, and often those interventions, when we get it wrong, when we look at it, we find out it's doing the exact opposite. It's harming people when we were, you know, for hormone replacement therapy being one of the most famous examples, we thought it was reducing heart attack strokes and breast cancer, did a randomized trial. Whoops, it was increasing heart attack strokes and breast cancer. Yeah, so it, so medical history is useful for knowing how to interpret it. We need to learn from history, that is for sure. Yeah. Yeah. You're very honest in your paper about the limitations, limitations to the follow-up time, but that wasn't your fault. That was the way the studies were done. Serious adverse events, who, who adjudicated what was a serious adverse events? It seemed to be mostly the regulators. You didn't have the raw clinical deity, you didn't have the blood results, so you could adjudicate yourself. You just had to take the regulators word for what was a serious adverse event. Yeah, it was regulators, but I actually don't, I believe that it was actually the clinicians on site who were working with, you know, the companies hired by Pfizer and Moderna, it would be the ones who would, would educate them, but they were supposed to have been blinded to these results. So they shouldn't have known if they were in the vaccine, or it's possible that there was some unblinding and they may have may have known a little bit, but it turns out that the participants had a pretty good idea. It seems like which group they were in based on some side effects. Yeah, and of course, what is a serious, you know, what is a serious event is subjective to the individual? Is that old joke in medicine that a minor procedure is any procedure carried out on someone else? It's easy to say it's minor when it's someone else rather than yourself. Yeah, this is not that. A person thinking that a serious, an adverse event that occurred to them was serious is not relevant to what we, it's called a serious adverse event. It has to be called a serious adverse event by a clinician. Got it. So it's, but yes, you're correct in that, and that people will, people have things that are serious to them that wouldn't make it into this, into this grouping. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we've already talked about the lack of participant level data, the difficulty with full transparency and the lack of detailed clinical data. So all those things that were limitations for the study, I think we're completely out of your control. Yes, how long the study was that is one of the critiques of our harm benefit analysis. There was, you know, you would see someone who has a blog or such a, or tweeting that you can't possibly do a harm benefit analysis based on two months of data. I would, I'm concerned if they believe that, then why would you authorize the population to take a drug if you can't do a proper harm benefit analysis that seems so I suggest, I mean, I don't know if that individual thinks that the trial was too short to have been authorized and we should have waited for more data before authorizing, but that was their critique of our harm, that is a common critique of our harm benefit analysis. Yeah. Just as a clinician, as a clinician, Joseph, he's seeing many patients admitted with COVID now in your sort of day-to-day practice. No, back, you know, in the first couple of surges, it was my entire ICU was, we're filled with people very sick with COVID-19, the classical syndrome of COVID-19. I was responding to two to three of these rapid responses a day when I work at night, I'm the only physician in the hospital. So after any time, something goes wrong. So I have a very good finger on the pulse of what's going on in terms of, you know, people getting real sick, people dying. I have to pronounce every one of them. And first couple of surges, every, I would see two to three, a shift, and typically it would be two, it would be, you know, one every, one every three or four shifts. This is a massive, massive increase in, you know, death and devastation, I guess. But since the Omicron variant, the interesting thing was prior also, I'd watch the news, increase in infections, walk into work, if that had been a couple days off. Oh, yeah, infections are increasing. I'd see it. Hospitalizations increasing. Oh, yeah, that's true. Hospitalizations are increasing. That's are increasing. Yep, it was like, it was like the weather. It's like when you walk out of your house, you look at your phone, oh, 70 degrees. Oh, that does feel like 70. You know, I can't say that the numbers are 100 percent accurate, but the direction, the, you saw things increasing and decreasing. And now, during Omicron, when they said infections are increasing, that was true. Then they said hospitalizations were increasing. Not, I didn't see hospitalizations from Omicron increasing. I saw people being admitted who just randomly had COVID-19, who maybe had a psychosis episode or they had missed their dialysis. And, but I think that our system had a little bit of trouble distinguishing between, you know, people who were being admitted for totally random things and have COVID-19. This is people with COVID-19 as opposed to that. Yeah, four COVID-19. And I don't think that was a serious problem in 2020 or through much of 2021. And until the end of 2021, but by February 2022, I would say that they were by far the majority of COVID-19 hospitalizations. In fact, for me, since February of 2022, I have not admitted a single COVID-19 patient. So that's about a year and a half since I have admitted one. And when I speak to my colleagues about this, that's quite similar for them. Maybe one report, a couple of handful would report, oh, I have admitted one, you know, I admitted one, two or three months ago. I don't know what alley this man must have crawled down to get this old COVID. But it's quite clear to the clinicians who are treating this, that the disease has fundamentally changed with Omicron. It's not causing hospitalizations at the same rate. And this is not just my own personal experience. There's a study I believe at a Denmark that was showing that something about 75 percent of their COVID-19 deaths were not related to COVID-19. There's a talk from the CEO of some Los Angeles hospital who saying that they were saying that 90 percent of their patients in the ICU who are COVID-19 positive are not there for COVID-19. There has been some, besides that publish article and this CEO's talk, there has been some mention of it, but it's it isn't, it hasn't been that publicly discussed. I feel like there's still a great fear that the disease is causing hospitalizations at these great rates. But I personally, I don't see that and I don't know anyone who, any clinician who has been seeing that. So you're not saying the site to kind storms, you're not seeing the soggy lungs with acute respiratory distress syndrome, you're not seeing the ground glass opacity, but you are seeing people who have got coma riddages being admitted with those coma riddages. But not for COVID-19. Yeah. For, you know, they had something else that happened to them. Could it be that, I mean, you would need to do a lot more research, but it could it be that COVID-19 is increasing these other things as we know the old one did and maybe that's, but it's not it's not the classical syndrome like we were seeing before. And that's another concern right now for the COVID vaccine of talking about for boosters and such, because if we're saying it's not stopping infection, even the claim that I questioned if that's even true, if it's only purpose is stopping hospitalizations death. No, it's not. If it's not causing hospitalizations, then I I am curious to know then what benefit it would offer. If it's not, you know, if it's if that's the if that's the case. So I still don't know actually and I would I would like to see a trial that that demonstrated that that, you know, the COVID vaccine boosters are reducing hospitalization and death as we, you know, as is publicly said by much of our many of our governments. Yeah, we're being protected again something that's essentially no risk at all and even then we're not really being protected and we've got the adverse events. It's a very bizarre situation we seem to be in at the moment. Yes, there's briefly Joseph just to just to finish you don't mind the FDA you've done an update release about the FDA's thinking on this. Now that they're using Neil near real-time surveillance or so the claim for vaccine safety, is this working? Are you getting we're getting vaccine safety data in near real time? So yeah, the near real-time surveillance that the FDA has published on it. It was it was designed actually by Martin Koldorf. He's one of the main authors on the original paper of that did real near real-time surveillance purposes to identify serious harms by this vaccine rapidly while it's being administered to basically stop essentially stop it if necessary to withdraw it if necessary. They published the first the first publication of this was 21 months after the vaccine was authorized so the majority of the majority of most countries have already taken the vaccine at that point and the many have taken a booster I believe it was probably the fourth or fifth booster was being recommended at that at the point of publication of this near near real-time surveillance. So by near real-time surveillance the FDA mean a 21-month delay. Yeah to be fair they put it in quotes. It means laugh it if it wasn't so serious this is laughable. Yeah it's it's not it's not ideal no but um yeah it's not do you know no no absolutely is there risk of false positives in the FDA data that something could be thought of being an adverse event which actually really was the risk of false negatives. Well they very oh they discuss it very in detail in their paper about that they designed their surveillance to avoid false positives and they made multiple different decisions along the way to avoid false positives and you know there's various things they could do and how they do their statistical testing. They had they also said that you know if they had a group of anonymous experts who judged each adverse event of special interests that they were looking at and said okay if it has less than you know a relative risk of 1.25 so a 25 percent increase if it is less than that it's not clinically significant they didn't explain how they determine that but you know things like heart attack and stroke so if you have like a 24 percent increase in heart attacks or strokes they would they determine that to be not clinically significant which I find strange because you know we have drugs like such as a statin. I also find not strange. Yeah we have drugs like statins for which we know in people who've had heart attacks they reduce their chances of a of heart attack by about you know one close to 1 percent and uh so why are we why are we even using a drug that reduces heart attacks by 1 percent if it's not clinically significant to do so it's a it's a relative inconsistency I see between those two things and so the false positives that they're trying to reduce I understand because if you find a false positive for a harm yeah it will be that you can put it worse than it actually was. Yes yeah and you can maybe even withdraw a product unnecessarily that has all this benefit and that's definitely their concern and uh but the problem is for surveillance studies a false positive is actually not that bad because what you do with a false positive is you just study it again and you determine if it's a false positive because if it's a false positive when you study it again it will go away and you will realize that it's a false positive um however with false negatives which it just so happens if you design a study to avoid false positives it's like a dial essentially where you could either avoid false negatives or avoid false positives but you're gonna whatever you dial it one way it makes the other one more likely yeah so they dialed it all the way towards avoiding false positives which means that there's a possibility for false negatives the problem of a surveillance study is you missing missing significant event missing real harm missing real harm but you don't know it's there and if you do that with surveillance the problem is that if you miss a false negative you don't do an additional study to identify that false to confirm that false negative because you don't even know that it happened you don't know what you don't know yes you don't see it so with a surveillance study typically you would actually want to turn the dial towards avoiding false negatives at the cost of false positives and so I found that concerning actually we found that my me and my co-authors for that we we wrote it's a peer-reviewed critique of the surveillance system that is highly concerning it they in fact they didn't even in the younger age group they failed to identify that Moderna was causing that the Moderna vaccine caused myocarditis and when we know that that is is occurring it shows that that your system is simply not adequate for for doing this if it can't identify something that is increasing we know it's an obviously associated it's not even a debated thing it's increasing the relative risk so high that everyone who studies it identifies it so the fact that it didn't identify it didn't signal it that that is should raise everyone's red flag that this this system is not adequate for for surveillance for for our population some may talk about difficulties in adequacy others may say a complete waste of time and a racket but people will interpret that differently there's different ways to interpret it yeah um the FDA seems to be defining what is minimally clinically significant things that are minimally clinically significantly significant if there's enough of them would be immensely clinically significant to me um well they yes I think that's actually what their numbers are based on uh they're they're they're saying if you know if you have a 26 percent increase in in heart attacks that would be clinically significant because it would affect so many people but if you had a 10 percent or 15 percent or 20 percent increase in heart attacks that's it's too small of a number of heart attacks that it maybe it's not I presume they don't explain it very well they they how they how these experts determined these these numbers and and the fact that most of them are just 1.2 5 down the down the road suggests that they didn't use any sort of mathematical equation for determining the background rate of saying okay this many more of these is bad um so I mean I don't know how they came up with it but they said that they did say they said that they were experts and are they collecting data from all 50 states no the the data for this for the near real-time surveillance is based on insurance data from seven states so they so they're missing out 43 states they are missing out in 43 states but uh you know I don't know I don't know they don't have the data for the other 43 states my the the biggest concern from uh you know any sort of epidemiological evaluation is that uh they didn't say how they choose chose those seven states so they can choose them how they how they please and and when you can choose things how you please in in epidemiological studies you can find results that are there that that you could find results that aren't there or you could or you could avoid finding results that that are there uh and uh it's hot you know for example the the CDC they did a masking study I know where they showed that masking I think in school I want to say with school masking or mask mandates were effective when you looked at this six week or two month period this period and then another group did this study and they expanded it to six months and the effect went away so it's like when you just choosing random numbers and you're not explain what when you're just choosing random data sets and not explaining where that data is coming or why it was chosen uh it leads that up to you know the readers for their imagination they can come up with any reason that these data sets were chosen i'm just a problem at it 43 states don't worry about it it's just yeah good point that it's also possible that states because they have different different different demographics of course you can you can presume it's possible that the vaccines harmful in certain demographics that some states may not have so you would really want to make sure that you're looking at it you know sub lots of subgroup analyses and such but uh if states just don't have a higher percentage of something then you just won't see it if it's specific to that to that disease state you know that come over there. So if the fluidity might have more older people all we're good you might have less older people. Exactly yeah exactly yeah or even Alaska you have more males than females I know and like you know that would be you know there's so there are there is just different demographics between the states that uh uh different co-morbidities different occupation groups that's the differences. I would just want to see a reason a reason why. Sure I think there needs to at least be a rationale and they probably have one but they didn't publish it and they didn't respond to our our critique. Yeah so all the different places the FDA getting data from is this all pulled into a central spreadsheet for pulled centralized analysis. That's actually one of the worst parts of that near real-time surveillance uh just so they have three insurance data data sets and they typically you would take them all together. Yeah. Add them all together to increase your power because that actually what that does is that increases that that will decrease your chance of false negatives and decrease your chance of false positives. Yeah. So if they're still concerned about false positives why they to run to run it three different times that's a that's the zest that's bad for false positives in a sense but um it's it's also bad it's it's also bad for false negatives so and typically you would pull those three the all the data sets that you have and they did not. It's like a meta them like a meta analysis. Yeah you know I my first year students know that the more people you have in the study the more likely you are to get valid data out of it. This is pretty basic stuff. It's you yes and no I mean it gives you more power but if there's if there's confounders within the data set already that just gives you more more likelihood to identify the confounder that that exists. So it's possible more isn't always better it's you want it to be as well controlled as possible and such but uh but yeah you're more likely to find the difference between groups that's that's for certain. Yeah and is is all this data from the FDA published for independent peer review and analysis? No no no that they haven't published in their journal article that the individual data is not is not available for for reanalysis from those seven states or if there data exists from the other 43 it's not it's not been made public. I also would point out this pooling thing it. I don't know the reason why the FDA didn't pool theirs but they you know how they have it in three different cutting it off into three different data sets. It just reminds me of this of this technique that used that I think is still probably done by companies where they're getting when there's a lawsuit for maybe you know a toxin that they put into the water or something like that they'll they'll still go to the trial with like five or six different data sets saying look are our toxins not doesn't cause cancer when you look at it we we looked at it in six different different ways and it didn't find cancer in any way but if someone takes those six trials together and you put up you put them together and while we hold the toxin will cause cancer but they keep them separate to prevent to win a lawsuit and I you know I don't know that I I can't imagine that the FDA would do something in the same manner as as a as a company trying to avoid you know a lawsuit however it is I just find it strange that they would do something that that is very similar so I and I like I said I don't they they they have not explained their rationale for why they've done it in such a fashion but I would love for them to explain that that would be excellent for us quite a few strange things really yeah it's fascinating that research is science and a bit of an art form isn't it really that the whole topic of research and that it can be used for immense good but it can also be used to present a particular perspective in the right hands double-edged sword oh yes that's it is very much the case I mean there's yes there it is very something it's always bothered me in science when you read through it and you you read like activism activist science in a sense of you know people who are convinced of their result and they go around designing a study in such a fashion to to obtain that result and you see it with financial interests and you can also see it with people who just have a you know for whatever reason a bias towards one result being the case but cleverly designed studies can can often lead people to to the wrong conclusion it's and it's it's why it's so important that any for any study that your public that a people publish that that they released their their transparent and that they released their data for other people to analyze and that's definitely true for anyone for anything with financial interest but I I think it's true for even non-financial interest like our group for example we we've been fully transparent with our our data and and we would we would ask that the the FDA be transparent with the COVID vaccine data Pfizer and Moderna be transparent I there really is not a good reason that we shouldn't be if we're all here have the same goal of of trying to identify the truths of what we're doing here with our with our clinical medical medical interventions like that should that's our goal that should be the goal of everyone involved but and because it's I understand that if our studies incorrect right that that I want people to take our data replicate our study and show us that we're wrong and where you know I would love for someone to do replication studies and you know show that our studies right or show that we got some things wrong and that would be very useful that's that's the right way to do science is that we you know keep a transparent let it be repeated let's figure out what's true what's not true but yeah things are a little harder right now with that all we want to do is discern the nature of reality might work out what's efficacious work out what the dangers are for the benefit of everyone which is what your work has done so on behalf of well the entire population's really of our countries thank you for everything you've done and um yeah we wish we wish you well in in all your endeavors it's uh it's an impressive piece of work and uh also impressive answers from the interview if you've got to the end of it well done so thank you for watching thank you thank you doctor Freeman from all the way from Louie's Anna so great to talk to you thank you it has been a pleasure maybe we could do it again sometime okay yeah thank you thank you"
New details on Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine side effects,Click On Detroit | Local 4 | WDIV,2020-12-08,MrmiEBmeumA,"But we are just two days away from the FDA public meeting to consider whether to issue an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. As promised today, the FDA released the data that will be used that is very central to that decision. And our Dr. Frank Mejorge been digging through it. He's back with a closer look at a really important part of this doc. And that's the potential side effects that have turned up thus far. Exactly, Kim and Devon. So most of the vaccines, we get trigger a few minor side effects from a sore arm to some fatigue or a fever. But Pfizer's data finds the COVID-19 vaccine did trigger some predictable side effects in most participants. And that is something people should definitely be prepared for. The most commonly reported side effect was pain at the injection site, particularly after the second dose of the vaccine. Nearly 78 percent of those age 18 to 55 reported pain after dose 2, 66 percent of participants over 55 experienced that symptom as well. About half reported the pain was mild. Redness and swelling were similar for both age groups, but they occurred in only about 4 to 7 percent of participants. In general, participants under 55 had more frequent and more severe side effects, especially after the second dose. In the younger age group after the second dose, 59 percent reported fatigue. Nearly 52 percent experienced a headache. 37 percent reported muscle pain and 35 percent had chills. Less common symptoms included fever, vomiting, diarrhea or joint pain. In those over 55 after the second dose, over 50 percent reported fatigue. 39 percent suffered a headache. Nearly 29 percent had muscle pain and nearly 23 percent reported chills. In all ages, most of the symptoms occurred in the first day or two after receiving the vaccine, and most often lasted about a day. Swollen lymph nodes were also reported more often in people who received the vaccine compared to those who received the placebo. Now there were four cases of Bell's palsy that occurred in the group that received the vaccine. Bell's palsy has a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis of certain muscles in the face. It is not clear that there is a connection to the vaccine, but the FDA will recommend surveillance for that side effect in particular if the vaccine is authorized. Frank, this vaccine works very differently from, say, the flu vaccine. So I ask this question advisedly, no, they don't work the same way. But do we have any idea why those side effects come in that first day or two? Then we would say typically see a flu shot. Yeah, Devon, well it's thought to be from an immune inflammatory reaction to both the mRNA, that's the genetic material in the vaccine, as well as the lipid material that's used to get that genetic material into cells. This is, as you mentioned, a very different type of vaccine. So of course, it's not surprising that we're seeing different reactions. It seems to be in store with that. All right, Doc."
"Latest research on vaccine side effects, immune reaction and thrombosis risks | COVID-19 Special",DW News,2021-04-15,j6Sn07fQeYM,"Vaccines are turning the tide, but they're not without risks, especially for women. There have been rare cases of blood clotting, even fatal ones, leading some governments to slow down vaccinations. We have now today chosen to continue our vaccine rollout without AstraZeneca. But each delay puts more lives at risk as the coronavirus spreads. It's a balancing act between speed and caution in the fight against COVID-19. The risk of dying from COVID is much higher than getting a blood clot from a vaccine. But even more concerning is a new report from Oxford University that shows catching the coronavirus puts you at even more risk of a deadly blood clot. In a moment, we'll talk to a vaccine scientist at Johns Hopkins University, first this report. AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vector vaccine has hardly been out of the headlines since last December. Until now, it's been instrumental in the success of the UK's vaccination program. But from now on, its use there will be restricted to those over 30 years of age. There have been worries in the European Union about its effectiveness and potential side effects. Germany initially restricted its use to under-65s. Now Berlin is recommending it purely for over 60s. Those worries were compounded by several cases of a rare thrombosis type following AstraZeneca vaccinations, some of them fatal. The European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam felt it was time to take a stance on the jab. Its director stressing that the benefits of the antiviral agent far outweigh any risks. This vaccine has proven to be highly effective. It prevents severe disease and hospitalization, and it is saving lives. Vaccination is extremely important in helping us in the fight against COVID-19, and we need to use the vaccines we have to protect us from the devastating effects. Scientists have been investigating the reports and circumstances of the thrombosis. Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Regulator Agency says 20 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered by the end of March, with 79 cases of a thrombosis later reported, 19 of which were fatal. The cause is thought to be a rare immune reaction. Most of them presented some two weeks after inoculation. There are no apparent risk groups such as age or sex. Several countries like Germany, France and Canada have tightened restrictions on the use of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine. Others have suspended it totally, waiting for the EMA's verdict. It has now recommended the continued unrestricted use of the AstraZeneca jab, regardless of any rare cases of thrombosis. So mixed messages there about vaccine safety. To unpack this, let's bring in quarter-talatges of vaccine scientists in infectious disease position at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. So let's start with AstraZeneca. As we heard, that's been given to more than half the adults in Britain and is credited with saving tens of thousands of lives. I'd gladly take it, but authorities here in Germany and other countries are blocking its use and offering no timely alternative. Isn't that in itself putting people's lives in danger? So when you have a pandemic that's out of control, like we have with the COVID-19 pandemic, then any facts, then you have to weigh the risks and benefits of any available preventive, such as a vaccine or treatment. And for the AstraZeneca vaccine, it has been shown to have saved millions of lives already. And so the potential benefits might outweigh any risks. Now, there are some very serious risks associated with it in very, very rare circumstances. And I think each country, but also each individual needs to be able to weigh that risk-benefit equation for themselves to decide whether or not they're willing to take that risk for the protection against the virus. When you have a vaccine that's available and that's not being used, people can die. And that's something that each government and each person needs to weigh. And this isn't only a problem with AstraZeneca. We've now got Johnson and Johnson. Six million immunized in the United States. And yet it's on hold because six people may have had side effects. Isn't one in a million an acceptable risk level during times like these? So I think that the equation in the United States is a little bit different because we've vaccinated so many of our high-risk individuals already. And we have two other approved vaccines that are more available than the Johnson and Johnson vaccine even is. And I think whereas Europe has been gathering information about the AstraZeneca vaccine for several weeks, we are just starting to learn about any potential risks associated with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. And so I think the pause is to gather that information to truly understand what that risk is. Is it one in a million or is there something higher? Is it even associated is the the clots that we saw with in those unfortunate women associated with it? And so I think the the the pause is appropriate while we gather that information and make a decision about the risk benefits. But I think in places where there's the virus is increasing in terms of the transmission and there is no alternative vaccine that it should be seriously considered to use this vaccine while that data is being gathered. In the US the calculus is a little bit different because we do have two alternative vaccines and don't seem to have that same risk. The strange thing though is that and this is what will get many people especially women worried about this is that those people affected by clotting were women in a certain age group and it's been a similar profile for AstraZeneca as well. So why is it being blocked for everyone or everyone under 60 or so? I am that is probably out due to logistics and programmatic issues but also because while we're gathering that information we need to understand better what that risk is and who truly is at risk while the majority people who have been affected so far seem to be women. There were men in Europe who have had this unusual rare blood clot happen. There was one man in the trial in the United States who had this unusual blood clot occur. And so we need to gather that information and understand the process better and who truly is at risk to be able to maybe target the vaccines at people who are at lower risk. But you know it's interesting that you say that because there's a lot of adverse events from vaccines that seem to particularly affect women and especially women in their reproductive years. And that's probably because our hormones are different than in the pre-imposed reproductive period and also from men. And that may put us at that may give us an advantage or a benefit but they may also put us at some increased risk from the adverse events. If you look at the anaphylaxis cases that are happening after the mRNA vaccines in the United States of ass majority of them are happening in women as well. So there's just there's a difference in the biology between men and women that we're just starting to understand. Can we go as far as saying that vector vaccines could be the problem? In terms of the clotting that's been seen? Exactly. Yeah. In terms of adverse events? In terms of clotting and or adverse events. So each vaccine is going to have its different adverse events. Each vaccine platform has different kinds of adverse events that happen. And so for the vector vaccines, especially for AstraZeneca, potentially for Johnson and Johnson as well, it looks like clotting may be an increased risk factor that we didn't see with the mRNA vaccines. And in the United States, over 100 million people have now been vaccinated with one of the two mRNA vaccines without the same sort of signal that we've seen with the with the with the adenovirus vaccines. But this has not necessarily been seen with other adenovirus vaccines in the past. So we need to better understand what is happening. And I think that this pause allows scientists and researchers to really dig deep into each of these cases to better understand what's happening and also to understand the mechanisms a little bit better. And it's been fantastic having you on the show explaining to us what all this means. Koso Talaat of Johns Hopkins University. Thank you very much for being on the show today. Thank you very much. Take care. Whatever the risks, vaccines are here to stay for now. More on that from Derek Williams. Will we only have to be vaccinated once or will we need regular booster shots? Once again, the straightforward answer is we don't know yet. But a lot of experts do think it's very likely that even fully vaccinated people will need booster shots in the future. There are a couple of different reasons why that might become necessary. The first involves the fact that the vaccines we're using now have been approved for emergency use because they were safe in the vast majority of people who've gotten them and also extremely effective, at least in the short term. But we still don't know how long that effectiveness on average will last. Don't forget, it's been under a year since the very first subjects and trials received their first shots. But based on what we know about naturally acquired immunity to the disease and what we know about other coronaviruses, the general expectation among immunologists appears to be that most vaccinated people will remain largely immune to COVID-19 for at least six months and likely retain at least some immunity for a year or two, assuming the virus doesn't mutate faster than we think. However, nearly all the experts I've read now also think that down the line, variants of SARS-CoV-2 will change enough that will have to modify current vaccines at some point. So the companies that make them are already in trials looking at possible ways to prolong vaccine-induced immunity. And a lot of those trials will involve giving test subjects booster shots of tweaked vaccines. You heard it from Derek Williams. I'm Ben Fizzoulin. Thanks for watching. Stay safe and see you again soon."
Vaccine side effects are actually a good thing,Vox,2021-02-11,F6NKbQzo4aE,"This is every step in the process of developing a vaccine. From development in the lab, testing, approval, manufacturing, all the way to getting it to millions of people. But arguably, the most important part is here in the human trials, where the vaccine is tested on real people in three main phases, starting with just a small group of people and ultimately testing a group of thousands. This is where scientists confirm the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine on a large scale. Before that, scientists scrutinize its effectiveness. But before any of that, a vaccine first has to pass this crucial phase, where scientists study the side effects. In a trial, you call it adverse events, but that doesn't, that's kind of overstating it. Dr. Kirsten Lake led a phase one trial for the COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and Biontech. She says side effects are a possibility with any vaccine. In general, it's nothing to fear. It's our own immune systems kicking in and doing what it's supposed to do. The most common flu vaccine this year, for example, comes with a chance for many normal side effects, pain, fatigue, headaches. But many of the new COVID-19 vaccines are more likely to cause these kinds of side effects than you might be used to, particularly after the second dose. Most people will feel a little pain in their arm. Many will be tired and get headaches. I mean, obviously, having no side effects is desirable, but I think with the spike protein in the coronavirus, it really does elicit some side effects. But that's totally normal. And once you understand why vaccine side effects happen, you might actually be happy to get them. First, we have to talk about this, your immune system, which is a huge network of different cells and proteins in your body. You've got things like white blood cells that fight the invading virus or bacteria, communication cells that organize the response, and antibodies that search for and identify the enemy. When, say, a virus attacks your body, your immune system attacks back. Your body increases blood flow to get more of these battle cells in circulation. Your temperature might go up, too, as one of the tactics your body has to help kill the invaders. And after your white blood cells destroy the virus, they produce antibodies that will identify the virus, shouldn't reappear in the future, and remember how to fight it. There how you gain immunity. This response is actually what gives you a lot of the symptoms you feel when you catch, for example, the common cold. But the cold virus doesn't give you a fever or runny nose or body aches, your immune system does while fighting the virus. And triggering this system without actually getting you sick is how vaccines work. Most vaccines are made up of a weakened or dead pathogen or a portion of one, or in some of the new COVID-19 vaccines, the genetic code of a portion of one, either in the form of DNA or what's called messenger RNA, along with minor ingredients to keep it stable. It's harmless, but when your immune system detects it, it responds just like it's a real danger. It attacks the intruder and creates these memory antibodies to be able to fight it again in the future. Vaccines are designed to give you the same immunity as if you would thought off the real virus. And some of the new COVID-19 ones do this particularly well. And messenger RNA vaccines are quite good at simulating your immune system. That's why you have 95 percent efficacy. That's right, a 95 percent chance of being protected against COVID-19. That makes them some of the most effective vaccines. But that also means they're really good at activating your immune system, which means your body will increase blood flow to where the vaccine is, which is why pain at the injection site is so common. Your body might even think better turn up the heat and then you get a fever or the chills. So experts emphasize that we should look at most side effects as a good thing. It means the vaccine is working. I have a friend actually who participated in one of the Pfizer trials, early trials. And you know, so he could have gotten either placebo or vaccine. And we have to the second dose. The next day he woke up and he had, he was sort of fatigued and he had low grade fever and he looked at his wife and said, yes, I got the vaccine. See, that's the right attitude. When we talk about these common reactions to vaccines, like fever and fatigue, we're mostly talking about the mild to moderate ones. These are the lowest of the side effect categories that health regulators use. The kind you get over in a day or two. Then there's severe side effects, the type that might make you call in sick to work or call a doctor. These were rare in the clinical trials for the first two studied vaccines to become available, with the exception of some severe fatigue and muscle pain on the second dose. And that's because of these vaccines were dangerous. They'd never reach the public in the first place. We really don't accept any sort of permanent serious harm from a vaccine, and nor should we. New stories that imply otherwise can be scary, but they get more attention than they probably deserve. Like this one about a serious allergic reaction, in someone with a history of serious allergic reactions, or this one about someone dying after getting a second dose of the vaccine, when it turned out other factors had caused his death. In fact, no dust have been reported from the millions of doses that have been given out. And the controlled studies with thousands of people found the same thing, no dust from the vaccine. But maybe more importantly, the studies also recorded zero deaths from COVID-19, and zero hospitalizations from COVID-19. These vaccines aren't just safe, they're life savers. You should be skeptical of anything you put in your body, including vaccines, or but once you've seen the data and you see that there wasn't a serious side effect before approval and hasn't been a serious side effect possible, then I think you should be convinced. Basically, you want to reduce where the virus can go. And if you immunize as many people as possible, that whole of people that it can transmit to, becomes less and less and less and less. Vaccines are the way out of the COVID-19 pandemic. And like with all vaccines, many of us who get it will also feel a little, meh, for a day or two. But the scientists who have studied these vaccines, who have seen the side effects, are some of the most eager to get it. I couldn't wait to get this vaccine. You kidding me? I mean, two doses of vaccine gives me a 95 percent chance of being protected. We would be the first ones to not want to take it if we felt it was unsafe, right? So, um, take it from your friendly vaccine person."
"Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, side effects from second dose",ABC10,2021-04-07,O0fqPlbSyzA,"The CDC says that you may experience more side effects after the second dose to the COVID-19 vaccine than the first. But why are some people getting sick while others aren't? I say it's a verify. Are younger people more likely to get side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine than those who are older? I would straight to the experts to get answers. I spoke with Dr. Dean Bloomberg, who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases with UC Davis Health and referred to a study done on vaccine side effects published by the Centers for Disease Control. Dr. Bloomberg says younger people have a stronger immune response to vaccination, so they will have higher antibody levels following immunization. The younger people may have a more robust immune system, a stronger immune response, and that leads to more of the side effects because the immune system gets a bit rough up. But does that mean that older people will have fewer symptoms after the second dose? The CDC says during clinical trials, participants were asked to complete diaries of their symptoms. Their frequency of side effects were higher in the younger age group of 18 to 55 year olds at 83 percent. Compared to the older 55 plus age group at 71 percent. The average younger people do have more side effects following immunization. They have more local side effects, such as the pain and the swelling, the redness at the injection site, as well as systemic side effects, such as fever, fatigue, headache. So we can verify, yes, that younger people will experience more side effects after the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine than people who are older."
Viral Vaccine paper,Dr. John Campbell,2023-07-05,IZAso_eLJLI,"Well, one welcome to today's talk. It's Wednesday the 5th of July. Now today's talk is really quite interesting. It deals with data which is highly, let's think of a word, anomalous. It actually shows the incidence of suspected adverse reactions to the fires of vaccine. There is, by a factor of thousands, thousands fold differences, depending on the batch of vaccines that was given. And this is based on a paper that's actually going viral at the moment from Denmark. Later on we'll be talking about the difficulty in getting this paper published, but it was actually published now in a peer-reviewed journal. And the data really is quite incredible. And I've also had the privilege of interviewing one of the authors today, which I'll give you more information on in a minute of talk to the lead author quite extensively today. So this is the paper here. Vaccine dependent safety and the fires of vaccine depends on the batch. Very much depends on the batch. And just to give you a flavour of this, to see if you want to watch this video. 71 percent of suspected adverse reactions, the SARs, occurred in 4.2 percent of the vaccine batches. And this is quite incredible. And as we say, the variation was in factors of thousands. Now here we have a graph here. Now this is the graph from the authors. Now what this is showing is anything any dot here, higher up is related to more suspected adverse events. Any dot lower down is related to less suspected adverse events. And as we see here, the authors put them into clusters. So we've got this blue cluster here, mostly vaccines given early. Then we've got this intermediate green one here. And then we've got this yellow one on the bottom. And we see that here, for example, we have massively high rates of adverse reactions. Now let me just show you a bit about this graph on in another slightly different format here. So here we have this graphic here. Now this is the blue group here of very high adverse reactions up here. Now this highest reaction here means that there was one suspected adverse reaction per 20 doses of the vaccine given. Now this is just, well, put a word in here. Every 20 doses of the vaccine given, there was one suspected adverse reaction. Absolutely incredible. When we look at this green group here, we did see an increase in adverse reactions with these batches. But here, the highest dose, that the highest most adverse reactions there in the green group was one in a thousand. And these are specific batches. I've got these directly from the authors. So batch EJ6134, given our early in 2021 for every 20 vaccine dose is given. There was one suspected adverse event slightly later on for vaccine dose Ew6126. There was one in a thousand still too high. And then later on, this yellow group down the bottom has been associated with no adverse reactions. Now perhaps the reason that this group on the bottom has been associated with zero adverse reactions is the fact that the data is not all in yet. So as time goes on, this yellow line will lift slightly from the baseline. But that's what we're seeing here. Incredibly high rates of adverse reactions early on in the pandemic. And that as I was saying, most of these blue batches were pre-Apal 2021. Now just to be completely clear, the authors had no conflict of interest other than certain papers that could be discussed where there's potential conflict of interest. The authors worked very, very hard on this, on the own. And this is the data that got. Let's get down to a bit of the detail now because this really is, this really is incredible. I mean, if I'd known, if I'd known about this graph and these high rates of potential side effects, one in 20 vaccines given, come on. Is there any way I would have accepted that vaccine? In fact, it had known I was on the green line somewhere with one in a thousand. I wouldn't have taken it either. There's just a huge issue here of informed consent. Now, these batches were given out all over the world. Perhaps not in the United States. The United States tended to make their own batches, the Europeans and to, to in extent the Antipodeans make, make, make, you've shared their own batches as well. So this is perhaps a pan-European batch that was given here. So this is affecting everywhere presumably, this vaccine was given outside of the United States. And there's no reason for a treatment different in the United States. The only wire would have accepted the vaccine if it would been on the yellow line. If we'd known that the race of adverse suspected adverse reactions were anything like as high, I would have not touched it with a barge pole. What I weren't we told, where is the informed consent? It's outrageous. Anyway, let's stick to the data and not get two cross. As we've said, 721 percent of suspected adverse reactions occurred in 4.2 participants with massive differences. I hope it's clear to you that each of these dots is a batch. So these are vaccine batches. Massive difference in reported adverse reactions between the different batches of vaccine. And this is hard firm mathematical statistically significant data. Now, no conflicts of interest, that's the graph as we've said there. And we can see clearly we have the blue group, the green group and the yellow group. Now, the blue group vaccines were mostly given early. The green ones and the yellow ones were mostly given later. Not entirely, that's not how these are classified, these are the clusters that the analysis of the batches fell into. And again, all based on specific batches, if you talk to the authors, they'll give you the batch number for each one of these dots. It's a very nicely conducted piece of science. So a number of suspected adverse events, as we say, massive varies massively between the vaccine batches. And this is all after the Pfizer vaccine in Denmark. And why has it been left with you Danish academics to do this? Why did the British regulatory authorities do this? Or the German regulatory authorities or the Danish regulatory authorities? Or the American or the Canadian regulatory authorities? Why has this left to independent academics? Unfunded independent academics to come up with this vital, absolutely vital insight. 27th December 2020 to the 11th of January 2022, based on a population of 5.8 million, and according to the number of doses per vaccine batch. Now, what we do see is that there's a positive correlation between number of vaccines in the batch and the increased rate of side effects. But the author today, I did talk to Dr. Vibha Kamanika today, lead author, and she said they can't put too much weight on this at the moment. But there is definitely a trend that the larger the number of vaccine vials in the batch, the more adverse reactions there is. There's a positive correlation there. We can't say more than that at the moment though. But the authors are working on are still working on this. Now, by November the 11th 2022 in the European area, 711 million doses of Pfizer vaccine given 971,021 reported suspected adverse events. Clinical data on individual vaccine batch levels have not been reported anywhere. Oh, this is the first time this has been done. Why? The whole point, the whole point of having a batch number is so this can be done. The whole point of, I've been writing batch numbers down for the last 40 years after giving medications and vaccines and different things. And the whole point is if there's an adverse event, we can go back and look at the batch. Why did the regulator, your authorities, let us down, completely fail you and me on this ongoing post marketing surveillance that we were promised. It hasn't happened according to the batch apart from a few independent, hardworking, Danish, academics, bless them. We've done a fantastic job. Batch dependent variable variability in the clinical efficacy efficacy and safety of vaccines would appear to be highly unlikely is what we were told until you actually look at the data and then you find out, well, hey, actually, no, there is actually massive variation, strangely enough. Right, so the author say we therefore examine rates of suspected adverse reactions between different vaccine doses in Denmark. All this data on suspected adverse reactions from the Danish medical agency. And of course, you and me both know that by no means all of the adverse reactions that actually occur are reported. So I think we can say these, I think we can say these are minimum levels of adverse reactions without too much fear of contradiction. So it's a various suspected adverse reactions, seriousness was serious. So suspected adverse reactions seriousness was classified as non-serious or serious. And that in the series included hospitalisation or prolonged or existing or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, life threatening illnesses, permanent disability or congenital malformation or another potential side effect another potential serious adverse reaction. The data was fully anonymised so this is a completely ethical study. Suspected adverse events were counted on a batch level by linking individual suspected adverse events to the batch labels, the batch numbers. They were able to get this data from the Danish authorities or be it after some difficulty it has to be said as you'll find out of you if you watch the video. I'm going to give later on the next video. Now the data was actually based, that's this data here that the authors have was actually based on 10.7 million doses of ministered vaccine just over 4 million individual people. 52 different Pfizer vaccine doses says huge sample sizes and the batch is contained 2,340 to 841.000 doses per batch and as we say there's a trend for the ones with higher numbers in the batch to have more adverse reactions, the authors say we can't put too much significance on that till they've done further work although the positive correlation is obvious to the human eye of course as you can see without me pointing out. 43,496 suspected adverse reactions were registered in 13,635 people so these are big sample numbers. 61,000 overall were identified were able to be identified to the batches. Unfortunately 23.5 percent of the adverse reactions 14,509 were described as severe and 579.0.9 percent of those reported were severe, are more severe adverse reaction, resulting in irreversible adverse reaction. Unexpectedly the rates per thousand dose vary considerably between vaccine batches you can say that again from one or essentially zero on the yellow line but as we say with this yellow line the probably will be the probably will be some that do emerge at a later date there is a bit of a lag in the reporting in the Danish system. So basically from one per 20 doses to one in many thousands of doses to zero. Now other variables here vaccine manufacturing, vaccine storage, vaccine transportation, clinical handling control, administration techniques of course could all bear some influence on these data. But there we have it it is quite incontrovertible by this data. Massive changes, massive rates in the reported suspected adverse reactions including serious adverse reactions depending on the vaccine batch. I hesitate to be flippant but I just hope you were given one of the if you were vaccinated that you were given one of the batches that were nearer this end of the graph than the top end of the graph. There was no significant variation between the ages of people in either group because early on there was a lot of young people given the vaccine in the start of start of 2021 in Denmark in other words the blue vaccine doses. For one simple reason there were healthcare workers. So a lot of young healthcare workers were vaccinated as well as the elderly and the frailer people. And the difference is in the difference in different age groups between the different blue, green and yellow clusters is not significant. So there we have that. Now I have actually interviewed one of the researchers. I'm not going to play it all but this is Dr. V. Bicke Manicke. I think I might put this on the next video but I'll just I'll just wet your appetite on this one. Well I'm warm welcome to this talk and I'm delighted to welcome Dr. V. Bicke Manicke who's who's a Dr of research here in Denmark. Welcome V. Bicke thank you for coming on. Thank you very much and thank you for being on your show. Thank you. Now we basically want to say not going to play that now it goes on for quite some time. So I'm going to put it on the next video. Dr. V. Bicke Manicke completely committed scientist, totally committed, has done nearly all this work in a spare time with colleagues. Published this paper after significant difficulties, it was turned by and by quite a quite a bit of the four big major medical journals which is a problem in itself finally published in another journal fully peer reviewed. So there we go. It looks like we could do with an explanation on why there was so much variability, massive variability between vaccine doses. It looks like the doses given out to the end of 2021 and 2022 were probably associated with less severe, less suspected adverse reactions. Of course by that time a lot of people already had natural infection. So it's complicated but that data is hard data, it is hard science and I've related to you as best as I can. Watch the next video for Dr. Manicke giving us a lot more detail on this. Look right, motion left for that. Compensation of severe annoyance, well not annoyance, total outrage that this data was not made public. It's very high rates of adverse reactions, but not made public. So I couldn't give my informed consent. As you couldn't either. But knowing that wouldn't have touched it with a large ball. Let down to put it in my order. Thank you for watching."
Long list of side effects to look out for,Dr. John Campbell,2022-03-11,EASM6EzCVeg,"It's Friday the 11th of March; actually, it's nearly Saturday. I’m working a bit late today, but just before we get on to some interesting things about the vaccine side effects that we wanted to clarify, there’s a story that needs clarifying here. Now, we looked at this a couple of days ago: treatment with ivermectin is associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients, and it’s an analysis of a national federated database. It’s an abstract from a conference paper presentation, and we did look at this conclusion here—treatment with ivermectin was associated with decreased mortality in patients with COVID-19 compared to Remdesivir. So far, so good, but I was actually listening to Dr. Bean today, and he thinks that this has been withdrawn. I checked on this, and it does in fact appear that this has been withdrawn, as reported here in AP News. Apparently, the abstract is flawed—flawed research abstracts, so there’s something wrong with it. Now, given that the abstract is flawed, everything I’ve said about it is flawed, obviously, because I could only say what was in the abstract, so everything we’ve said is completely null and void; it’s been withdrawn. But it’s a bit strange because this is the live link here, and there’s nothing to say it’s withdrawn on there. Now, what you would normally expect is this example here: a retracted paper. I think you’ll agree with me that’s pretty unambiguously retracted, but not so on that one. So, quite what’s going on there is not entirely clear, but it does look like it’s been withdrawn, so anything we said about it is predicated on nothing because the abstract’s been withdrawn; it essentially no longer exists. I do apologize for you wasting 10 minutes of your time watching that video, and I’m also a bit annoyed that I wasted several hours of my life reading and preparing it. So, it’s completely null and void now, but still a little strange, so it would be nice to have an unambiguous retracted thing like that on it, but there you go; that’s what we have. Apparently, there’s been a lot of kerfuffle on it on Twitter, but I don’t really follow Twitter that much, so I’m not really sure. But we’ll leave it at that. Basically, we have to ignore everything we said about it because the abstract is withdrawn, and therefore it’s based on nothing. You can’t put solid footsteps into fresh air; you need solid ground, and if it doesn’t exist, it’s been taken away. A pity, wasted time on it. Now let’s go into the main topic that I wanted to look at today, which is actually pretty interesting if I can get into it. See what we’re doing? Again, there are so many technical things you’ve got to get right all at the same time. So, that was the reference for that one. Now, a complete list of the Pfizer adverse events of special interest. There’s no two ways to put this: I made a mistake here, so I apologize unconditionally because this list that we looked at, that I thought was the list of side effects, isn’t. Apparently, it’s the list that people need to look out for. So, this is the list published by Pfizer, and it looks like this list, which is indeed long, is a list of events that doctors and nurses should be looking out for, not events that have actually been reported. So, no two ways about it; my apologies, I got that wrong. But let’s just look at it a little more. This is adverse events; this is from the direct screenshots from the paper: adverse events and then adverse events of special interest. That’s from the, whatever you call it, the bit that tells you what all the titles stand for. And this is the lead-in to the actual list of side effects: cumulative analysis of post-authorization adverse events reports. Now, I think the problem here is that it’s just not very well phrased. Let me just show you that, but that’s it actually. It’s on top of all of them there, look, because it’s on top of all of them. So, they’re things to look out for. Now, to tell you the truth, I didn’t know this, and it turns out that several doctors I talked to, actually on both sides of the pond today, didn’t know it either. In fact, of the several doctors I talked to, none of them knew that this list was things they had to look out for. So, apparently, that’s what it is. So, let’s look in a little more detail. Now, I must confess because I wasn’t very up-to-date on this, I’ve basically plagiarized Dr. Jesse Santano on this, who publishes a nice sort of pre-say of it, so let’s look at what Dr. Santano is saying. An adverse event of special interest is an event of a particular product that should be monitored by a drug or vaccine manufacturing company, so something that they should be monitoring for. In other words, all doctors, nurses, and nurse practitioners involved in this should be monitoring for all of these. Now, I’ve had a look through these; I’m not going to bore you with them now, but I can work out what most of them mean, but not all of them, I must say. There’s some pretty obscure stuff here. I mean, off the cuff, I don’t know what Fettle Syndrome is; I know what a femoral artery embolism is, but if you see, there’s a lot of specialized terminology here, and then at the end, it just kind of stops—there you go. So, things that doctors have to look out for, but apparently most doctors and nurses don’t know they have to look out for it. Now, if they don’t know they have to look out for it, I would have thought this could lead to significant under-reporting because the doctors I’ve talked to didn’t know they had to look out for this. But let’s carry on with Dr. Santano’s rather useful analysis. It can be severe or non-serious, but it can lead to a serious medical condition, and he’s going according to this group here: the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, which seems to be related to the WHO and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, from memory. So, that does seem to be this recognized agency that’s put forward these guidelines. Dr. Santano again, where are we? Such events should be described in protocols or protocol amendments—good. We see rightly that that’s what Pfizer has done; that’s what this is. They have described it. A pity it took, my understanding is it took a court order to have this paper released. So, quite how you were exposed to know before the Freedom of Information court order, unless this wasn’t in the public domain before, but we looked before and it looked like this had been released as a result of a court order to me. Correct me if you think I’m wrong on that, but that’s what it looked like anyway. And instructions provided for investigators on how to and when they should report to the sponsor. I can’t see that—I can’t see any instructions there on this document as to how you report that. Sorry you’ll be getting dizzy looking at all these going up and down. I can’t see anything there before it saying how you report it, and I can’t see anything that was after it, rather, and I can’t see anything before either. No, it just says the summary there. So, can’t see that. So, they’re rightly including it, but I can’t see that. The original file’s appendix is a world of words indeed, with the diagnoses separated by semicolons. More than 95% of the adverse events listed are life-changing for the bad, so we certainly don’t want those. If you’re lucky enough to have a diagnosis from your doctor and he says it’s not related to the shot, now, of course, most of us wouldn’t think we’re particularly lucky to have a diagnosis from our doctor, but I think he means if you’re lucky enough to be able to see doctors because it is quite difficult at the moment. I’ve just had to—my last appointment was on a knee consult thing. But anyway, if your doctor says it’s not related to the shot, then Dr. Santano says, show them this list. So, we need to show—if you’ve got any problem that you think might be vaccine-related and your doctor says it’s not, then show them this list to make sure it’s not on this list. Because if it is on this list, then the adverse event should be reported. Clearly, it’s not a straightforward matter, but that’s what the guidelines are saying: show them this list to tell them that Pfizer is watching out for those complications. So, Pfizer put this there because I think they genuinely want to know if they are turning up. Dr. Santano again, many doctors, nurses, practitioners, or physicians don’t know. Well, I didn’t know, and the several doctors I talked to today didn’t know either. So, it looks like we’re pretty ignorant of that. Dr. Santano says, I didn’t until I read the whole list, so we are—well, Dr. Santano is clearly less ignorant than me because at least he knew that the list existed. Many of the conditions below are rare; that means doctors might have forgotten about them or not know about them. Rare also means there may be no standardized treatments for them, which could be a problem. The diagnosis on the list does not mean they always happen with COVID-19 shots, of course not. But anyone who got vaccinated and then diagnosed with the illness below should report it to Pfizer or theirs. So, given that most doctors and nurses from my completely unscientific straw poll don’t know it exists, how can they report it if they don’t know it exists? So, if you’re a nurse, practitioner, doctor, or physician’s assistant and you know this list exists, please tell me I’m wrong, but I didn’t know it existed, and several doctors I talked to today didn’t know it existed. The diagnosis may be months or years after the shot; you can still report them. The World Health Organization is also keeping an eye on adverse events of special interest, of course. Adverse events of special interest monitoring determines if there is a high incidence of specific disease in people who have had the COVID-19 shots. Well, we know, for example, that there is an increased risk of heart inflammation; we established that in yesterday’s video and indeed in many others. If the incidence is higher in people who’ve had the shots, they should stop using these vaccines. If more of the incidence is higher in people that have had the shots, so according to this thinking from Dr. Santano, there you go. That’s what this article is saying. I don’t feel I can comment on that, but that’s what this article seems to be saying. And these should be getting reported, that is, if they do their job. This list may be from Pfizer, but all who had COVID-19 shots, whatever the manufacturer, should report their diagnosis, of course. This is just a Pfizer paper that we have here. So, if doctors don’t know about these, then I’m not sure they can accurately report them. I mean, dear me, metastatic pulmonary embolism, I know what that means; microangiopathy, I know what that means, but some of them I don’t. I mean, yeah, most of them make sense, but some of these are things like Miller-Fisher Syndrome—I can’t remember what that is—or mitochondrial aspartate amino transferase increased—I haven’t got a clue about that. Mitochondrial diseases—I know an expert in mitochondrial diseases, but I think if you ask most doctors what mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase increased means, they’d be struggling as I am. So, there you go. Apologies, I got that wrong; it is not side effects that have been reported; it is side effects to look out for. But as we say, most doctors don’t seem to know about it. Now let’s finish with the report from our community health partner in Africa, in Uganda. Rafael is going to report on the state of the pandemic in Africa and Uganda, and the news seems to be pretty good, so over to Rafael, and thank you, Rafael, as always. Hello everyone, welcome to today’s COVID-19 update. I’m here to give you a brief report about Africa. As of today, Africa has confirmed a cumulative number of over 11.3 million COVID-19 cases, with a cumulative number of over 10.5 million recoveries. That means about 98 percent of all the people who got infected with COVID-19 in Africa have recovered, and Africa has lost a total of around 250,000 people to COVID-19. So that’s the brief information that I have on Africa so far, but when you look at the rate at which the cases are increasing, it is low compared to the time when we had the Delta variant. And now let’s look briefly at Uganda. I’ve not been able to get the vaccination information on Africa, but when I get it, I will be able to give you. So let’s look at Uganda. Uganda today confirmed a total of around 15 new cases out of a total of around 2,300 tests conducted; this gives us a positivity rate of around 0.6 percent. So this is low compared to the Delta variant, and as I told you, things so far, we are moving on well in Uganda because, as we talk, the economy is fully open, people gather freely, and people are enjoying the atmosphere now compared to the time when COVID-19 had just come. And the exciting news is that despite the full opening up of the economy, we have seen that the cases are still low, so we thank God for that, and we thank God for the health workers for all the work that they have done in trying to keep the virus low. And we thank God also for the Omicron variant, which came as a blessing for all the people. So when you look at the cumulative number of cases, Uganda has now about 163,446 cases, with a cumulative number of around 197 deaths. About 35 people are the ones who are admitted right now or the people who are in hospitals; that includes people who are in ICU and people who have some moderate signs and symptoms. So, this is exciting because we have over 35 treatment centers across the whole country, so if that is the case, it means some treatment centers are empty as I’m talking right now. When it comes to vaccination, Uganda has administered around 16,672,943 vaccines, so that includes the people who have received the first and second doses; the people who have completed all the doses are about 7 million. Thank you very much for watching today’s updates. See you in the next video. Bye. Excellent, thank you, Rafael. Great report as always. A quarter of a million deaths in Africa—it could have been so much worse, really. I’d expected it to be many more than that, so it’s terrible, but I’m really quite relieved that it wasn’t in the many, many millions. Cases in Uganda: 15, 0.6% positivity rate. Everything’s fully open; everyone’s completely back to normal. Interesting statement, though, with we thank God for Omicron. Interesting statement. I’ll leave you to make what you will of that. If you’re a theist, then you can thank God for Omicron; if you’re not, then you can decide whether Omicron has been remarkably fortuitous or not. In all of Uganda, 35 people are in hospital despite very, very low vaccination rates, so it looks like the immunity, which is so obviously now being enjoyed in Uganda, is primarily as a result of natural exposure, and Omicron just seems to have sort of finished that job off fairly nicely. I would be optimistic, given that things have gone so well in Uganda. It will be interesting to see what happens; presumably there’s going to be a period of endemicity. It’s not going to go away completely, but that will be interesting to follow. So, it looks like they’re well into their endemic phase now, whereas we’re just sort of entering into that more slowly or with a delay in our highly vaccinated Western cultures. Okay, so dodgy withdrawn abstract, therefore anything I said about that is wrong, and this was a simple mistake that I made. So hopefully that’s clarified, and all doctors, nurses, and practitioners now know to look out for all of these potential side effects. Let’s hope that is the case, although I am not entirely sure it is. Thank you for watching."
Vaccine side effects censorship drove vaccine hesitancy: nurse | Cuomo,NewsNation,2024-05-03,KKo6m6NmZeM,"Why do you believe it's the vaccine? And what has happened when you've tried to get a clinical analysis of it or answers? So let me tell you, let me first thank you for having the courage to bring this out, this topic out. I've waited three years for this moment. So this is really important to me and thousands of other people just like me. Why do I believe this? It's not a belief, it's a fact. And as soon as I was injured within 15, 20 minutes, in my first dose, I had parastegias with numbness tingling up and down my injected arm that overday spread to my face and my eyes. I went to see a neurologist, he ran some tests, he's like, well, this is all new, we don't know much about it, but the hospital is going to mandate it. You should get a second dose. And everything in my medical mind and my in my bones was telling me no. If you have a reaction after something, don't do it again. But the pressure was immense and then three weeks rolled around, I got a second dose and after that everything blew up. I went from being a healthy, 100 percent healthy, fully functioning nurse to in a complete downward spiral of health. I had a myriad of symptoms. And in the succeeding years, have you gotten any clarity from doctors that, yeah, we are seeing this or from the drug manufacturer putting out any information about what could happen as a side effect? No, as a research nurse practitioner and somebody who worked on vaccine research, I thought after I was injured, there would be people to help me. I'm like, I'm in New York City, I will have the, there will be medical people ready to help me. There must be interest to find out what happened or what went wrong in with me. I reached out to my political representatives, I reached out to the NIH, the CDC, the FDA, I got no answers, no one wanted to touch it. I got token responses back or no response. So I went on a mission to research myself and help others. What have you found out and what do you see in your blood work? I sent in the early days when I couldn't get answers here at home in America, I sent my blood over to Germany. And I had help with connecting with German sciences. They were more interested to help me than people here in my own country. It's less political there. And that testing showed I developed several auto-anibodies, many of them that some theorists or some scientists believe are attributed to this pot, sort of a positional techic party that you mentioned, where every time I stand my heart zooms. So some of my auto-anibodies look similar to people with long COVID. And I never had COVID. And that was proven through his immunological studies of my blood. They could not find any viral antibodies. We don't even really have an official finding on long COVID. And I know that's weird because I say that I have long COVID, but I only say that I have long COVID because the doctors who are treating me are calling it long COVID. And they say that they're not getting a whole lot of support from the government, because even though we are spending a lot of money in the U.S. on a specific effort to research long COVID, they take a long time. And I think there's really no incentive to get out in front of this because it's just bad PR. I mean, nobody's going to get padded on the back for saying, yeah, Sean's right. There's their side effects on some of the vaccines or all of the vaccines that we should be talking about and figuring out a treat. And there is long COVID and there's lots. Nobody wants to say that because it's all political now. Right. And we're caught in the crosshairs of the politics. Where, you know, I thought that all my pro vaccine colleagues would, you know, that champion we on would be there to lift me up and help me. And in fact, there are ones who turned around dismissed tonight and tried to censor and bury me. What do they think you're chasing money? I think that it's just the taboo around, like you said, about vaccines. They're afraid that by showing my face, I'll drive vaccine hesitancy. But what they don't realize and what I have come to realize is that the censorship and the hiding of it is actually fueling vaccine hesitancy. If the government had just said, hey, these are novel vaccines. We don't, you know, there will be reactions. Let's just have a program in place to deal with them. Right. Set up the fund to obligate the manufacturers to provide help or research. I think people, the citizens would have appreciated that. Hey, thank you for watching.

Moderna paid 400 million to NIH,Dr. John Campbell,2023-08-18,dvUa-wgPOJs,"Well, one welcome to today's talk. It's Friday the 18th of August. Now, today I want to play you a clip from the Senate Health, Labour and Pensions Committee hearing. Let's just have a brief look at this now. It basically features Senator Rand Paul. And he's in conversation with the Moderna Chief Executive Officer, Stefan Banshel. Now, one question that came up here is really quite interesting. Moderna paid the National Institutes of Health, $400 million. $400 million. So we've got people that were actually receiving $400 million involved in the decision making for who gets vaccines that, of course, they have to buy from Moderna. Quite interesting. I'll leave you to watch this clip now. Do stick around it only lasts for about four minutes. Mr. Banshel, Moderna recently paid NIH $400 million. Do you believe it creates a conflict of interest for the government employees who are making money now off of the vaccine to also be dictating the policy about how many times we have to take the vaccine? Good morning, Senator. Indeed, we recently made a before Christmas last year, a 400 million dollar payment to VNH. For an old patent that they are developed not related to COVID, but useful in the development of a COVID vaccine to prevent overwork. It's for the US government to assess how that money should be. Do you think it creates a conflict of interest for the same people deciding the policy of how often we have to take the vaccine to also be making money the more times we take the vaccine? Yes or no? This is for the government to decide. No opinion on whether or not it creates a conflict of interest. Is there a higher incidence of myocarditis among adolescent males 16 to 24 after taking your vaccine? Thank you for the questions. First, let me say we can deeply build safety and we are working closely with CDC and the FDA to be able to. Yes or no? Is there a higher incidence of myocarditis among boys 16 to 24 after they take your vaccine? I've seen sorry from the CDC. Actually, I've seen that there is less myocarditis for people who get the vaccine, because they get COVID infection. You're saying that for ages 16 to 24 among males who take the COVID vaccine, their risk of myocarditis is less than people get the disease? That is not true. I'd like to enter into the record six peer-reviewed papers from the Journal of Vaccine, the Annals of Medicine, to say the complete opposite of what you say. I also spoke with your president just last week and he readily acknowledged in private that yes, there is increased risk of myocarditis. The fact that you can't say in public is quite disturbing. Do you think it scientifically sound to mandate three vaccines for adolescent boys? This is probably probably the leaders to decide. You've been advocating for it. You've been interviewed and you've been advocating for boosters. Do you know when the myocarditis is most common among these adolescent boys after the second dose? When I spoke with your president, he readily acknowledged in private yet that maybe there ought to be a discussion whether we ought to have one vaccine versus two versus three. If 90 percent of the myocarditis comes after the second dose, why don't we have a rational discussion about one? Marty McCarry, a physician from Johns Hopkins, has said exactly the same thing. It's been discussed and yet we have this ridiculous notion from the CDC. So the CDC says, and I'll ask you this question. Let's start it as a question. Your 16-year-olds had COVID. Your 16-year-old gets better and now has recovered from COVID. You vaccinate them and they get myocarditis. Are you going to give them two more vaccines? Your child, give them two more vaccines? I'm not the clinician. I will have to discuss. You have children. Have you vaccinated your children? I have. How many times? Three or four times. Three or four times. So the CDC recommends this and you know, you're obviously someone who's self-interested in the outcome here. But the CDC says that if your 15-16-year-old gets COVID, recovers, takes a vaccine and gets myocarditis is hospitalized with elevated heart enzymes and is very sick. The CDC says, as soon as he gets better of vaccine anymore again, you know how many American parents think that that's a rational, reasonable thing to do? Do you know how many countries don't do this for children? Sweden doesn't offer the vaccine for kids under 12 unless they're at risk for severe disease. And I agree with that. I'm not saying never on any of this. I think it's a very reasonable position to say kids at risk or have some diseases that there may be a reason for vaccinating some children. Finland doesn't recommend it for under 12 months nor away also. England as well. France, Poland, Germany, Switzerland and all of vaccinate 12 and up. So we got half the world who have looked at these studies. There's a study in Israel of thousands of patients and yet you sit here and act as if you've never heard of myocarditis and you don't think it's an increased risk for young adolescent males when all of the studies who isolate out people by age have found that yes, there's an increased risk after taking your vaccine. Fies are two but worse with Moderna. There's an increased risk and I was comparing it to somebody who gets COVID. Well, that's also not true either but there's an increased risk of getting it but even when they compare it to the disease there are many papers out there who do that do show that there's more for risk of myocarditis after vaccination. So you have to weigh the risk and balances and you are right you're going to make less money because you're going to try and they're already trying CDC's got it on their schedule. They're going to try to force all the kids in America to do this to school. But guess what? Parents aren't going to do it. They've seen that COVID is not deadly in children and you're right. It's become less deadly over time. Your market's going down. So you aren't going to make as much money. I'm all for you making money in an honest way. But I don't like the idea that the people making decisions in government are also receiving money and are now conflicted in their interest. Well, that was pretty interesting wasn't it? So Senator Rand Paul perhaps a little cynically thinking that a mere matter of $400 million might influence decision making but of course the chief executive officer of Pfizer has no view on that whatsoever. Let's go on and look at the myocarditis as well and see how this has changed the has this changed the advice from the CDC on vaccinating adolescent boys and young men. Really quite incredible in my country the winter vaccination campaign starting in autumn is only going to be for the over 65s. Yeah, in America, they're still advising vaccines for children and young adolescent men and young men who are we know at most risk of myocarditis. Absolutely incredible. So that's the bit about making money that could raise a conflict of interest. Now when these people say thank you for the question, Senator, it means that it means that I'll let you decide what that means. 16 to 24 year old increased myocarditis after the second dose and the idea that you would actually well, the first of all that seems to be two different things going on here. We've got the I spoke with you president just last week and he readily acknowledges in private that yes, there's an increased risk of myocarditis. But that's not really being admitted publicly quite what is going on here is not it's it's yeah, I think you sense my frustration. And the idea there that Senator Paul was talking about that someone would have covered actually have the disease and have natural immunity of course. Then have the vaccine have myocarditis then go on to further vaccinations after myocarditis to me is just completely unconscionable. If someone has a side effect from one drug you do not unless a consultant specifically orders it give that drug again it's just so fundamental as to what you don't do in health care. Quite incredible. Let's look at the latest guidelines from the CDC FDA. So we can see families that have vaccinated are clearly happy and healthy. Now some of you might think that's rather crew pop again but this is what the FDA put out the food and drug administration put out on Twitter. Now the guidelines here six months to five years of age still advising two doses of vaccine. Two doses dose one dose now dose two at least four to eight weeks after dose one. That's up to five years of age so from six months to five years of age they're advising this quite incredible. Six years and older again still advising two doses and of course this is not split into different population types this is still for boys and young adolescent men and young men are still being advised the same way as 85 year old women it's just. Quite incredible really the governing bodies in the United States thinking this way or lack of thinking this way and they also want you to keep up to date so this is from the CDC website today. Step today with covid 19 vaccine what you need to know everyone age six years and older should get one updated fires a bio and tech or Moderna covid 19 vaccine to stay up to date and of course that is not differentiated into into age groups. So I'll leave you to decide who came off best between that exchange between Rand Paul and the chief executive officer but it's looking more and more farcical in my view you'll have your own views I won't I'll let you make up your own mind on just what is going on. But for today thank you for watching."
Unfiltered | Is government ignoring Covid-19 vaccination side effects? 06 February 23,SABC News,2023-02-07,DvKNQxAp_Zg,"This South African government is forging ahead with its vaccination program. This despite the report of potential adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccination in South Africa, in other parts of the world as well. But this could be interrupted as three NGOs have approached the Pretoria High Court to force the state to stop the vaccinations. COVID-19 care alliance, transformative health, justice and free the children safe and free the children safe. The nation claimed that the COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous and harmful. Good evening and welcome to unfiltered with me Aldrin Sampier. So government is continuing with its booster shots campaign. Tonight we interrogate this in this discussion with the professor of vaccinology, professor Shabir Madhu, who is joining us in studio. You also welcome Professor Alapena Rappiti, who is one of the experts in the Stop the Shots campaign court case, as well as Dr. Susan Foslow, who is a cardiac surgeon and advisor of the SAV-AERS. We also invited the department of health and they have unfortunately declined to participate and saying that there is a case before the courts tonight. On unfiltered we ask is government ignoring the side effects of COVID-19 vaccinations, some of which are life threatening. Remember that you can be part of this discussion using our Twitter handle that is at unfiltered SBC and on Facebook just search for unfiltered SBC. Before we continue let's take a look at this in documenting what some people say they've experienced and they've developed illnesses due to COVID-19 jabs put together by our producer Gino Siguen. When 31-year-old Amariska Ogers made the decision to take the COVID-19 vaccine, she says it was out of her wish to protect her elderly mother who is suffering from secondary Parkinson's disease but she says little did she know that she would suffer the devastating impact of the vaccine side effects. Now she's battling Gilean Barri syndrome, a condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves which she believes was caused by the COVID-19 vaccine she took. Within one hour after receiving the vaccine I became very ill, kept on getting pens and needles in my feet, in my hands and even in my nose I felt very like I wanted to collapse and I felt tired, I felt depleted. Like I said keep saying to my mom there's something wrong, something is not right until eventually on the 3rd of January where I completely became paralyzed. Amariska says her life as she knew it has been completely destroyed. I'm stuck here in this house basically because it's difficult to manage to get me down there and to get me somewhere and people need to really think carefully about this whole situation and how it affects their life because this is not easy, the effect that it does at my dad and my mom as parents. Similarly, 58 year old Aghavwa Williams-Heran Dean says she had considered herself a healthy and fit person before taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Now she says she's suffering from an array of elements she never had before. Aghavwa says shopping at a local supermarket and activity she's done with ease for years has become difficult as she often gets confused. At our local spa everyone knows that if they see me standing they need to go and ask me did you forget or do you still know where you live? Can we take you home? Because often I'm out I have no idea where I live. It's very difficult to explain. She wants government to acknowledge people like herself who are suffering from adverse vaccine-side effects and intervene in their situations. I need to be acknowledged as having an illness as the National Health Service in Britain are now acknowledging people. I'm sure our government are very aware of best practice globally as the NIC of America is doing as the Canadian Health Service is doing as Canada is doing to acknowledge that there is an issue. Gino-Sikwina unfurled SBC. Well thank you so much that report they put together by Gino-Sikwina. Professor Madi let's start off the conversation with you joining us in studio. Does that insert surprise you at all? And of course this is the perspective of people who believe that they've got adverse effects because of the COVID-19 vaccine. So the sensors don't surprise me. I mean there's a category of individuals that would make claims irrespective of whether it's based in science or not. So let's just unpack what it's doing the visuals said. The first case was a case that claims they have a GILEN-BAR syndrome which is the recognized complication of vaccines of COVID-19 vaccines as well as influenza vaccines for that matter. With COVID-19 vaccines the incidence of developing GILEN-BAR syndrome is in a region of about one out of every 500,000 people that are vaccinated. Now globally to date the number of people that have been vaccinated with COVID-19 is sitting at about 5.5 billion people, three quarters of the world's population. There's been closer to 13 billion doses of vaccine that have been administered. How many people do you know in South Africa that have got GILEN-BAR syndrome and are answered to react to be zero. The second individual who claims confusion to be a side effect of vaccine she spoke very eloquently and quite eloquently for someone that has this mental challenge because of vaccination. Obviously what's lacking there is information in terms of when the onset of the confusion was and even for the first case it's extremely unusual. For someone to start manifesting the sort of neurological symptoms as the individual indicated within one hour of being vaccinated. GILEN-BAR syndrome when caused by vaccines is because of sort of an autoimmune reaction to different to the nerves of the body. It's something that actually gradually occurs. After how long? Well usually we expect it to occur within 42 days of a person being vaccinated if it occurs beyond 42 days extremely unlikely to be. Do you know what triggers that? Well like I said it's an autoimmune type of reaction and it's not only caused by vaccines, it's caused by it's thought to be caused by viruses as well. In fact the majority of GILEN-BAR syndrome we can't actually identify what the cause of it is. So it's not to say GILEN-BAR syndrome only occurs in people that are vaccinated, it occurs in the general population. Does it heighten it at all? Well it does but again you need to put it in a context of what the risk is in relation to the number of people that are vaccinated. So if you got one event for every half a million people that are vaccinated it's a nominal risk compared to the number of lives that will be safe when people are vaccinated. GILEN-BAR syndrome. Dr. Foslo you heard that incident that we played there but earlier on I want to know from the VAER as a side at least some of the data that you've been able to extrapolate so far. Thank you thank you Aldrin. I am in the background in an advisory capacity with SAVAERs. There is an organization in the United States. It's known as VAERs. It's vaccine adverse events register and I think the information on that's really well known. It's been analyzed from many different angles. I think what I really find not comforting is the dismissal of people that do feel that they had been harmed and I do as a practicing clinical physician that the interest of the patient comes first and whether the patient's correct or not it is worth looking into this event and not just dismissing it outright as an unscientific experience. I think Dr. Rappiti who has a clinical practice on the ground would be in a better position to make this more clear. Okay Dr. Rappiti over to you. Yeah first of all I want to say to you that I've treated over 3000 patients. I've not seen one complication with the COVID virus. It is not true that we do not have any Gila in bar. First of all I've seen three patients thus far. There's an under-reporting fact of over 43 in the the FDA has shown in 2011 the under-reporting fact is almost 90 percent. There's not entirely two because we don't see the figures they do not exist. It is the tedious process to get this across. So I alone have seen three. Today I've seen one patient with Gila in bar. It is not true that Amariska did not have Gila in bar because she had symptoms on the first day. You must have this kind of vaccine. It's a toxic protein. It can affect any organ and in an effect to in a variety of ways. It's the details of this. But Amariska really devout a weakness within about 30 to 40 days and you get the Caucasian type way from the lower limbs. But in this particular type where the COVID vaccine is or bio weapon is concerned. It affected her in very bizarre positions in the nose and then later on she got weakness and instead of you went along that way and the Somali is correct that it is an autoimmune disease. There are no real blood tests or investigations. It's a clinical diagnosis and there are only two things. If you search the literature that is caused either by a virus or a vaccine and yet the difference to be made is that you do special testing of the antibodies to see whether it was caused by the virus or the vaccine. Now with a virus you would have a nuclear-capsid antibody and you would have the spike protein. But where is if it is entirely due to a vaccine you would only see the spike protein antibody. So in Amariska's case she did not have a viral infection at the time when she got the Gila in bar syndrome. It was only when she was totally paralyzed. It was a rapid thing. It happened very fast and when she was admitted into hospital or we could too later she acquired an infection. So use one thing. She's taking a vaccine to protect her and within about three months she now gets and she gets Gila in bar full blown within about a month or so and within three months and when she is admitted she ends up getting an infection proving that the vaccine doesn't work be it gives her infection. So I don't buy that you know that there's been one in 500,000 I like to see where the evidence because if you look at the way the vaccine operates and the way the virus operates are two different things. The vaccine has got a nipid nanoparticle. They've done studies on rats under the request by the Japanese company on Pfizer to show how far does your vaccine go and they found that it appears in every organ of the body within about 16 to 24 hours and it remained there for 48 for 16 days and ordinarily an M-Orne protein should be destroyed within two days and it does not remain in the deltoid muscle. This vaccine is new technology it has been untested. Pfizer has been very condiving unfair dishonest in the way they conducted their studies. There's a lady called Brook Chanson who saw terrible irregularities. The dosages weren't correct. So now I don't agree that there's no gillain bar syndrome and that the lady didn't have gillain bar. It's a clinical diagnosis. She has all the manifestations of gillain bar. Thank you. So when we come back we'll deal with that question around the claim around the toxicity of this vaccine and also another claim is that the vaccine doesn't work and the data that we have received from the CDC as we feel even if you look here in South Africa as well the information coming from the Department of Health and that's part of their campaign now as well is that the vaccines actually do work and they do prevent severe side effects as well as hospitalization. The conversation when we come back. And welcome back as we continue this conversation as we have this conversation with the professor Shapiro Maddie who's joining us in studio. Vex analogous, professor, you want to quickly respond to Dr. Rapiti there? Yeah so I think there's a few issues and I'm not going to take time to unpack all of the misinformation but firstly it's not the toxic protein that's being injected in South Africa. I think Dr. Rapiti has got his vaccines incorrect. The protein based vaccines have never been used in South Africa. It's a messenger RNA vaccines. In addition to gillain bar is actually not just a clinical diagnosis. You can actually do it as you do what you call an EEG. I spent the first 10 years of my life after being qualified as a pediatrician in ICU at Crosanibariguanan hospital. When Dr. Rapiti says that a person develops an infection in hospital and the vaccine didn't protect their individual. Yes the person probably did develop an infection in hospital but that's the hospital acquired infection. It's got nothing to do with COVID-19. People that developed gillain bar syndrome especially then ICU that high risk of acquiring bugs from the ICU which causes them to get an infection. That's got nothing to do with a COVID-19 vaccine resulting in an individual getting infected. To COVID-19 vaccines work short-term says they do. I've told COVID-19 vaccines a tool of bio terrorism. Right now that means that's 5.5 billion people. They have been infected and they were dying according to Dr. Rapiti. When does he agree with Dr. Rapiti about the MRNA being a new technology and therefore? No actually not. The messenger RNA in the field of vaccines is relatively new technology. Messenger RNA technology itself has been in existence for one and a decade. In fact it's actually being pioneered in the field of treatment for cancers. So messenger RNA is a technology is not something that's new but in the field of vaccines is the first time that we've used it to actually deal with the infection. So this is part of a trial which we agree? Well it was part of a trial when we did initial clinical trials. Now it's no longer part of a trial. This messenger RNA vaccines are now licensed in the United States. The license in most of Europe in the United Kingdom. They now form part of the DNA of vaccines. One of four different types of vaccines that we've got available to us. Dr. Rapiti I see you there shaking your head. You're absolutely because when we talk of infection it was tested in the hospital that Amariska got COVID. So there's no quarry about what infections you got. And as for it being safe and effective let me give you some figures. That this COVID vaccine was tried in ferrets, 200 ferrets and shortly after they were exposed to this vaccine they all died. 100 percent dead. They tried it in Indonesia for a dengue fever. And when they re expose these children to it 40 percent of them died. So it was it's not that it's untested and untried. It's not fully explored because Pfizer has not been fair in terms of if you take the latest vaccine the by-valid vaccine they only tried it on eight people. This did not go the proper studies. In fact the Pfizer director himself in the EU it was the EU presentation. She was questioned by the parliamentarians. Did Pfizer test vaccine for transference? They said frankly this was at warp speed we did not do it. So it's coming from the horses. They did not do any testing about it. In terms of its safety I can tell you I worked with the Delta strain. At that time there was a huge reinfection with the Delta strain among the WVACs that are in places like Gibraltar and Singapore proving that it was 80 percent ineffective. Right now at the moment I can give you the figures that 85 percent of the people that are getting infected or dying in Japan are the triple boosted because there's a thing called and Professor Marty will be an expert on this. There's a thing called vaccine fatigue. What happens is you have three to four times of IGG IGG123 and four. Your four is at least effective and what they've now found in the study is that with infections your IG one is the prominent and potent one but with the vaccine they found that there's a prominence of IG4. So you find from the Office of National Statistics we don't do statistics in this country. You cannot report when you have an adverse event. It's such a tedious job so we got our own wares but the Office of National Statistics are showing that people who have been triple boosted have been 80 percent accounting for the number of infections. So in order to say the vaccine we've got today which was actually created for the alpha and the one strain with ineffective against the Delta strain and now totally ineffective against a multi mutant Omicron strain that makes no sense because if it was if the this Pfizer vaccine was effective why on earth with Pfizer go ahead and create the bivailant vaccine which was not properly tested not effective and the other thing is that you do not vaccinate when you have an 100 percent recovery the Omicron 5 is and is variant not even variant it's it's a variant of Omicron 5. It's got almost zero fatality and talking from the the the mouths and minds of Michael Yeeden who is an immunologist Robert Clancy, Immurators Professor on Immunology they come out very clear that artificial immunity cannot and will not compare with natural immunity and we've seen this we've seen it South Africa as well okay can I just quickly go to Dr. Foslo just try to get Dr. Foslo into the conversation as well Dr. Foslo on what basis and what evidence which you be relying on for call to stop the vaccine campaign that is currently underway and until when I think the the point of this case that Dr. Repetius also part of but I can summarize it briefly that worldwide this been now three years of of statistics and they said a very concerning sign all across the world in Australia Europe UK Scotland and the United States of an existing this in comparison to baseline existing and those figures are widely available that come from formal government statistics and what it basically shows is that up to 2019 there's an average of deaths per year in 2020 in many countries the the average of deaths was lower than in the average of five years before and since 2021 these numbers have been increasing and are still increasing age group is it and does that does that apply to South Africa at all I was coming here okay were you interrupted me so the age group that is the least grown to to die with a natural so-called COVID infection is the younger age group and the existing seem to be far higher in age groups for instance from about 16 to 49 years I think that's highly worrying and a does need investigation I think what this court case aims to achieve as to say let's pause and review the data I don't think chanting safe and effective or the marketing narrative of the companies that manufacture these products is really open to society does does the analogy around the excess deaths applied to South Africa at all they are they are no statistics so I think I think it's also going to be difficult to do it is the statistics that are released yes let me talk to Foslo so the African-American research council has been tracking excess mortality since the start of the pandemic they stopped doing that recently because it was no longer any excess mortality Dr. Foslo has got the facts incorrect the COVID-19 vaccines haven't been around for three years they've only been around for two years the excess mortality actually cracked the waves of COVID-19 that occurred in South Africa and the same goes elsewhere currently there isn't any excess mortality in South Africa and certainly no excess mortality in the United Kingdom United States so Dr. Foslo and what do you base those stats on well based on the published data from the series CDC itself based on the published data from the United Kingdom okay we continue the conversation when we come back and also getting some closing remarks from my panel and let me just quickly get some closing remarks from my guest this evening Dr. Foslo I'm going to start off with you 30 seconds closing remarks please I think another serious concerning aspect is the harassment and censorship of any distinct voices and persecution and at oboyominium attacks on medical professionals that rise certain concerns thank you so much Dr. Rapiti your 30 seconds yeah I just want to make it quite clear that Dr. Maldi is not correct that there is no excess deaths in Japan alone in 2021 there was 22,000 excess deaths in 2022 it was 82,000 please I'll send you the information Dr. Maldi I think you're needing to inform this country correctly this vaccine is not needed it's toxic it's irrelevant and we've got a very good virus that's safe as well Dr. Maldi he's not a clinician he doesn't understand the science Dr. Maldi quickly you are 30 seconds yeah my petition that worked in is a nice UIMer clinician short answer five and a half billion people have been vaccinated 12.7 billion doses of vaccine have been administered in the first year vaccines used alone 20 million lives have been saved let a date and let a fixed peak for yourself thank you so much unfortunately we have ran out of time and thank you so much for joining us this evening on S3 unfiltered with me Alder and Simpier enjoy the rest of the evening that's it doctor"
Covid Vaccine after Having Covid: Symptoms and Side Effects,Tim Fraticelli - PTProgress,2021-04-13,cNl_vW_yV5Q,"Hey guys, it's Tim with PT Progress and in today's video we're talking about the COVID vaccine and the side effects that I experienced after having COVID then getting the vaccine about two and a half months later. Now I'm a physical therapist, I'm not an immunologist or an infectious disease physician and I'm definitely not your physician or healthcare provider. This is just my experience as someone who has had COVID-19 then received the vaccine two and a half months later. Now I was hesitant at first about getting the vaccine because like a lot of people I contracted COVID back in December. There were a ton of questions about how long you should wait until getting the vaccine after you've been infected, how long the antibodies would work to keep you protected against another COVID infection and so on. Because the last thing I wanted to do was to get COVID again so I did some research and originally the CDC recommended waiting 90 days to get the COVID vaccine if you already had COVID. That suggestion changed so now as long as you are out of isolation you're no longer contagious and you're clinically recovered from COVID-19. It's recommended that you're vaccinated. Now for some people that may be as little as one month after having contracted COVID. Personally I had my vaccine just two a little over two months after recovering from COVID and I know this is a big point of contention whether or not you even need the vaccine after contracting COVID and I really want to hear what you think. It's a good question. Let me know in the comments. My goal here is not to convince you one way or the other but I do want to share my symptoms that I had after getting the COVID vaccine. Now if you've never had COVID your first dose of the vaccine may not produce any symptoms at all besides some soreness at the injection site and it's usually not until that second vaccine that you'll have some symptoms because your body recognizes the protein that should not be there and it recruits those newly built T lymphocytes and antibodies as a response to fight which is why you might feel some of those symptoms. You might feel a slight fever or get a headache, you'll nauseous or just feel really tired and fatigued or have some muscle soreness in your arm or throughout your entire body. But if you had COVID-19 already like I did you'll likely feel these symptoms with your first shot and that's because your body has already had a natural response when you had COVID initially. So the virus fighting cells are already in place to combat that recognized protein in the vaccine which will help to prompt that type of typical response of a slight fever or headache or muscle aches and fatigue and that's exactly how I felt with both doses of the Moderna vaccine and the symptoms they lasted for about two days each time. Personally I chose to get the vaccine on a Friday because I thought it would cause me to feel fatigued with muscle aches and soreness and sure enough it did. It did that for about two days but by Monday I was back at work in the clinic and I didn't have any symptoms or side effects after that. Now at the second shot that was absolutely identical for me in terms of symptoms and after looking into the research even more I think it would have been really nice to have that opportunity to get the single dose COVID vaccine if that was available at the time because there is some research out there showing that if you already had COVID-19 one vaccine dose it may be good enough in terms of developing a strong number of antibodies to help fight against future infection. Now there is no formal statement by the CDC regarding a one-dose treatment for people who were previously infected with COVID-19 but if I had to have a choice today I would prefer to get the one-dose vaccine so that I didn't have to experience an extra weekend of being fatigued with annoying muscle aches and so that the two dose vaccine could reach those folks who needed it most but honestly after having the second dose of the vaccine the worst part was just some muscle soreness and feeling tired all weekend just for a couple of days. And again I'm just sharing my experience here with the vaccine and the symptoms that I had as someone who's had COVID and then also experienced the light side effects that you hear about in terms of the vaccine it's really not that bad for the muscle aches I took some adbil and then I used a massage gun to work out the soreness I made sure to move around often and then to drink plenty of water and thankfully none of the side effects are loss of smell or taste like it is with the actual virus for many people I did recover my sense of smell and taste which you can learn more about in that video right here but I am curious let me know what your thoughts are do you plan on getting the vaccine let me know in the comments and if you found this video to be helpful let me know by hitting that like button and consider subscribing to the channel thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video"
"Covid vaccine side-effects can't be ruled out: Indian govt, after UK advisory",Hindustan Times,2020-12-15,Lwi0nKxtQGA,"When we talk about Universal Immunization, there are certain practical challenges that appear, especially in children and pregnant women, after the introduction of the vaccine. For example, the Jet Ask Edwards event falling under immunization is a practical challenge or a barrier to Universal Immunization. It is important for us to address these issues and provide solutions to overcome these barriers to ensure the effectiveness of immunization programs. So, to deal with these challenges, we need to be informed about the various aspects of vaccine administration and the potential obstacles we might face. Regular updates and discussions can help in finding effective strategies to improve the success of Universal Immunization efforts."
"Vaccination v excess deaths, correlation study",Dr. John Campbell,2023-03-21,iyo2UNQcdpQ,"Welcome to this talk. It's Wednesday the 22nd of March. Now, today I'm going to be looking at a paper and this is the paper here I want to look at. Is there a link between the 2021 COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Europe and 2022 all cause mortality, not COVID mortality, all cause mortality. And this study did find such a correlation. Now, let's look at it now. This is the question. That's the paper. Now, this is studied in this is paper. The paper is published in Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. Now, in Norway, they have certain freedoms that we don't have in Western countries. We don't have in the UK or the United States. For example, in Norway, you can actually camp anywhere. So there's certain freedoms in Norway that we don't have in other countries. Anyway, getting back to the topic in hand, conflict of interest statements. The authors declare no conflict of interest. So I think we can take it from this that the authors are not being paid huge amounts of money by vested interest, which of course is always good to check. So no vested interest there. The authors say we primarily study a possible link between 2021 COVID-19 vaccination uptake in Europe and all cause mortality in 2022. So the correlating vaccines in 2021 for COVID-19 and monthly mortality in 2022. Now, let's be perfectly clear. This is a preprint. This is not a peer reviewed paper. But I wanted to cover this paper because I think the possibility of this getting published in a mainstream peer review journal is essentially zero. Leave that there. I don't think it's going to get published in a peer review journal. If it does, I'll be very surprised and more certainly report on it. But I think it's important to report on it now because this is the whole point of preprints. They are papers for discussion and we're discussing it now. So IE mortality higher than before the pandemic. So this is taking the mortality in 2022 comparing that to pre-pandemic levels. Now the analyzed 31 countries January to September 2022. They did point out the importance of analyzing the last three months in 2022 when they get the full data available for that. This is just where that went up to. 31 EU member states throwing in Norway, Iceland, Lichensdain and Switzerland. All cause mortality. This is direct quote from the paper. Increased more the higher the 2021 vaccine uptake. In other words, countries with more COVID 19 vaccines in 2021 add higher excess mortality in the first nine months of 2022. This is what we call a positive correlation between vaccination in 2021 and excess deaths in 2022. And they quantify it. There was a 1 percent point increase in 2021 vaccination rate. So for every one point, every one percent that went up. Basically the mortality went up by a tenth of a percent. So the mortality in 2022 was 0.105, basically 10th of a percent. So I consider that number to be huge. 1 percent increase in vaccination in 2021. 1 percent increase in overall mortality in 2022. It's a huge number. Absolutely huge number. When controlling for alternative explanations, the association remained robust. So they remained robust and significant. Now 2021 or cause mortality was lower the higher the vaccination uptake. So interestingly in 2021, the more vaccines people had, the less people died in 2021. But in 2022, it was the opposite. But and it's a big but in 2021, when they controlled for other variables that became a non significant effect. So there was an inverse correlation between COVID vaccines and all cause mortality in 2021, but it was not significant after they accounted for quite a few variations that they cleverly accounted for in this paper. This is from data from Euro stat. We've looked at this many times. Official European statistics check it out for yourself. EU experience, success mortality in the first nine months of 2022. We've looked at that before. No question that that is the case, tragically. We're talking about mortality here as if it's some abstract concept of course. It's not it's multiple individual human tragedies and bereavements. This is why we do this. This is this is this is this is massive importance. COVID-19 vaccination has prevented SARS-CoV-2 related hospital blood missions and deaths. So there's evidence that in 2021, May 2021 and 13th of May, so these are both May 2021 and given that these papers were both published in May 2021, they're dealing with data from January, February, March, mostly 2021. Very early on in the pandemic, the alpha and delta stages of the pandemic. So evidence that the vaccine was effective from 2021 and 2021. That's from the Lancet, that's from British Medical Journal. So vaccines were preventing SARS-CoV-2 related hospital hospital admissions and deaths, specifically of course to SARS-CoV-2 not talking about law cause mortality. COVID-19 vaccination aside effects such as myocarditis and pericarditis says who? Don't take my word for things. Well, as always we give evidence. Evidence for myocarditis and pericarditis post-vaccine. This one's from the American Medical Association cardiology and note we're now into 2022. So this is a year later say this is six of a months later, 25th of January 2022. So we can clearly see that times have changed. A recent study falsified suspected association between the two diagnoses, that's myocarditis and pericarditis and COVID-19 virus infection. So Journal of Clinical Medicine, that's that publication there. They found post-COVID-19 infection was not associated with either myocarditis or pericarditis. So that makes us a bit curious about where the increase in myocarditis and pericarditis came from if it's not caused from the natural infection. Vaccine uptake is the percentage of the, this is how they got the data, vaccine update. They took us the, as the percentage of the total population that's received a primary course by week 52 of 2021. In other words, this only goes up to the end of 2021. Now here are the countries that are studied and these are the percentages of the primary courses. Now of course all of this is in the article. I just put this here to show you what a huge epidemiological study this actually is. So percentage of primary courses by the end of 2021. And that's what they took their correlations from. So low in Bulgaria going all the way up to Iceland and Ireland, 76.6 percent. Countries that you might be interested in, you can see there, of course, the UK no longer remember of the European Union. But we will be at the very much the higher end of this. And of course, of course the account of population size needless to say. Their conclusion here of direct work from the paper, the interaction between vaccine uptake and time passed in months since the beginning of 20, 22 is strongly significant and implies that the mortality increase and the higher the vaccine uptake. So implies that the mortality increases the higher the vaccine uptake. So the more people had vaccines in 2021. So that was vaccines in 2021. And this was increasing deaths in 2022. There is a positive correlation between the two. The higher the vaccination rate, the higher the deaths, the lower the vaccination rate in 2021, the lower the excess deaths. Now of course, these are correlations. So they rightly went on and looked at other things that could be causing this. Potential reverse causality they looked at. Could it be the excess mortality that was causing the vaccinations? Well, they eliminated that because of course the excess mortality came after the correlations and we know from the need for a temple correlations that the cause has to come before the effect. But anyway, they carried on concerning alternative explanations. We control for average or cause mortality in 2020 and 2021 by dividing the average between 2016 and 2019. So the mortality data they were taking was from before the pandemic. So that got rid of that variable. Relatively low mortality at one period is followed by relatively high mortality and later on, a vice versa. So in other words, what they're saying here is, well, if lots of people died in 2020, you'd expect or 2021, you'd expect, actually expect a few of people to die in 2022. And the exact opposite was the case. But they did mathematically account for that. So we know that it's not that is not the cause of the excess mortality. But even when they took account of this direct vote from the paper, we still observe a significant association between 2021 vaccination uptake and 2022 monthly increasing all cause mortality. Countries with higher vaccines in 2021 had a higher all cause mortality in 2022. Now they did as knowledge what's called the ecological fallacy. Now this would say that because the number is true of a nation, it's not necessarily true of individuals, which of course is true. And they acknowledge that. They acknowledge that. We are cautious about making individual level inferences from our nation level findings. So very honest of the researchers there. Now excess mortality caused by delayed medical treatment or diagnosis, which of course is the main reason given in the UK Parliament for the excess deaths. That it's caused by delays in medical treatment during the pandemic. And indeed the relative chaos and the NHS at the moment, which is true. But we cannot see that the issue, the issues have been more prevalent in high vaccine versus low vaccine countries. In other words, delay in healthcare is all over the place. All countries have delays in healthcare. But the correlation is still there when they looked at the when they looked at the countries when they looked at the vaccination rates. That one when they looked at that one, the correlation is still there. So they don't think it's caused by that. And they actually specify this. At i.e. we do not expect delayed diagnosis on medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. They substantially have have included admitted variable bias. So they don't think it's that. So there we have it. It's very clear that there's a positive correlation. It's in that paper there. The higher the the higher the vaccination rates were in 2021, the higher the excess mortality in 2022. So that's the end of this video. I've nothing more to say on that now. On a completely separate matter, I've been thinking of might might go to the states and take up some start playing basketball. Nothing dry. I'd probably just start with semi-pro and then build up. But I've been looking at the terminology. And apparently you have something called a slam dunk in basketball. And this is literally a goal scored in the basket by by putting the ball straight down into the loop with one's hand. So that's a slam dunk. The same point is a traditional basket, but just to show a force dominance and skill. So a slam dunk is something that is completely convincing. As I say, nothing to do with this today's talk, but I'll need to use the correct terminology for when I'm playing basketball in the states. So do look out for me. I'm quite optimistic about it. But for now, thank you for watching."
What Are the Long-term Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccine?,The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,2021-01-28,E1YRdE91x5Q,"Hi, my name is Paul Offit from the Vaccine Education Center. It is January 2021. And now in the midst of this pandemic and now with the advent of two new vaccines, so called messenger RNA vaccines for event SARS-CoV-2, people ask the reasonable question since this is a new strategy, a new way to make a vaccine, what are the long-term effects? How are we going to know about the long-term effects? Vaccines like any medical product that have a positive effect can have a negative effect. And that's true here too. So for example, vaccines like the oral polio vaccine was a rare cause of polio. It occurred in maybe one per 2.4 million people, but it was real. The yellow fever vaccine was a rare cause of something that had the fancy name viscerotropic disease, which was really basically a form of yellow fever. Again, it occurred in about one hundred million people. It was rare. It was real. There was a squalene adjuvanted influenza vaccine that was used in Europe. There was also a very rare cause of something called narcolepsy, which is a permanent disorder of wakefulness. And measles containing vaccine can cause a lowering of the platelet count, which can cause these sort of like broken blood vessels called petikeye. Again, it occurred in maybe one in 30,000 people, rare, but real. The good news about these terrible side effects is that they all occur within six weeks of a dose. That's why it is that the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, insisted that each of these vaccines be studied for at least two months after the last dose, knowing that there's not been a serious side effect in history that hasn't occurred within weeks of getting the dose, within six weeks of getting the dose. But although some of those effects are long term, like polio or narcolepsy, they're still picked up within six weeks. So I think in those pre-approval studies where the vaccines had been tested in tens of thousands of people, you could say with confidence that there wasn't at least a relatively uncommon, serious side effect. And now that the vaccine has been given to more than 10 million people, I think you can say with some confidence that there doesn't appear to be right now a very rare serious side effect that would be something that would cause a long term problem. But again, we need to be humble, keep our eyes open and look what happens as we vaccinate hundreds and hundreds of millions of people to make sure that there's not an additional problem. But usually when those problems occur, they occur within six weeks of a dose. Thank you."
"Corona Vaccine side effects | Heart Attack, Brain Stroke Latest Update|Siddharth Sir Nursing Utkarsh",Utkarsh Nursing Classes,2024-05-02,NIilCz9YzZs,"As you know, when the COVID vaccine was first introduced, it was initially administered to frontline workers. I’m reminding you of that period when the first priority for vaccination was given to frontline workers. The term 'frontline workers' refers to all those people who were directly exposed to COVID at the start. This included hospital staff, nursing staff, doctors, paramedics, laboratory workers, sweepers, police officers, army personnel, defense personnel, and all those who had postings during the COVID period. These individuals were given the first priority for vaccination. After they were vaccinated, the next priority was given to people over 65 years old. I remember that during the phase for those above 65 years, there was a lot of news about people dying after receiving the vaccine, which caused fear among the elderly, and many of them refused to get vaccinated, fearing that the vaccine was causing deaths. The reason for these deaths was linked to existing conditions in older adults. Most elderly people already had atherosclerosis, which is the hardening of the arteries, and the vaccine exacerbated these conditions. It didn’t create new problems but rather worsened pre-existing ones. With age, the walls of blood vessels naturally become less resilient. In the elderly, if the blood vessels are already weakened, the vaccine could have exacerbated these issues. For those who had some underlying risk factors, the vaccine might have triggered a heart attack or other complications, leading to death. That’s why we heard stories of people dying soon after getting the vaccine, because their existing conditions worsened rapidly after vaccination. After the 65+ age group, the vaccination priority moved to people aged 45 years, then 30 years, and then 18 years. We saw that there were no reports of deaths among adults from the COVID vaccine because, unlike the elderly, adults generally did not have as many pre-existing risk factors. The vaccine did not cause deaths among adults because they did not have significant underlying issues. Everyone, including people in our country and around the world, had some risk factors, but the vaccine only posed risks to those with existing severe conditions. Therefore, it is rare to find an adult who died because of the COVID vaccine. The minor risks, like the formation of blood clots, were present but did not lead to death for most people. So overall, the COVID vaccine was effective in saving lives despite minor risks."
CDC Says Some Short-Term COVID Vaccine Side Effects Caused By Anxiety,CBS New York,2021-04-30,pErlLftu2vM,"The CDC says that some anxiety-related short-term side effects, some people experience after getting the coronavirus vaccine, can happen with any of the vaccines. And this includes fainting, dizziness, nausea, racing hearts, even chest pain. They add that fainting was more common after the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Health experts study dozens of people across five states who reported these reactions earlier this month. And they say the anxiety over getting the injections spurred these physical symptoms and was not caused by the shot itself."
Adverse vaccine events in 5 to 11 year olds,Dr. John Campbell,2022-07-21,uIFSvnB1WlQ,"I want to welcome to today's talk Thursday, the 21st of July now. The risk-benefit analysis of vaccination has changed in Omicron times. So today I want to look at a study from Singapore, over quarter of a million children. Now in this group of children, 22 of the children suffered a severe adverse reaction to the vaccination. But in the same time period, although there's quite a few children admitted to hospital, only five children needed oxygen. And of that, five only four were admitted to intensive care. So we've got five children needing vaccination out of this large group, but 22 children suffering a significant adverse reaction. And in fact, in those admitted to intensive care, there was actually more vaccinated, fully vaccinated, there was two and two intensive care from the fully vaccinated group, and only one from the unvaccinated group. Now it's not as simple as that, that's just the intro to this, but it shows that the risk-benefit analysis has changed. And of course this is talking about, who it's talking about, it's talking about this age group of children. So let's dive straight into this now. Now this is from the New England Journal of Medicine, so that's all absolutely fine. Fies of vaccine, published 20th of July, so published yesterday, so where you can't say, you're not up to date on this channel. Data on real world effectiveness of vaccine against Omicron in children is what they're looking at. January, so it's banging the middle of the Omicron period of time. Now this is part of the problem. So much of the evidence that we have is in previous ways, we're now in Omicron times, things have changed, and we need to move with the times to keep up to date with the evidence of the time. Some policies you might think are a little behind the times. So this is the time period we're looking at. Now 5 to 11 year old children, just over quarter a million of them. Now of that group, 67 percent fully vaccinated, there's the real numbers, 773,000 fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated 12 percent unvaccinated 20. 0.3 percent. Now what this means is there's a very good sum, these are very good numbers. Now this is all real data from the Singapore authorities, very good at collecting data in Singapore, very, very good at it, all anonymized. And so we have the basically the full data set to analyse. This is very good quality data that we are looking at. So they're the on vaccinated right. Now 16.417.9 million person days at risk. So what they did here was, it's a bit confusing, I don't particularly like it, it's what we've got. They looked at person days at risk in this age group. And the reason the numbers differ is because they stopped collecting hospitalisation data in early April. So the numbers are slightly different, but it's not enough to worry about. So we'll just look at the numbers as we're giving them directly in the paper. But it does mean the infection data, data and hospitalisation data is based on slightly different numbers, but that doesn't matter too much. Now, so during this period, during this period of time, they have 53,000 infections, just over 5,000 confirmed with PCR and 288 hospitalisations. Now, no one is trying to minimise 288 hospitalisations in this group of children. It's a lot, but remember only five needed oxygen. So a lot of being admitted on a precautionary basis, and we do this with children, we admit children much more readily than adults, at least I've always tended to do that because it's, we just don't take any chances with children, we were very, very careful with children. So there we have the, so 53,000 infections, good numbers, 288 hospitalised, that's right. So amongst hospitalised children, five received supplementary oxygen, very small number, four of whom were admitted to intensive care, of these five children, one was unvaccinated, two were partially vaccinated and two were fully vaccinated. Now to be fair, of course, there is more in the vaccinated group, but it does show that in terms of admission to intensive care, there's no evidence here that vaccination provides protection. There's no evidence that vaccination provides protection against oxygenation here. There's more data to come, but from that, that the most severe outcome, but all the time weighing this against the 22 severe adverse reactions, now we're not giving a lot of data, a lot of detail on the adverse reactions, but they do describe the missevere adverse reactions. So you see the balance, that the balance has changed because of Omicron. So that they were the ones admitted to intensive care. Now no deaths were attributed to recovered 19 in this age group, amongst children in the unvaccinated group. So this is the unvaccinated group. Now we see that there was 3,300 and three infections, 479 confirmed PCR tests and 30 hospitalisations compared to the unvaccinated group, and we can see that children in the fully vaccinated group were getting slightly fewer infections, less official diagnoses, and there were fewer of them admitted to hospital. But it's not so much the admissions to hospitals that might be considered the key thing, it's whether how sick those children are. And remember only five of the whole group required oxygen, oxygen therapy, a very small number. So I've just left those two metrics up there on the screen together, so we can see them together. So 30 hospitalisations in the group though, or unvaccinated, and 6.6 in the group that were vaccinated. Now we haven't finished yet, there's more to come on this. Vaccine efficacy against hospitalisation. So partly vaccinated versus unvaccinated children, we do see a level of efficacy, or reported infections 13.6 percent. PCR protection 24.3 percent, hospitalisations 42 percent protection. Fully vaccinated children, it goes up quite a bit. So these are children that had the two courses of vaccine. So we do see, we do see here, a significant protective effect in terms of being hospitalised in children that had had two doses of vaccine compared to children that had no doses of vaccine. But we don't see a difference in the children requiring oxygen, or the children getting very sick. So again, there's this risk benefit analysis to always be trying to weigh up here. But the other thing we'll look at in a minute is the fast degree of vaccine efficacy wearing. But let's go on, let's go through this data. So that was fully vaccinated children, we do see this protective effect. Now vaccine effectiveness against all confirmed infections. Fully vaccinated versus unvaccinated group at times after the second dose. So now we're comparing infections with fully vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Now the vaccine protection here we see 7 to 14 days, it's just under 50 percent protection against infection. What we're used to say is 48.9 percent efficacy of the vaccine. 15 to 29 days already, even after just over two weeks, down to 37.6 percent protection against infection. 30 to 59 days, not a long period of time, 28.5 percent down to just over a quarter, 25.6 percent after 60 days. And now that is all the data that we're given. So what we see here is even when the vaccine was at its most effective, we've got under a 50 percent efficacy. Of course at the very start of this, the WHO and all the experts were saying that if a vaccine was going to be any good, it would have to give us a 50 percent efficacy. And here we see it simple and not. And that's deteriorating rapidly over time. So the protection against infection is deteriorating rapidly over time. And we can't realistically, how can we continue vaccinating children on this sort of time scale. So very rapid reduction in vaccine efficacy. Now the conclusions, this is direct from the paper. During a period when the armacron variant was predominant, Pfizer vaccine reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-Niveis 2 infection. COVID-19 related hospitalizations amongst children 5 to 11 years of age, true, true. But it didn't reduce their chances of needing oxygen or their chances of being admitted to intensive care. There was no evidence for that, which is the most concerning outcomes of course. These findings suggest greater vaccine efficacy against higher levels of disease severity. So they are saying, let's be clear, that they are saying that the vaccine is providing some protection against higher levels of disease severity. They are saying that, but they don't appear to give data because there's only five children needing oxygenation, appear to give data to support that. So, but I'm not being cynical about these researchers. These are experts. It's a peer-reviewed paper. So, so there will be some reasons as to why they're saying that. The results of this study provide insight to enable decision makers to weigh the risk and the benefit against the potential risk. So the researchers are saying that this data here should be used and I would agree with this. This data here should be used by decision makers to weigh up the risk benefit analysis to decide if we should be vaccinating 5 to 11 year olds. Just to finish off though, among the one, there we go. So we need to add that in Singapore, as I said, 22 percent 22 sorry serious adverse events. That's not a point, not a 5 percent of all doses administered. That's not, let's cut to the quick here. It's 500,000. So the risk of adverse events is roughly a little more than four times greater than the risk of the child requiring oxygenation. Quite an interesting figure. The risk of adverse events is more than four times the risk of the child requiring oxygenation or indeed being admitted to intensive care. The risk benefit analysis has changed. So just to finish off, that's the actual slot there. So you can look at the reference yourself, the references, of course, given in the paper. So people are always asking me, should I get the vaccine? Should I vaccinate my child? Of course, I don't know you, I don't give medical advice, I can't possibly advise you on that. But here's a paper, look at it yourself, see if I've got this right, see if I've misinterpreted anything. But this is the way I read that paper. The risk benefit analysis has dramatically changed. 22 serious adverse events in children versus five requiring oxygen. Even though there is protection against hospitalisation overall. So they're the sort of numbers that parents can bear in mind policy makers, I think, really need to start reading this paper. Perhaps certain countries could be mentioned, maybe on the other side of the Atlantic, from where I live, that are advocating strongly, vaccinating in this age group of children and even younger children. Let's hope the policy makers are completely up to date with this data. And thank you for watching, of course. I think I'll just say something else before I finish. There's lots of things in the comments, people pretending to be me, giving you a text number, I won't give you a text number, asking, offering greater enlightenment, I certainly don't offer any enlightenment, that's for sure. And asking for money, which I will never do. So there's not a tick by the side of my picture, it's not for me, ignore it. And anything to do with crypto currents is nothing to do with me. It's just a pity the way spammers take over these things. So bear in mind, I won't put text numbers, I won't offer you greater personal enlightenment, I will not ask you certainly in the comments, never ask you for money, it's not me. So there we go and thank you for watching."
Is the severity of a COVID-19 vaccine's side effects an indicator of its effectiveness?,Global News,2021-06-30,_d54EBeVt-c,"As part of a study out of Sinai health, Amanda Ferguson has been monitoring her COVID-19 antibody levels post-vaccine. Because I have a compromised immune system, I wanted that sign that my body and my immune system was working. And other than a little bit of fatigue, I didn't really feel much. Living with Crohn's, that lack of symptoms after her first Pfizer shot had her worried she wasn't protected. Thankfully, her results provided good news. 16 days roughly passed the first shot, then you saw, oh my gosh, I'm protected and that it was such a relief. Doctors say normal reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine range from a little bit of soreness at the injection site to muscle aches, headaches and fever. For those lucky enough to have no symptoms, experts say there isn't cause for concern. We're all a little different and all our immune responses are a little different and we all have different sensitivities to the response. And while Earl Brown, a professor of virology at the University of Ottawa, agrees he notes immunity is linked to inflammation. We need a certain amount of it. You don't need enough to make you sick. And so you're not necessarily more immune if you're put in bed for a day. Brown also points out different vaccines can prompt different reactions. He says mRNA vaccines, for example, haven't been used in the past because they caused too much inflammation. That's been modified in the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. It is a dance when you're vaccinating, getting a vaccine which will stimulate your immune response sufficiently, but not excessively. For Ferguson, her second Pfizer vaccine left her with just a sore arm, she says. Again, she anxiously awaited her antibody levels. The results came back loud and clear that not only like I had a good amount after the first shot, but then I had a really good number after the second. That should give all healthy Canadians some peace of mind, peace of mind, and confidence to start a return to normal. Jamie Mural for Global News Toronto."
One in 35 myocardial injury,Dr. John Campbell,2023-07-26,cd_RTf_ForA,"Well, well, welcome to today's talk and I'm going to tell you what this is about so you can decide if you want to watch. It's Wednesday the 26th of July. Now if regulators around the world don't take notice of the information I'm about to give via this paper, then they are best in my view negligent, at worst but don't even want to think about it. After Moderna boosts the vaccines in a trial done in Switzerland, there were 777 working people followed up with 777 controls. 5.1 percent of those who had the booster vaccine had increased troponins indicating cardiomyocytes damage. So 5.1 percent increased cardiac marker damage chemicals in the blood. 2.8 percent of the 777 that is 1 in 35, 1 in 35 had vaccine associated myocardial injury. Quite astounding and incredible. That's what this is about if you want to watch stick around. I think I can get through it all in about sort of the main points in about 10 minutes if you want to stay. Just before we do that we'll just look at this advert from New Zealand. Now the advertisers in New Zealand say here we all need to do our part so vaccinate straight up to date and be an everyday hero and the pictures of these comic people here and that's sponsored by Pfizer BioNTech. Now the idea that there's all these comic people here I think is Marvel comics doesn't really grab me so I can only assume it's aimed at an audience shall we say younger than me. Some of you might consider that is quite outrageous and utterly unethical. Anyway let's get down to the business of today because this is really quite an impressive study by cardiologists and scientists in Switzerland. Myocardial injury after Covid-19 vaccine this is the Moderna MIA-1273 booster. Department of cardiology and cardiovascular research institutes a basal in Switzerland of course. Now this is published in the European Journal of Heart Fairlea. It's an open access journal of the heart failure association of the European Society of cardiologists so top flight stuff. This paper is accepted it is peer reviewed it's not yet published we've got a preprint not a pre printer a pre release copy because it's not a preprint because it is peer reviewed and a fully accepted paper in an international peer reviewed reputable journal. It's a prospective active surveillance study so they started they went forward collected the data as they went on and it's active surveillance they were actually looking for things in the past what we've had is retrospective passive surveillance so it's been passive in the past people have only collected data as patients have come forward to complain about it and it's been retrospective looking back this is this is a much better quality study or round and has produced really quite quite worrying results really and this study was industry independent it had nothing to do with the people that are making the money nothing to do with the people that are making the money this study was not carried out by the people that are making the money independent and the instigated by the investigators themselves so the aim they want to look at the incidence of potential mechanism of oligo symptomatic so oligo means few oligo symptomatic so oligo symptomatic myocardial injury is myocardial injury which has sometimes no symptoms or sometimes minimal symptoms it's oligo symptomatic but that doesn't mean to say they can't be quite severe severe consequences in fact just before we go on I think I'll just tell you something about the potential severe consequences now this is from the textbook of medicine that's used been used for generations now I'm just want to read something from this in most patients this is talking about myocarditis in most patients the disease is self-limiting and the immediate prognosis is excellent however death may occur due to ventricular arrhythmia or rapid progressive heart failure myocarditis has been reported as a cause of sudden and unexpected death in young athletes and we could go on and read about longer term complications not my words directly from David's principles and practice of medicine anyway let's get back to the study we're looking at we're looking at today is study from Switzerland following COVID mRNA vaccine booster so this is following boosters now they wanted to check on what was causing this and how often it was curing it's also very important a safety net for people that have been boosted so what they did if people had raised opponents at three days after the booster they said look you've got raised opponents after three days therefore let's go to repeat blood test therefore let's go to 12 lead ECG or the cardiological investigations as the cardiologist's deem bit take rest do not exercise because if you've got if you've got myocarditis and you just rest for a few days good chance you'll just go away get better if you go running or training there's a good chance not a good chance but there's a chance you can go into a ventricular fibrillation into a full cardiac arrest so the fact that these people were warned is so important probably not happening where you are soon and not happening where I so this safety netting screening and prevention of complications research methods so December 2021 to February 2022 hospital employees so these are healthcare workers mostly but hospital employees scheduled to undergo booster vaccination this is the Moderna they were assessed for vaccine associated myocardial injury blood being taken three days after the vaccine defined as an acute dynamic increase in so what they look for high sensitivity cardiactroponin concentration that's what they're looking for so we probably know this but if we have cells here in the heart so these would be cells in the heart these cells that constitute the myocardium now in these cells there are trapeonins so trapeonins are chemicals in these cells that's to do with the contraction of the myocardium now if the cell is damaged or insulted in any way if there's damage to the cell then what happens is there's actually a breach in the integrity of the cell wall and the trapeonins leak out so if these trapeonins are found in higher concentrations in the blood it indicates that myocardial cells have been damaged very very simple cardiac marker testing absolutely standard to look for trapeonins in all aspect of coronary care so they're looking for those above age and sex of the limits on day three blood taken 48 to 96 hours after vaccination and very importantly there was no alternative course so these patients were screened by proper doctors and scientists if they had a reason why they might have increased trapeonins like they just ran a marathon that they would be excluded from the study other causes of rave trapeonins were excluded this is a very thorough well conducted study and I've already seen quite a bit of misinformation about this study already but it is well conducted they did exclude other causes of um raised deponins 77 participants median age 37 more women than men in the healthcare environment so working age adults a minimal minimal risk from severe COVID almost almost none I mean all these patients have been exposed many times if the healthcare work is almost certainly now 40 participants 5.1 percent had a high sensitivity high sensitivity card aproponin concentrations on day three that were above the 99th percentile already that's high so 5.1 percent is already high showing uh much high levels of trapeonin you would expect um mRNA 1273 vaccine associated myocardial injury was adjudicated in 22 participants 2.8 percent god damn me if someone said to me look you could have had this vaccine as I did but by the way there's a 2.8 percent chance you'll have a vaccine associated myocardial injury I would have run a mile I am furious at not being fully informed about this and you should be too we've been treated like mushrooms on this and it's completely unacceptable it's just it's just anyway we'll leave that point there so 135 participants uh 135 recipients rather 135 who received the booster vaccine had vaccine associated myocardial injury I'm just going to read that out again one in 35 people who received the booster had vaccine associated myocardial injury this is this is a range of adverse reaction that is off the scale in health care off the scale and yet and yet in New Zealand and other places it's doing being actively and unethically some might say promoted um this is just off the scale risks off the scale completely the only way you would take this kind of risk in health care if the alternative was certain death otherwise you certainly wouldn't you know we just don't take this level of risk it's just complete madness what has happened here how how is this level let's let's keep to the let's keep to the data of the 777 two women on chest pain so what we're seeing here is most people here did not present with chest pain and yet they had this myocardial injury which could result in a focus for ventricular fibrillation an adverse consequence that is irreversible um of the 22 cases with mRNA 1 2 3 7 1 2 7 3 vaccine associated myocardial injury 20 cases are occurring women 2 in men now this is the complete reversal of what we got with the passive surveillance so active surveillance when we're actually looking for the issue is showing more myocardial damage in women as opposed to the passive surveillance where it was more young men that were affected interesting uh pity this wasn't looked for actively before and so young women could be fully informed given formed consent before they were vaccinated i mean as adults we're allowed to give informed consent for a lot of things and if we don't give informed consent then that changes the meaning completely completely changes the meaning of something that occurs if informed consent was not given and yet this is the case here informed consent has not been given because people this wasn't looked for and talked about a taponing elevations were mild and only temporary good no patients at ECG changes good non-developed major adverse cardiac events within 30 days good but of course these ones these ones these people were warned they had high opponents and knew not to go exercising all the difference in the world in the overall booster cohort so this is the cohort that were boosted remember 777 of them qualified many more were taken on but some were excluded so that's correct um median was five 9g per liter of troponin interquartar range was 4 to 650 percent were in the 46 range match controls it was three interquartar range three to five so basically we've got five 9g per liter in the uh boosted group and we've got three 9g per liter in the control group that is the big difference and significantly statistically that is significant p equals 0.0 not 1 so there's only a one chance in a thousand very highly significant result that that could have risen by chance so we accept that as a result evaluated on day three they were warning and then you not to go exercising and as a result of this well we can't say as a result of this but thankfully we can say no major adverse cardiac events are in 30 days so because um well we don't know why but certainly it's possible that these would have occurred of the patients hadn't been warned um no major adverse events following 30 day follow up so there was no cardiac arrests excellent no acute myocardal infarctions no acute heart failure no life threatening arrhythmias but these patients had been warned that their troponins were increased indicating they had myocardial damage so they knew not to exercise they were looked after by a doctor cases had comparable systematic reactogenicity so concentrations of cytokines and cytokine and antagonists things that work against the cytokines were markedly uh were markers of quantifying symptomatic inflammation so they looked for these things which was good now they also i'm not going to go into this in detail but they had lower concentrations of a couple of factors here granular psych granular psych microfagicol and stimulating factor but basically these are things that stimulate the immune response so that stimulates a lot of protection against bacteria for example this stimulates a lot of protection against viruses these were lower in the the people that had adverse reactions now the question is did the vaccine lower their protection against these viral and bacterial infections or was it that these protections were really ready lower making the people prone to vaccine damage that's one of the things that's currently being investigated needs further study anyway conclusion MIA Moderna vaccine associated myocardial injury was more common than previously thought so vaccine associated myocardial injury was more common than previously thought one in 35 people have had the vaccine massive being mild and transient more frequent in women versus men no adverse events the people were warned the watchman gave word that the enemy was attacking the city the possible protective role of the antiviral one and the anti-bacteria one were and further studies so that was from the Moderna booster similar studies from Pfizer that one was from Israel from memory that one was from Thailand from memory that's the Pfizer rad I do hope that this is not a sat if this is if this is supposed to be a joke that someone's put up it's in very poor taste but if not if it's what it appears to be then it's also in very poor taste attracting young people to take a MIA vaccine one in 35 participants had vaccine induced myocardial injury which more common than previously thought now if this anyone who's vaccinated after this should be given this information if not that they haven't been given they're not they're not giving informed consent therefore it's illegal if you don't give informed consent for other types of activity that's got legal implications we have to give informed consent MIA 1 2 7 3 vaccine associated myocardial injury was adjudicated in 22 participants 2.8 percent 1 in 35 recipients 2.8 percent had vaccine associated myocardial injury not much more to be said on that we look forward to an immediate and urgent response from regulators around the world if we don't get it then they just hold themselves up to public mockery ridicule what are they there for what are they there for if they don't act on this immediately we'll leave it there thank you for watching"
Covid 19 vaccine blood clot risk | Astrazeneca vaccine side effects,Shomu's Biology,2021-04-12,Im-WxMiN4Z4,"Hello friends, welcome back to another video from Shomu's Biology. In this video, we are going to talk about a very serious issue that is with the new COVID-19 vaccine and that is the AstraZeneca made vaccine. AstraZeneca model of the vaccine which is being used in the UK which is developed with the research done in the Oxford University along with AstraZeneca. That vaccine has issues with blood clot and particularly the blood clotting in brain. So is it real and how devastating this particular situation is and how frequent this blood clot is being observed in the administered person. That is what we are going to talk in this video. So watch this video to the end. Now the very first thing that I want to make clear before going into the discussion is that this video is made entirely based on the press releases conducted by different health care agencies on behalf of the trial that is going on with the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine in European countries. Although the most of the blood clotting conditions and factors are found in outside of India, although we are using the COVID shield which is being made with the formulation of Oxford AstraZeneca model in India but there are less incidents like that I think. So in that case whatever thing I am going to talk are not from any scientific research paper. So they are not peer reviewed or anything but information that is generally prescribed and provided by the health caring authorities from around the different countries of Europe. So and one more thing is that I am not going to encourage any particular vaccine here or discourage any particular vaccine when I am talking about the fact. I want to talk about few possibilities and few information which I gathered from different sources which are credible but not scientific sources which can give you the data as a peer reviewed research paper or journal. So see this information just to have an update or a news rather than a scientific fact because the fact is not being established yet we yet to go to find out what exact situation it is. So let us begin. So the very first thing to want to talk about is this Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is that many people have been commenting in my earlier videos regarding COVID shield vaccine that please talk about the blood clot issues and all. So what I can say is that blood clot issue is actually found out regarding the Oxford AstraZeneca model of the vaccine and not only particularly the AstraZeneca Oxford model of vaccine but other vaccines Johnson and Johnson model as well as there are Moderna models, Pfizer, Biontech model. So all these models are there and there are events of blood clot there are events of low platelet count in the administered person's body regarding all these vaccines. Now the question is why do these things are happening and we need to find it out in order to prevent it. And the second thing is that we need to find out a way to treat people who are currently having this kind of blood clotting symptoms. So the very first thing that I want to talk about is what is the problem. The problem right now with these vaccines that we want to talk about is blood clot. Now blood clot means where exactly this blood clot we are talking about the blood clot in the brain that is why they are fatal. Now they are a blood clotting in our body and blood clotting is an essential part of our body system because let us say there is a scratch in your hand and due to some wound and blood is flowing out. Body's natural response is to have a blood clot in order to prevent the blood loss right because blood loss means life loss. So the blood clotting is controlled by a cell in the blood and that is known as platelet. Platelet. So platelet regulates the blood flow and actually helps in the blood clotting and there is a series of events that actually results in the blood clot. It is a whole different thing that I am not going to talk here but ultimately we need platelet in order to maintain a blood clot in different places in our body. There is an internal bleeding or external bleeding. Now the problem is that if platelets are normally present in the body but they are not triggered. They are not activated in order to cause the blood clot always. So once there is a cut in the body internally or externally then this platelets are activated. Activated. So once the platelets are activated the platelets will allow a series of reaction, blood clotting reaction and that includes so many different factors. We are calling them as a blood clotting factor number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. So there are plenty of this blood clotting factor that actually relay a message and finally causes the blood clot to form very essential and very tightly regulated process. But the thing is if these platelets are kept activated in a normal situation if there is no bleeding internally or externally then what will happen? The blood clot will form in our body and the blood clot can form in both the place of the body it can form in the vein it can also form in the artery. So vein and artery it can form the blood clot in both the place, vein and artery. If the blood clot is done in vein then we call it venous blood clot and if it is done in artery we call it the arterial blood clot. Now this vein and arterial blood clot in normal body is dangerous because let us say a blood is flowing from, is pumped by the heart and is flowing from the heart to different places of the body. It is moving to my right hand like here. So the blood vessels are there through which the blood is moving in the arteries and moving in. And some of the blood clot is forming a particular artery then what will happen? The blood cannot reach that part of the, let us say the arteries moving the blood into our, into my pump. So due to the blockage there is no blood supply to the pump. So what will happen? The cells here in the pump they will not get the nutrients to survive so they start dying and there will be dead cells and necrosis and ultimately the death of the cells here. So this part of my body is wasted it is gone. So this is a big problem. The failure of that particular organ will be done where the blood clot is forming. So generally the blood clot in arteries are not common because the artery is a place where it carries oxygenated blood. The blood with oxygen is being carried out. So there is a huge pressure. So due to high pressure blood clot generally is not formed. But in vein the blood clot formation is quite common because vein takes the blood out away from the different organs and systems from the body towards the heart. So in our brain also there are arteries and veins. The arteries are taking blood from the heart to the brain against the gravity and while in the vein the blood is taken by the vein from the brain and is moving to the, it is moved to the heart. So what happens is that this vein which is connected from the heart to the brain if they have a blood clot then what will happen? Then there will not be a supply of the blood the necessary supply of the nutrient to the brain as a result of the brain. The part of the brain will be dead and the part of the brain once dead that part of the brain is responsible with different function of the body. The brain there are different locations and different locations of the brain are responsible to regulate different functions of the body. For example some portion is related to our speech function. Some portion is related to our motor function means movement and all. So let us say that there is the portion of the brain which is regulating our motor function and the blood clot forms there and that part of the brain is dead. Brain cells are dead so as a result of which what will happen the person will use the capability of speaking. So this is the devastating situation. So this can happen and this is what is happening exactly with the AstraZeneca model and we are calling it as what is known as brain venous thrombosis. In scientific term we are calling it brain venous thrombosis. Thombosis means the clotting of the blood. So due to the clotting of the blood the jamming of the vein venous thrombosis means there is a clotting of the blood to the cerebral vein. The vein that is connected to our brain. So the cerebral vein is there and cerebral vein is clogged with the blood clot due to the platelet aggravation. As a result of which there is no blood supply to the cerebral area as a result of which multiple functions of the body may be halted. Now the question is why it is done because as I said the platelet activation is necessary in this case the platelet is being activated by the vaccine and it somehow if the vaccine activates the platelet and it informs the platelet to create the blood clot without any sort of blood leakage of the body but still the platelet is being activated due to the presence of the vaccine. Now why exactly this is happening there is a big question mark still now there is no answer to that but we know that somehow the vaccine is activating the platelet to cause the blood clotting to initiate the blood clotting mechanism. Now this process is also given a scientific name and we are calling it as a thrombotic normally we call it as a thrombotic thrombocytopenia. This particular term means when the platelet count in a person's body decreases because when the platelet is involved with blood clot a lot of platelets from the blood is being utilized there due to the utilization of the platelet in the blood the total platelet count drops. Normally the blood platelet count must be present somewhere the baseline the least line is one lakh fifty thousand and it drops below that as well. So simply in simple terms we can say that overall platelet count drops below 25 percent than normal then we call it as a thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia means lowering the platelet count in the body and when it is thrombotic means due to the thrombosis of platelet means blood clotting factors of the platelet in other way the thrombocytopenia is occured. Now this vaccine can induce this thrombocytopenia so you call it as vaccine. Vaccine, sorry, vaccine induced immune, vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia this is the total name VITT. Vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia this is being caused due to the presence of the vaccine in the body. Now the question again why this thing is happening scientists are bad for about it doctors do not have any clue why exactly it is happening. But we got some information what are these information vital information let me write them down. Information number one is that this process is not very common it is very actually categorized as very rare even though one in one lakh people one in one lakh people given the vaccine Oxford Extrasenica model or the modern FUT or the Johnson Johnson model particularly I am talking about Oxford Extrasenica model one in one lakh person one in one lakh person can get this disease so get this situation after the vaccine has a side effect so it is very rare side effect but the question is even though we know that there is a side effect of blood clot there is a side effect that there is a clot formation in the in the vein that is supplying blood to the brain and due to that there is a brain hammerage possibility is it ethical for us to administer the vaccine even knowing that there is a one person chance out of one lakh is it ethical for us to proceed with it there is a big question I am not going to answer any of that I am not a person to judge this but this is a big question the second thing the second information that we got how severe it is how severe it is it must found out that six out of ten people got this ultimately lead to death six out of ten so 60 percent death after this thrombosis after this hemorrhage in the in the brain the third situation the third information that we got is between the gender whether it is happening to more male or female we found out that it is more common it is more common to female till now till now we found out it is more common to female although we are very less very no number of incidents till now so this data that I am sharing please look into the published date maybe you are watching it after many months or so this data might change and then do not abuse me in the comment section because always check the published date right now till this point more female are found to be affected with this situation and the fourth vital information that we got the age factor the age factor we found out that the young people have more chance of this developing this side effect then older then older people okay so this is what happening right now with this younger people has more this sort of effect now the question is we know from a simple statistic still now from one and a half year with the COVID-19 disease with SARS-CoV-2 virus is that this coronavirus infection is less severe in younger people right the virus infection is less severe to younger people but the impact of the vaccine side effect is more to younger people so again another big question can we put this younger people their life online to take the vaccine or we allow them to get the virus because the virus as per statistics is not killing them but the vaccine has a chance of killing them one in a one lack but still there is a chance all the very rare but there is a chance so we have to think of some alternative way some alternative dose for that reason there are many places there are many places many countries many European countries they are making it very clear that they only take this vaccine and mister this vaccine only after a sudden age 55 above some in some countries 50 above in some countries 60 above only are allowed to get this vaccine this particular model of the vaccine not the younger people are allowed to get the vaccine in India also the same formulation the COVID-19 vaccine is administered now 45 plus mostly so in India we do not find any kind of problem till now regarding this blood clot factor and all but still there is a chance always one in one lack chance is still there after this taking considering the fact that is a female and a young female so young female has a maximum chance of getting it I am not telling that they will all get it but it is very rare still there is a chance of getting it now apart from this information that we got here that is why in different countries in you know in different European countries they also told that one dose is taken for few people they stopped this dose further and they told that you can take other dose all by mention that in my older video many people oppose but now they are telling yes even if you took the dose of first dose of this and we now know there is a problem associated with this vaccine so we are not going to continue with that we will take the second dose from other vaccine so theoretically it is possible I do not know what is going to be happening in the practical situation now the question is why this thing is happening try to collect the dot you know as a microbiology as a immunology understanding how we can think of this now normally the platelet activation pathway is not linked with the idea of activation with some sort of vaccine and all because vaccine is simply we are utilizing a virus in this case in case of the of support estersenica model we are using the adenovirus okay they adenovirus this chimpanzee adenovirus simply that is we call it chardox CHDOX1 chardox1 chimpanzee adenovirus as a vector and we put the sarskov 2 gene inside of there it carries it so that it instigates the response against the sarskov 2 virus so many people say that in this case people means in this case research as obviously that this chimpanzee adenovirus somehow the variant that we use chimpanzee adenovirus they somehow has the capability of inducing that or the adenoviral DNA may have some capability of inducing that that is one theory the second theory is that doctors are saying that there is absolutely not 100 percent fault of the vaccine there is a not 100 percent fault of the vaccine they are saying that if it's a fault of the vaccine that it must not be that rare one in one lap it must be more common so they are saying that there must be two factors one is the vaccine undoubtedly and the second factor is some sort of co-factor that is present in the person's body that is influencing the activation of platelets while administering the vaccine okay they are calling it as a co-factor and that's a genetic factor that they are telling right now that may be a genetic factor because once we taste the blood and so many things nothing came out so they are telling it's not a biochemical factor that we are going to guess and we can guess easily with blood test and serum test no so it is probably a genetic factor and that genetic factor along with the vaccine administration administration is triggering the effect okay now the question if this is there are these two theories and sub theories are going on are not going to focus on that what we need to do now if a person have this we know that six out of ten will ultimately die because it's fatal because what happens if there is a blood plot between the blood supply of the of the vein through the through the brain so the vein drains the blood from the brain and put it and bring it to the heart and they like then they pump it to the lungs and purified and delivers it to the brain through the artery now the problem here is that if the brain stop receiving the the blood supply and an unnoticeable blood supply but clearance of the blood the brain stop functioning that part of the brain that any of the brain stop functioning and we call it brain hemorrhage and brain hemorrhage once formed there that portion of the brain stop doing its normal function and that is related to many things in the body so there will be confusions and it starts with symptoms like severe headache start with severe headache confusion difficulty is following breathing talking walking and all those things and slowly slowly it will kill that person mostly 60 percent dead chance after you have a brain hemorrhage like that now the question is how we can treat this even though still considering the fact that this virus is killing many people we are taking this vaccine if you if we take the vaccine and if there is a side effect like this then what we need to do what treatment possibly we can take the treatment that we can take here is blood thinners you know blood clot dissolvers so we can take the medicines that can dissolve the blood plot and the other medicines available out the blood thinners out there that can dissolve the plot apart from that particularly particularly we are using heparin as a drug here because heparin found to be very effective in dissolving blood clots in human body so use heparin to dissolve blood clot most of the time we found it pretty much effective till now in resolving the blood clot and preventing the brain hemorrhage but once the hemorrhage is done there is absolutely nothing that we can do to prevent it and the person has a high chance of death so we are still looking into all this processes the theory are being formed they are trying to test the theory with experiments and experimental data so let us see what where it goes but there is a high risk now the always the biggest question even though it is very rare even though one person has a chance out of one lack person to get this side effect can we proceed with it should we proceed with it I want to hear from all of my subscribers all of the people are watching this video now comment in this section in the video section below so that is it

Prosecutor who opposed COVID vaccine mandates dies after contracting virus,CBS News,2022-01-05,3XTzk9RouSY,"Orange County, Deputy District Attorney Kelly Ernbee has died of complications from COVID-19. She was a vocal critic of vaccine and mask orders. K-Chalin, Sarah Donshey got reaction Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. I'm Kelly Ernbee. I'm running for the State Assembly in the 74th District. Kelly Ernbee, a rising star in the Orange County Republican Party and Deputy District Attorney in Orange County, has died after contracting COVID-19. Just a phenomenal prosecutor and a great great friend. She worked as part of the Orange County District Attorney's Environmental Protection Team, prosecuting those accused of polluting the environment. Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said Ernbee had been out of work for several days and that his office was shocked to learn the news of her death. They were literally people who took a knee to the floor. I mean, they, it was like they were sucker punched. Today we're walking in Huntington Beach where I live. We're knocking on doors meeting the voters. Ernbee ran for an Orange County State Assembly seat in 2020, earning key endorsements from her party, but ultimately losing to the incumbent. She instead worked with the Orange County GOP as a committee member. The organization remembered her in a statement Tuesday that said in part, the Republican Party of Orange County is greater because of Kelly Ernbee and her passing leaves a giant void for all of Orange County. While Kelly is no longer with us, her fighting spirit will live on through our entire OCGOP family. Ernbee had been a vocal critic of COVID-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions during the pandemic. It was unclear if she was vaccinated herself. Her colleague said Tuesday they were frustrated by what they described as cruel responses to her death being posted online. I don't know quite frankly whether she was vaccinated or not. Quite frankly, it's none of my business, but I can just tell you this. Some of the comments and, you know, dialogue on my county webpage regarding Kelly have been just cruel. Ernbee was 46 years old and is survived by her husband. She was outspoken about a lot of issues, including vaccinations, but none of that. None of that takes away from the beautiful person she was. The Orange County GOP says they have yet to receive details about services and that they want to respect the family's privacy. I'm Sarah Dongey, KKL9 News."
Does the Pfizer Vaccine Stop Transmission?,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2022-10-17,JgrMzvasrm8,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. There's been a video that's been going around that captures an exchange in the European Parliament between a member and a Pfizer representative. And the question is, was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market? And the Pfizer representative said, no. Now this exchange has been characterized by some as being a bombshell, as being news, as never as being something that the Pfizer representative admitted to. And also, it has been characterized as completely upending the science on the ability of the COVID-19 vaccines to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Is that actually the case? Let's take a look. So here we have at the top SARS-CoV-2. And as you can see, what happens here is that it infects a person, and that's the primary case. And from there, there are trickle-down effects that happen very inefficiently. So only about 3.4 percent hospitalization occurs. And then from there, the patient may go to the critical care as a percentage of hospitalization. And then finally, they may die as a percentage of critical care involvement. So as we go down this line here, the number of people that reach this endpoint is dramatically reducing. Same thing if we go down here to secondary cases. That would be a transmission from one person to another. So imagine that you're a vaccine maker, and you want to make a vaccine that prevents these things. You're going to want to get the most amount of patients into your trial as possible so you can reach an endpoint. What do I mean by that? Imagine that you're a mile away, and I have a pile of dirt, and I have another pile of dirt. And from a mile away, you can't tell the difference between those two piles of dirt. You have to get closer. And the closer you get, the better you're able to resolve the differences between those two peaks of dirt. The same sort of thing. If you're looking at something on a screen that has low resolution, it's difficult to see through the pixelation. You need a better and better resolution to be able to see the difference. Well, that's the same sort of thing in studies. When you are doing a study, you're trying to resolve the difference about whether or not a vaccine is going to help with a virus. And the way you do that is by increasing the number of patients. Well, the problem is to resolve death. That's a very small pile of dirt. And you're going to have to get really, really close to be able to see that you're going to have to have a level of resolution that is pretty good. I mean, it's going to be 4K. And the reason is because only 1 percent of people who get infections will actually go to death. And so that's the same thing not only for death, but also for critical care, for hospitalization, and even here's the key for secondary cases. Secondary cases happen as a result of primary cases. But you get to have to have more people to be able to see whether or not there are secondary cases because you have to see, first of all, whether or not a primary case happens and then you need to watch them and test people around them to see if there's a secondary case. The bottom line is it takes a lot more people to do that in your study. It takes a lot more time and it takes a lot more money. And all you really need to show to get emergency use authorization for your vaccine is to show that you can block this. You can block primary infection. That's all you have to show to get emergency use authorization. You don't need to show that you can block this. You don't need to show that you can block this. You don't need to show that you can block this. You don't need to show that you can block this. All of those are not necessary for emergency use authorization. So you have a choice. Do you want to pay 10 times the amount of money and get 10 times more people and have your study last three or four or five times as long to get the same emergency use authorization? Or do you just want to see whether or not you can get emergency use authorization based on the fact that you can prevent disease in the person getting the vaccine, the recipient. You can obviously see what the best answer is. This doesn't mean that you won't do these studies. It just means that you won't do it before it goes to market. In other words, you don't need to do it before emergency use authorization only after emergency use authorization. Let's delve into that and see if that is a dirty secret or a well-known fact. So here's an article that I want you to look at and notice first that it was published on the 21st of October of 2020. Let me state that again. October of 2020. That was even before we had emergency use authorization for any vaccine. And this was published in the British Medical Journal written by Peter Doe she will COVID-19 vaccines save lives. Current trials aren't designed to tell us that. Well, yeah, in order to tell us whether or not it saves lives, you have to power it for death. And death is such a rare event at this point in time that you would have to have a lot of people in that study to be able to do that. This says here severe illness requiring hospital admission, which happens in only a small fraction of symptomatic COVID-19 cases would be unlikely to occur in significant numbers in trials. 3.4 percent hospitalization rate. You would have to involve 30,000 or more to be able to do the trial and you would actually need more than that to be able to look at severe disease because there'd only be a few even in a trial of 30,000. And actually the Pfizer trial was 36,000. They say in all the ongoing phase 3 trials, this is a key word here, phase 3 trials. This is the phase right before emergency use authorization. And in all of them, we'll talk about this, for which details have been released, laboratory confirmed infections, even with only mild symptoms, qualifies meeting the primary endpoint of definition. In the Pfizer and Moderna's trials, for example, people with only a cough and positive laboratory test would bring those trials one event closer to their completion. In other words, they're going to count that as an event. In other words, they made up their minds already. This is what they're going after, primary cases. They're not going after hospitalization. They're not going after critical care. They're not going after preventing death. And they are not importantly going after secondary cases. Why? Because it would cost way too much money and it would take way too long to be able to get to that endpoint. You have to realize here that it's not just a matter of money and time, but realize that people are literally dying in the hospital while this is going on. And so the question is, is if they can get something that can prevent infection in the primary case, that may be all they need to do to eventually prevent death down the road. They could actually do a study down the road to figure that out. Why spend the time now trying to figure all this stuff out when it could delay the implementation of this vaccine to the market? Here is the table that is associated with that article that was published back in October of 2020. You can see here where you've got the different vaccines. Moderna Pfizer AstraZeneca Janssen Sino-Farm Sinovac. And you can see that the number of people that they have in their trial is perfectly powered to get the results of primary infections. You always have to power your study before you can register it, before you can start recruiting before you get sponsorship. You have to know how many people are going to be in the study and has to do a lot of things. The recruitment, the likelihood of your intervention to work, if you're going to see whether or not parachutes work with people jumping out of planes, you don't need to power that study really high to figure that out because we kind of know that parachutes are really effective, at least we think so. And so it's not like you're going to need a study of 10,000 people jumping out of planes to figure out that parachutes work. That kind of powering of the study could be done on maybe two or three people. It wouldn't be a very ethical study, but nevertheless, that's the kind of thing that we're talking about here. The intervention, guess how many people you're going to need, what the event rates are, how many people you're going to have with endpoints and then figure out whether or not it's going to meet statistical significance. And all of these companies came up with the same idea. Notice what else they came up with. They all decided to say, hey, are we going to look for interruption of transmission, person to person spread? Moderna said nope, Pfizer said nope, AstraZeneca in both the United States and the UK said nope, Johnson and Johnson said nope, Sinopharm said nope, and Sinovac said nope. And why did they say that? Because of exactly what we just talked about, you're going to wait for somebody to get infected and then watch them and wait longer and then see whether or not other people around them get infected. Why? You can do that after emergency use authorization. You can do post marketing studies to see whether or not that actually happens. It makes no sense whatsoever for a vaccine company to make that kind of an endpoint in a study that needs to get done quickly and efficiently and a time when people are dying in the hospital. So let's look at what was happening. Here we have new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people. So this is on a daily basis and you can see here this blue bar is the period of time in which the phase three trial occurred. This was pretty early on. Notice not a lot of cases going on here. Not a lot of cases means that you're going to be hanging around for a while to reach that 30,000 or 36,000 requirement for subjects. Here in green, this is the United States that the trial ended pretty quickly when cases started to go up. You can see them going up pretty rapidly here. That's when they were probably able to meet their endpoint of 30,000 and then they packaged up the data. They sent it up to the FDA and given emergency use authorization on December 11th, which you can see right here. Everything after that is post marketing. Everything up to this point is pre-market. And again, the question was to Pfizer, did you do any research or have an endpoint in your study that looked at transmission from primary to secondary endpoints in the answer was no? And we've just discovered that that wasn't a dirty secret. That was well known and that was kind of the industry standard. So there you go. Let's move on. And let's just be complete here and look at the actual data that Pfizer got. As you can see here, there was 18,000 people in the placebo arm and also over 18,000 people in the intervention arm. Look at the numbers we're talking about here. 162 people came down with COVID in that short period of time and eight people in the vaccine and they were able to calculate in 95 percent efficacy. The absolute risk reduction was 0.85 percent. This is the Johnson and Johnson, but we're not talking about Johnson and Johnson. We're talking about Pfizer because they were being questioned by members of the European Parliament. So let's take a look and see in the words of the FDA, why did they give them this emergency use authorization? And they say here in their news release on December 11, 2020, quote, the FDA has determined that the Pfizer, BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer, BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine may be effective in what? Preventing COVID-19. It doesn't say here that it's effective at preventing spreading it or that it is effective at preventing death from COVID-19 or hospitalization from COVID-19. No, it's simply saying that it's effective at preventing COVID-19. What's implied here is in the recipient. And just to nail that point home, further on in this FDA news release that was released on December 11, 2020, it states here, at this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection. Nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person. So it's very clear here that the FDA is being very specific about what it does know and what it does not know. Of course, there will be post marketing data and research that will help to clarify those questions. To highlight that again, Pfizer not only did not look at endpoints for transmission to other people, but also did not look at reduction in severe COVID-19, admission, ICU, or even death. Pfizer was not alone. Moderna didn't do it, and in fact, none of the others did it. Here in the UK, there's a little kind of an asterisk there, which talks about a trial registration where they actually did look at that. But for the most part, across the board here, nobody's looking at those endpoints. And it's pretty obvious when you think about why that's the case. One of the things that I think is really important, and I say this a lot to my students, and I think it is applicable here, is this statement. The absence of evidence does not equal the evidence of absence. In other words, just because Pfizer, Biotech, did not make in their face-through trials before marketing, the endpoint of transmission, it doesn't mean that the Pfizer-Biotech vaccine doesn't prevent transmission. And why would I say that? Well, there's a number of trials that actually looked at this after marketing. So here's an article, we're not going to go through all of these. I just want to show you that it's not like we're just pulling this out of thin air. There's hard data that was published in peer-reviewed journals that looked at this. This is a correspondence to the New England Journal of Medicine. And notice, a lot of these studies were done in August. This was published in August, so you know that the work actually was done earlier in the year between January 4. So this is done almost immediately. In February 28, 2021, there was almost a million household contacts of unvaccinated index patients, and there was 96,000 secondary cases of COVID-19. So they're looking at these secondary cases. And what do they find? Overall, the likelihood of household transmission was approximately 40 to 50 percent lower in household of index patients who had been vaccinated 21 days or more before testing positive than in households of unvaccinated index patients. This is data that shows that the vaccine prevents transmission. Now was it done by Pfizer and was it done by Pfizer before marketing? No. But that doesn't mean it wasn't done. Again, the absence of evidence doesn't equal the evidence of absence. Study number two. American Journal of Epidemiology March 3, 2022, published. Compared with unvaccinated and unisolated adult teenagers aged greater than 12 years, contacts vaccination reduced the risk of infection among unisolated adult teenager contacts. Relative risk is 0.21. That's an 80 percent reduction here in this cohort of the vaccine. An isolation they say reduced the risk of infection among unvaccinated adult teenagers. Even more, relative risk there was 0.12. That's an 88 percent relative risk reduction. Within households, vaccination reduced both the risk of infection and of transmission if infected. When contacts were unvaccinated, isolation also led to important reductions in the risk of transmission. So again, here's another paper that was published. This one in March of this year that shows clearly that vaccination reduces transmission. Here's another one. Very prestigious journal science. Published March because a lot of the data was done prior to that. Before June 1, 2021, they're looking at 10 to 90 days after the second dose. They say here vaccination reduced susceptibility to infection by 89 percent, whereas vaccine affecting this against infectiousness given infection was 23 percent. During the days 10 to 90 after the second dose before June 1, 2021, they go on. And can prevent transmission by both providing protection against infection and reducing the infectiousness of vaccinated individuals who do become infected. Neither of these are typically directly measured in vaccine trials. Let me repeat that. Neither of these are typically directly measured in vaccine trials. This is pretty common knowledge. I remember this when I was thinking about getting the vaccine. I was looking at the data. I didn't just do it blindly. I looked at the phase 3 trial and I remember specifically. That was the discussion that we were having at the time. There is good data that prevents me from getting infected, although we don't have data that it will stop me from transmitting to somebody else, which is a big concern of mine. I work in the ICU and I could bring something home to my family. And I have people living with me that are susceptible. I still decided to get vaccinated. Even though I knew there was no trial data from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trial data phase 3 trials that showed that it prevented transmission, everyone knew that. They say here by analyzing data on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among household members in Israel, we provide measures affecting this BNT-162BT, which is the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, against the susceptibility to infection and against infectiousness given infection. Our results show evidence of a slight reduction in the infectiousness of vaccinated individuals who become infected in addition to protection against the susceptibility to infection, lending to an overall reduction in the risk of transmission. This is the third paper now that shows exactly what we've been talking about. Here's another paper, the indirect effect of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination on healthcare workers unvaccinated household members. This is published in March of this year, and here they used an administrative, nationwide data set of SARS-CoV-2 infections, vaccination records, demographics, unique household IDs. They conducted an observational cohort study to estimate the direct and indirect effectiveness of MRI-based COVID-19 vaccines in reducing infections among vaccinated healthcare workers and their unvaccinated household members. They say our estimates for adults imply indirect effectiveness of 39.1 percent, two weeks, and 39.0 percent eight weeks after the second dose. We find that the indirect effect of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines within households is smaller for unvaccinated children than for adults and statistically insignificant. Here we show that mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines are associated with a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections not only among vaccinated individuals, but also among unvaccinated household members in a real world setting. This is published in Nature. Peer reviewed. Here's another paper, a 146,000 tested context of 108,000 index patients, 37 percent had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. In index patients who became infected with the alfaviriant two vaccinations with either Pfizer or the AstraZeneca, as compared with no vaccination, we're independently associated with reduced PCR positivity with contacts. What was their conclusion in the study? Vaccination was associated with a smaller reduction in transmission of the delta variant, than of the alfaviriant, and the effects of vaccination decreased over time. PCR CT values at diagnosis of the index patient only partially explained decreased transmission. These studies are not funded by the pharmaceutical companies. This one, particularly here, was funded by the UK Government, Department of Health, and Social Care, and others, and published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. Let's recap here. Did Pfizer-BioNTech do studies that had, as endpoints, transmission of the virus? And the answer is no. They did not do that prior to emergency use authorization. Does that mean those studies have not been done? Does that mean that we have no basis of understanding for whether or not the vaccines can reduce transmission? No. The absence of evidence prior to EUA does not mean evidence of absence. Here we have clear evidence of presence that actually shows that there is decreased transmission when people are vaccinated. It's not 100 percent, but it's certainly not 0 percent. And you can see here clearly on the graph, they didn't have a lot of time. They needed to get to their endpoints, and their endpoint was preventing disease in the recipient. That was the FDA approved, FDA authorized indication as we read directly from the source dated December 11, 2020. So you may be asking this question. If those endpoints, like death, transmission, hospitalization, if they're so rare that you're not even willing to do a study on it because it takes so long to do, then why are we so concerned about these things? If it's so rare, then why do we even have to be vaccinated in the first place? Let's answer that question. Notice that the prevalence of the disease during the Phase III trials of Pfizer were much smaller than, let's say, here or here when we get to Delta, or even here, which is practically 10 times the amount when we get to Omicron. So I think what we need to do is look at this from a different standpoint. 1 percent sounds like a really small number. In fact, it is a small number when you're talking about recruitment for a trial. But when you're talking about 1 percent dying in a population overall, and it takes the time for the virus to spread, but in a population of 350 million people in the United States. And when you're talking about that on a daily basis, hundreds of thousands of people are actually coming down with the virus, there are downstream consequences to those problems. This graph right up here is the daily confirmed cases. It's exactly like the graph we showed before, except here it's just the United States that we're looking at, and we're actually looking at raw numbers here. That first wave that hit us in December, I mean, there are other ways, but the biggest wave here that really hit us, notice here that two to three hundred thousand people a day are coming down with COVID. If your hospitalization rate is 3.4 percent, and what's 3.4 percent of 300,000? Well, 1 percent of 100,000 is 1,000. 1 percent of 300,000 is 3,000, and 3 percent of that would be 9,000, potentially going to the hospital on a daily basis. We don't have to actually do the math because fortunately, our world in data helps us with that. We have a graph here that looks at the number of COVID-19 patients in hospital. The key that I want to show you here is the number of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit. How many regular ICU beds do we have in the United States? 59,000 regular ICU beds is what we have in the United States. And if we look here at the number of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit, in that first wave, there was 30,000 total patients at that point in the intensive care unit, 30,000 from COVID-19. If you're a hospital, and you're trying to make money, you're going to make sure that you have perfect staffing for your ICU. That means the number of patients that need to have ICU care, you're going to have your ICU sized correctly so that it's not too big, it's not too small, and you're going to have the number of ICU nurses that you need to have in perfect ratio for those patients available so that you can call them. And of course, there's going to be ups and downs, but you're going to be able to flex with that. What we see here during this time period is a tremendous surge, unlike we have ever seen. There was a period of time where I literally worked 35 days without taking a break. There were nurses in the intensive care unit where I was working that normally would be seeing just two patients, Nazaratio, I work in California, and very strict rules on that. They were seeing four patients, and it was because California had basically released everybody from those strict standards. And I'd really love people who went through similar experiences to write in the comments. There were nurses that actually developed PTSD from this period. There were people that literally came in and died within minutes, people that were dying in ambulances. There was a period of time that we were almost out of ventilators. We thought we had enough ventilators, but they were actually disposable ventilators and would not work for patients with COVID-19. The point is that we had so many people coming in to the hospital that we could not take care of them. And so this caused us to have to come up with something called a crisis protocol. So I want to show you here an example we've talked about before Idaho is an example, but there's many other states that we could talk about. They were 47th out of 50 in terms of the levels of vaccination. And they experienced a tremendous influx of patients to the hospital that were sick during this time, and they just could not be taking care of. And so what had to happen during the Delta surge, September 6, 2021, well before any kind of federal mandate on healthcare providers being vaccinated. As you can see here Idaho is a dark blue state and their mandate vaccination was February 14th of 2022. And their second one was to be March 15th of 2022. So this is well before any kind of vaccine mandates caused nurses to go into shortage. We see here multiple activations and expansions of crisis care. This was also happening to a degree in Utah, Montana, and also happening in Texas. These were in areas where vaccination rates were low, and you can look this up and see it for yourself. This is a healthcare crisis protocol from the state of Nebraska, dated May 10th, 2021, published by the Nebraska Medical Emergency Operations Center. This is not unique to Nebraska. Every state has one and it basically looks the same. When we were working here in Southern California, the state came to us and said you need to come up with a crisis protocol so that when you run out of nurses, ventilators, dialysis machines, you know how you're going to allocate scarce resources. The foundation of this approach to healthcare crisis protocol is that such difficult decisions must be based on criteria that ensure that every patient has equitable access to any care from which they might benefit. When this happens, it doesn't matter if you have COVID-19 or don't have COVID-19. Regardless of whatever disease you have, if you have a heart attack, if you're driving in a car and get into a car accident, if you've got a cold, it doesn't matter what it is, and you come into the hospital, you're going to have a crisis protocol done. You're going to be triaged into how sick you are and what kind of resources are going to be allocated to. And that has nothing to do with how well you are able to get over COVID-19. How good your immune system is, is going to have no bearing on the fact that you are in a car accident and you need to have surgery. If this gets implemented, you're going to have limited resources at the hospital that you would be going to. What does this actually mean? Well, let me show you. So this is called the CARE Continuum. Conventional, this is what we're doing all the time. Usual patient space, usual staff, normal supplies, usual care. Continiency, things get a little bit ramped up. Once you hit crisis, we're putting people in classrooms. We're putting people in garage structures. We're getting trained staff unavailable at this point. There's just nobody there. We got a patient on the ventilator. Normally, a respiratory therapist would be taking care of them. There isn't one. So what do we do? We extend the number of people that can take care of it or we say instead of taking care of five patients tonight, you're taking care of 10. Critical supplies lacking and possible reallocation of life sustaining procedures. What's the standard of care? Now, it's healthcare crisis protocol. So, whereas before, if somebody had an appendicitis, they would get surgery. Not anymore. We don't have those resources. We can't provide that care because we've overstretched our healthcare industry because we have too many people coming to the emergency room and the hospital. Special considerations for reallocation of life sustaining treatments. There are specific ethical issues involved in withdrawal of life sustaining treatment. These issues may be particularly pronounced when resources are withdrawn from critically ill patients who are already receiving them at a time that a healthcare crisis protocol is initiated. That means Mr. Jones came in a week ago. He's still on the ventilator, but now we have so many people that have come in. It's not a first-come-first-served basis. However, in the event of a worsening crisis adhering to a first-come-first-served principle for those who are already receiving critical care prior to the application of healthcare crisis protocol may result in unjust allocation of resources. That means if we have somebody further down on the ladder, even though they came in first, may get the ventilator taken off of them and put on to somebody else who is deemed to be a better allocation. They say, as such, careful assessment and allocation will be necessary in order to maximize benefit during a crisis. This was the issue at our hospital, is I thought it would be unethical for me to be involved in those decisions. I did not want to be the ICU doctor taking care of these patients, and then for them to come to me and say, we want you to pick the person that is going to basically come off the ventilator. That would be very difficult for me to live with that kind of a decision, but somebody has to make that decision. COVID-19 is like an elephant in the room that's dark, and we're all feeling different parts of this elephant. Someone's feeling the feet, and they think it's a tree. I'm feeling the trunk, and I think it's a snake. I experience COVID-19 in this kind of environment where people were coming into the intensive care unit, and they were dying in such vast numbers that I never want to see that ever again. I never want to see a activation of healthcare crisis protocols, where we are taking people off of resources because we just don't have enough of them. That is the reason why I have been so motivated in these last two years to come up with any piece of Swiss cheese that I can possibly get that will stop people from having to come to the hospital. This is the reason why I introduced hydrotherapy in my intensive care unit. This is the reason why I introduced black seed oil in the dietary plans of patients on the floor that could still eat. I didn't care if we had randomized placebo controlled trial data to say yes or no, if the risks was sufficiently low, and there was nothing to lose, I was willing to do it because I don't ever want to see that happen again. I want to tell you exactly why I'm talking about this. Why there is this understanding that vaccines reduce transmission is because we actually have studies that demonstrate this, and we don't need to have a pre-marketing study done by the manufacturer to show that this is in fact the case. In fact, in no other vaccine company that has made a COVID-19 vaccine has been the case. That's number one. Number two, we have limited resources in our healthcare industry. If a significant amount of people are not protected against the virus, there is going to be a lot of people going to the hospital, and there are going to be a lot of difficult decisions made. And I don't want to see that. That's why I am for early treatment. That's why we promote those things on MedCram.com. That has been my goal in the last two years to prevent death, hospitalization, and illness from this and any other virus. I usually stick strictly to data, but you can't separate out your personal experiences sometimes. I hope this explanation has been helpful. Thanks for joining us."
Omicron BA.5 vs. Vaccines and Previous Infection,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2022-07-26,xtLL45vQEF0,"Welcome to another Midscrame COVID-19 update. The question that's on a lot of people's minds is what kind of immunity do they have against SARS-CoV-2? So today we've got a unique opportunity to look into every type of immunity that you could possibly have against SARS-CoV-2, whether you were vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Novavax, Sinopharm, even just gotten the SARS-CoV-2 infection. What kind of immunity could you possibly have against the most recent variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is predominant now across the globe and which is the BA-5 variant? And that's what we're going to look at today. Now there's this paper that was published and it's out of Dr. Visler's group at the University of Washington and they've recently published this in the prestigious journal Science and the articles titled Omicron Spike Function and Neutralizing Activity, elicited by a comprehensive panel of vaccines. This paper actually goes into a lot of things, but one of the things that they go into specifically that interested me and probably you at this point is whether or not there is antibody activity against these different Omicron variants. And I think this paper does a really good job at answering some of these questions you may notice in the author list, some names like Alessandro Sede, Shane Cratty, who we've actually had on this program before. And of course it's out of the University of Washington which has a good track record here and that's where the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States first appeared. So if we go to the article, let's look at what they did here because I think this is really interesting. They say here, we next assessed the plasma neutralizing activity elicited in humans by each of the seven vaccines and those are the seven vaccines that we talked about at the beginning. But in addition to the seven vaccines, they also looked at natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and they evaluated the immune evasion associated with the constellation of estimutations present in the B-A-1, B-A-2, B-A-2.121 and the B-A-4-5 Omicron sublineages. And what they did next here is they looked at how well the plasma from subjects who had each of these types of either vaccination or infection did against neutralizing these different sublineages. And the way they did that was they basically took the spike proteins from these sublineages and connected it with a vesicular stilmititis virus and placed it on a petri dish that had with it the Vero-E6 and TMP-RSS-2 cells to see whether or not the serum from these subjects could protect the cells from becoming infected with these specific Omicron sublineages. So basically what they were doing was an in vitro experiment to see how well antibodies from these subjects could protect against the various different sublineage Omicron and other variants of SARS-CoV-2. So when they look at the regular infection with SARS-CoV-2, specifically you should know that the plasma, which was obtained from individuals previously infected, were the ones in that area up in Washington where the first SARS-CoV-2 appeared in the United States and that's known as the Washington one like SARS-CoV-2 strain. And as you may remember, this was occurring well before any vaccination of SARS-CoV-2 took place, almost a year before. So let's take a look at the data. Here's the data and I've branched this out here below so you could see the data more clearly at the bottom we have exactly what type of serum we're talking about. And in this case this is the SARS-CoV-2 infection and we're looking at neutralization and so the higher the number, the more immunity there is, the more antibodies there are and the stronger the antibody response against the spike protein. So high numbers are good. And you can see here we have Moderna, we have Pfizer, we have Novavax, Johnson and Johnson, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and Sinopharm. And specifically each one are given in the doses that they are approved for. So Moderna is 2 doses, Pfizer is 2 doses, Novavax is 2 doses, Johnson and Johnson is 1 dose, AstraZeneca 2 doses, Sputnik V is 2 doses and Sinopharm is also 2 doses. Now unfortunately they were not able to get the serum at each point along the infection. So specifically what we're looking at here is the mean days after the event. And so for the infection this is 41 days after the infection on average. So this is on average if we look at the average subject in this category, how many days after the average infection did they submit their serum. For Moderna it was 13 days after the second dose, Pfizer 14 days after the second dose, Novavax 82 days after the second dose, Johnson and Johnson was 79 days after the first dose, because remember there's only one dose with Johnson and Johnson. And about 30 days for AstraZeneca after the second dose, Sputnik V was around 60 to 90 days that we always have as a range there after the Sputnik dose and then 69 days after Sinopharm. So what we see here in each category is the different types of variants. So the G614 as you can see here was the very first strain that we had in the United States. And of course we went through alpha and we went through delta and we came to Omicron. And so what we're looking at here is Omicron BA1, Omicron BA2, the 2.121. And finally the one that is current at the time of this video production, which is the BA4 and 5. And the first thing that you can see here right off the bat is regardless of which category we're talking about. If you look very carefully across the board at each of these categories of BA45, whether it's the infection or the vaccines, you will see that in general there is less of a response against the BA45 sub variant. Although there is still some activity and so they've actually labeled this with numbers. And what they're looking at here is what fold reduction there is in the neutralization titers. You can see here from Moderna versus the G614, the original strain that was used in the production of the vaccine. There's about a 29 fold reduction in the neutralization ability of the antibody to specifically neutralize the virus or Pfizer. With the Omicron BA5, it's an 18 fold reduction. With Novavax, there is a 23 fold reduction. And some of these we actually don't have numbers because of statistical significance. But you can clearly see that there is a numerical reduction in each one of these cases. I should point out that antibody neutralization is not the end all B all of the activity of vaccination. For those following Medcrem, you should understand this and we've talked about this before. There are T cell responses and T cells have a very robust ability to cross over and to manage these different spike proteins more than just immunoglobulins from B cells. This is a surrogate for antibody neutralization. This does not necessarily mean that this contributes also into the ability of T cells to do their job. And we'll talk about that more and we've seen this over and over again. With different variants, even though the vaccines have been modeled after the original spike protein, there still is very good efficacy of the vaccines to prevent hospitalization and the worst outcomes of COVID-19 even though it may not be preventing infection. And that's why it's so important to understand the difference when we're reporting in the news media about the difference between cases and hospitalizations. Now even there, as an aside, we'll talk about hospitalizations, you will see an increase in hospitalizations when you see an increase in cases. And the reason why is because every hospitalization in the hospitals that I work out are tested for SARS-CoV-2. So you might have people coming in with appendicitis or colisostitis. These are basically completely unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. And they might be positive because they may be carrying a subclinical or very mild form of SARS-CoV-2. So the question really is not if people are being hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2, but rather are people being hospitalized because of SARS-CoV-2. And I can tell you that whereas at the beginning of the pandemic, when we were seeing hospitals overflowing and putting two patients into an ICU room and having ICU nurses taking care of four patients rather than two patients, there was no question that people that were being admitted with SARS-CoV-2 were being admitted because of SARS-CoV-2. Now that's as opposed to what I'm seeing today, at least locally in my hospital in Southern California, where we are seeing some people coming in with SARS-CoV-2, but they're not coming in because of SARS-CoV-2, at least not at this point as yet. Hopefully that stays that way. The point being that vaccines have much more to their abilities to protect than just neutralizing antibody. But nevertheless, I think it's an interesting exercise to look at this in vitro study to see how well do these vaccines that are based on the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 do against the newest BA-45. Unfortunately, we're not comparing apples to apples here because these are specific days after the vaccine or the infection have been given. And of course, they do the best job that they can and they report that these are the days. Interesting to note that the NOVAVAX, which is 82 days out, and the Johnson and Johnson, which is 79 days out, you can kind of see a difference in comparison there. Whereas the Moderna, which is 13 days and Pfizer, which is 14, seem to have more of a robust response. It's interesting that NOVAVAX is fairly similar to the Pfizer, even though it's about 14 days out. But it's really hard to make that comparison between vaccines. So finally, the last thing I want to point out, you've probably seen this already with this graph. Is simply that each one of these vaccines represent the full dosing of the vaccine without boosters. And so the question here in 2022, summer going into fall and then finally into wintertime, if you have been fully vaccinated and you're considering getting a booster, the question is, is why would you get a booster that is based on an old strain or variant of SARS-CoV-2, which doesn't exist anymore to try to protect you against a variant like BA-5? Is it going to be beneficial? Even with just neutralizing antibodies, let's take a look at the data. That's exactly what they decided to do in the study at a University of Washington. So let's take the scenario again of, I've had two shots of either the Pfizer and or the Moderna. And the question is, should I get a third booster of Moderna or Pfizer at this point? And so they actually looked at that. Here we have again the regular infection. Here we have Moderna at two doses and Pfizer at two doses. And then what we see here is about 30 days out after the third dose of either Pfizer or Moderna. So this could be a Pfizer, Pfizer Moderna or Moderna Moderna Pfizer. What are the antibody, the neutralizing antibody results at this point? And you can see clearly here that whereas this was two, that this is three. Let's look at the BA-4-5 because that's the question that we have. And clearly you can see here that there is an improvement. Even though this is a third shot of a vaccine that's based on an ancestor of BA-4 and five, there's still a benefit specifically against the BA-4-5 sub variant. You can see that in all of those cases that you go from fairly low neutralization titers to a fairly higher neutralization titer even though you're not using a vaccine that is based on BA-4-5. Why do the neutralization antibody titers get lower with time? That might be a disadvantage. But in fact, it's an advantage. You want this to happen. Imagine an immune system with every antigen that it ever saw in its entire life. We continue to pump out in the same amounts and the same quantity, the same amount of antibodies that it did. Eventually, your body would be filled with antibodies. It has to be able to decide which antibodies are important to produce and which antibodies are not important to produce. So long as they have the memory cells ready to produce at will, you're going to be okay. That's the whole point of a vaccine is to allow your immune system, which is so complex in such an amazing system. The ability to see ahead of time the viral proteins so that at a moment's notice if there is a rechallenge of that viral protein, the immune system can then wake up the cells that are able to make the antibodies and to make them quickly. When the immune system doesn't have that foreknowledge, it takes a long time and the virus gets ahead start. That's the whole purpose of a vaccine or being infected previously. Let's go to another example here. How about if you've had two shots of Novavax? In the United States, we haven't even had the opportunity to get vaccinated with Novavax because it's not available, but there are people outside of the United States where Novavax has actually been approved. And the question is, is if you got a third dose of another type of vaccine, either Moderna, Pfizer, or J&J, what would that do specifically to your neutralization titers against BAA45, even though you're getting a vaccine which is based on an ancestor of that subvary? And the answer is, as you can see here very clearly, that neutralization titers go up with a third dose. What about Johnson and Johnson? You've had one shot of the Johnson and Johnson, and the question is, should you get a booster, either with J&J or Pfizer in this case is what they looked at. And in both of those cases, significant improvement in neutralization titers in patients who have had one shot of J&J. And you can see here the mean days after the event that we're looking at. In this case, it was 14. What about AstraZeneca? Here we have two doses, about 30 days alpha, and we vaccinate with either Moderna or a Pfizer vaccine. And what happens? 87 days later, instead of having neutralization antibodies in this range, we have it in this range. I think this is actually really good information because things are so diverse now, with people getting different types of vaccines. And the question is, what should I do? Is it going to be an improvement, especially as we're now going into the fall? And when the daylight hours are becoming less and less, and we've talked a lot about things that you can do that have nothing to do with the vaccines that can improve your innate immunity. And we've talked about getting out into the sun. We've talked about making sure you're getting enough sleep. We've talked about making sure that you are exposing your eyes to bright light in the morning to keep your circadian rhythm in check and making sure that you're not exposing your eyes to bright light after nine o'clock at night. We've also talked about hydrotherapy. We're not afraid to talk about these things that can actually improve your overall health. But I think a lot of people are interested in knowing about what's going on with the different types of vaccines. And also this variant that's going around. So what about Sputnik? And there's not a lot of people here in the United States that have had Sputnik. I'm sure there's some people around the world that are watching that may have a question about that. Here we see 60 to 90 days after two doses of Sputnik. We're seeing a reduction in the neutralization antibodies. What happens if you add to those two shots of Sputnik, either an AstraZeneca or a Pfizer vaccine? You'll see that there is an increase in the neutralization antibody tighter. What about Sinopharm? This is also a vaccine that is very popular in Asia. Two doses of Sinopharm, 69 days later, on average. What do you see here? You're seeing antibody titers in this range. If you were to add a Moderna or a Pfizer to that, you would see that there's a significant increase there in terms of neutralization of the antibody tighter. So I found this interesting graph that they put in the paper. And this is looking at neutralization versus days post-symthom onset or the last dose of their vaccine course. You can see here the different vaccines and infection here. Infection is the green dot. You can generally see that as time goes on, regardless of what you're talking about, those antibody titers are going to get less and less. And again, here specifically, we're not actually measuring antibody tighter, but we're measuring the amount and the quality of these antibodies to neutralize the spike protein. Just want to make that clear. But we know that in the human body that antibody titers do get less and less over time. And so it's not surprising to see this. Again, we said the reason why that would be the case. Again, we can't keep antibodies at the same level for the whole time for every single antigen that the body ever sees, because then we would have just too many antibodies floating around in our circulation. One of the things I think was interesting that it made me go back and reflect a little bit is looking at the natural infection. I remember Dr. Crottie in an interview on Medcram talking about some of the issues regarding vaccination versus natural immunity as it's often called. So we're looking at just a regular infection. And as you can see here, the one thing that sort of distinguishes this previous infection from the antibodies that are created from these vaccines is that we see a lot of very low neutralization levels here with previous infection. And we really don't see that with any of the other types of options here in terms of the vaccines. And if you think about why that might be the case, you can imagine that there's some people that could get SARS-CoV-2 positive, but they might have a very, very mild infection because they got a very small inoculate. In other words, enough to make them positive, but not enough to really create a good immune response. You can imagine that the immune system, if it gets just a very small challenge, might not make that robust enough response to give you immunity to the next infection. You can imagine that there is what we call heterogeneity there with that. Whereas with the very standard doses of a vaccine, you're going to get a high enough dose that in most cases your body is going to have a response to that. The nuance to that is that actually people who have been infected with COVID-19, their immune memory is very heterogeneous. There are a lot of differences from person to person. And so we noted that. Other studies have noted that. Where if you look at the data in our paper, whether you look at the antibody measured or the B-Sounds or the different kinds of T-Sounds, there's about a hundred-fold range between any two people or it's sort of opposite ends of the scale. That's a big difference. So we can say, yes, overall, the vast majority of people have measurable memory and it looks like decent memory. But if you look at specific individuals, there are big differences and a hundred-fold differences. And as I said, we don't know what exactly is needed to protect against this virus. But certainly a hundred-fold difference is big, right? If you were playing a basketball game, and one team scored one point and the other team scored a hundred points, that's not very close. And even say there is a difference there that you should pay attention to. Immunology is not a basketball game, but still, right? That's a large difference. And we don't know how to interpret those details. And so in fact, we said, you know, probably it's plausible that people at the low end of that are more susceptible to reinfections because it looks like they might have a lot less immunity than some other people. And unfortunately, there's no simple way to predict which person is which. Right? So we can say at a population level, yeah, most people have measurable immune memory. But some people, something like 5 percent of people are really at the low end. So are those people at greatest risk? And so that's where the immunology is. If you put on your hat as an individual, or if you put on your hat as a public health professional, right, you're going to view those data in some different ways, right? So at an individual level, one of the spectrum would be on myself, uncomfortable, getting infected. I don't mind if I get infected. I don't mind if I get sick. But I really don't want to end up in the hospital. That would be, you know, maybe one into the spectrum of a person's level of comfort, you know, how protected can I expect that I am having already had COVID-19? It's quite rare for somebody who has previously had COVID-19 to end up hospitalized. The numbers are so low, we can't even get good numbers still at this point. I think is what it is. But that you'd probably want to warn the person, you know, that look, even a non-hospitalized infection can be pretty serious, right? Long COVID issues have been present in people who don't get hospitalized. And I'd say another end of the spectrum would be somebody saying, no, I don't, I don't, I don't want to get sick at all, either because of the age category they're in, right, or underlying conditions, or just that they don't want to get infected and be passing it on to other people, right? Whether or not they themselves would be healthy, they don't want to risk their parent or grandparent or neighbor getting infected by them. So they really want, don't want to change their behavior unless they have a very high level of protection. Now what we're looking at is the very same graph that we saw before, except now with the booster. So instead of two shots of Moderna, we're looking at three shots specifically, instead of two shots of Pfizer, we're looking at three. And again, all of the other types of options that we talked about, and you can generally see the types of neutralization that we're looking at here. And specifically, how things go post-symptom onset or the last dose. We're actually seeing it holding up a little bit more and less of a reduction across the board. And this led to authors of the study to say, administration of a hemologus or heterologus booster based on the woo hand who won spike sequence, markedly increased neutralizing antibody titers and breadth against B-A1, B-A2, B-A2.1, 2.1, and B-A4.5 across all vaccines evaluated. Our data suggests that although Omicron sublinearges evade polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses elicited by primary vaccine series, vaccine boosters may provide sufficient protection against Omicron-induced severe disease. And for those of you who are interested, I list here the funding, but that's also available at the research article which will post and give you the link in the description below. Now, I've heard a lot of people ask the question regarding all of the spike protein stuff, is why do we formulate vaccines specifically against the spike protein? Something that is mutating so often, why don't we go against some other surface protein? Even a year ago, when we had Dr. Shane Croadion, he answered that question really well. So I will go ahead and refer to what Shane Croady says here. Why did both companies choose to use spike protein for their target for this vaccine? Right, so there are about 29 licensed human vaccines depending on how you count and almost all them work on the basis of protective antibody responses. And so when you're trying to move fast with vaccine development, the most obvious target is to try and make antibodies against the protein that's on the surface of the virus because antibodies work by binding to the surface of a virus and essentially covering the virus and keeping the virus from doing anything. That's really the simple way to think about antibodies working. And so for previous coronaviruses, it was known that there are a couple of different proteins on the surface of the virus. But it's really the spike protein that's the major one and probably the most important antibody target, and sure enough in the month subsequent to those decisions, lots of data have accumulated that have said essentially all of the neutralizing antibodies, the important antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are against the spike protein. So the spike protein is the best target to focus on for antibodies. And when I talked to you about, you know, there really being three parts of the immune system, one of the concerns has been that, well, sometimes antibodies aren't that great at stopping all viruses and then you really need the T cells to kick in. And the T cells don't necessarily recognize spike, they might recognize some of those other 25 proteins. And so that was actually our first major scientific study on COVID-19 was to ask and infected people. Do people make T cells that recognize spike also, more only other proteins? And what we found was that it infected people, actually people make a lot of T cell responses to spike also. And so that was a really, that was a good sign supporting the vaccine development at all, that if you are some viruses, you have to choose more than one protein. For this virus, it's to look like, yeah, just choosing one protein is a reasonable way to try and get antibody responses and T cell responses. So again, I thought this was a very interesting article as it answers a question that a lot of patients have been asking me, they understand that there are specific vaccines in development to attack the specific spike protein from the B-A-5 or Omicron variant. And that actually may be a good idea, it may improve what's going on. But the question is, should you wait for that to come out or should you take advantage of the boosters that are available now if you're interested in getting that type of protection? And in conjunction with the fact that we hear at Mekram follow the Swiss cheese model, which essentially says is that we're looking for anything that may be beneficial to protect people from getting disease and ending up in the hospital, whether that be improving their own innate immune system through natural means or taking advantage of the available vaccines to protect them. Then we're going to review the data and make that available for everyone, so they can make their own decision. And with that, I'd like to thank you for watching this video.

Can Vaccines Help with Long COVID?,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2022-02-25,70yn9vdW1iE,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. You know, in the clinic, I'm getting more and more referrals now for patients with long COVID symptoms. They're shorter breath after an infection that's just not getting better or they're having fatigue or they're just not feeling right. And I thought this paper was an interesting paper to review. This is a pre-print that's being evaluated for publication in the prestigious journal Nature and it's titled Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccination on the Symptoms of Patients with Long COVID, a target trial emulation using data from the COM-PA-REE cohort in France. And what this paper tries to do is answer the question, does vaccination help patients with long COVID symptoms? This paper received no financial assistance from pharmaceutical companies and there were no competing interests or financial associations listed in the publication. And the data that they use comes from the COM-PA-REE cohort, which is an ongoing nationwide e-cohort of patients with long COVID in France. And you can see the reference there and the website if you want to find out more about this research program. So this is what they did. They looked at the COM-PA-REE cohort and of course there are a number of patients in this cohort which they followed longitudinally. And the criteria to get into the study is that they had to have symptoms for at least three months and they had to have had at least one symptom that was persistent. And as subjects in the study got at least one shot of any vaccine in France and we'll talk more about that, they started to make up more and more of the intervention arm until finally they made up their intervention arm. And they had 455 subjects in this arm. Out of this cohort they looked at matched controls and of course they found unvaccinated because that was what was in the cohort and these served as the control group and because they were matched they of course had 455. In the intervention group, as soon as they received their first dose of whatever vaccine, that's when the clock started ticking. And just to be clear on which vaccinations these were the ones that were available in France. Pfizer was one of those that was available. As it turns out, 78.9 percent of this vaccinated intervention group had the Pfizer. In terms of the Moderna, it was about 10.3 percent of the group. There was the Johnson & Johnson or Janssen Pharmaceutical which was fairly small amount or 0.2 percent and then the AstraZeneca vaccine which was about 10.5 percent. And time zero for each individual is when the subject in the intervention arm gets vaccinated. And then what they did is they looked at 60 days and 120 days and they had them do a questionnaire. But they also had them do a tool of looking at COVID symptoms. So a question to look at that. And also the impact of these COVID symptoms as well. COVID symptoms as we'll see here in the report is known as an ST and the impact is known as an IT. So the major endpoint of this study was what percent of the cohort was free of any long COVID symptoms at the end of the study. And so when we looked at the vaccinated intervention group up here, the number that it turned out to be was 16.6 percent. So 16.6 percent of this vaccinated cohort was completely symptom free at the end after they had their vaccination. Whereas in the unvaccinated control, that number was 7.5 percent. That's a difference of 9.1 percent or an absolute risk reduction of 9.1 percent. And this was statistically significant. Now let's look at the data in tabulated form. You can see here that the vaccinated patients here in the middle column and the unvaccinated patients here in the far right column, pretty much the same median age. You can see that in both cases, the majority of the subjects were female. And for the most part, they were well matched. You can see that in terms of confirmed COVID-19 infections, the time from symptom onset to admission, hospitalization, and ICU hospitalization, and the severity of long COVID at baseline also were pretty well matched. As you can see here for the primary endpoint, the remission of long COVID by 120 days. And you can see here that was 16.6 percent in the vaccinated group, 7.5 percent in the unvaccinated group with the risk difference at 9.1. And you can tell here by the 95 percent confidence interval that this was statistically significant. In terms of this ST score, which of course is the symptom score and the IT, which is the impact score, you can also see here that there was a significant difference between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated controls with the vaccinated patients in both categories having statistically significantly lower scores, which is better from a long COVID stance. In the last category, proportion of patients with a long COVID IT score greater than past at 120 days. Past stands for the patient acceptable symptom state. And so what we're looking for here is a lower number, which we did see here with vaccinated patients versus unvaccinated, but it was just shy of statistical significance. So since we've talked about efficacy in this case, let's talk about serious adverse events. And we can see those listed here in the vaccinated group. There was one patient with a deep venous thrombosis, which was hospitalized, another of suspicion of pulmonary embolism with urgent referral to the emergency room. But the most common was the relapse of long COVID symptoms, which made up less than 3 percent of the cohort. Couple things to remember here is that all of these patients have COVID-19 and had long symptoms as a result of it. So it's unclear how many of these side effects are related to vaccination because we don't have the list in the control group. I think that would have been nice to have in this study. So the authors also talk about some of the limitations. Of course, the big limitation here is that it's not randomized. The patients in the cohort were allowed to select for themselves, which ones would be vaccinated. While it's possible that there could have been some motivational factors involved in terms of who got the vaccine and who didn't. It's unclear whether or not that would have had an impact in this case. The other limitation had to do with timing. Of course, the timing of onset for the intervention group is obvious in terms of when they got vaccination. However, by simply assigning that same date to their match control, there may have been an issue in terms of allowing time to pass in exactly the same way for the match control. They say here at the bottom to account for variation in outcome measurement times, we explored how time since vaccination affected the study outcome and found no evidence of an interaction between baseline and time of vaccination on the patient's symptoms and impact. And that's actually included in the supplemental material in the submitted study. Here's why I think it's an interesting study. If people's immune systems are not up to par and this allows them to not only get infected with SARS-CoV-2, but also have long symptoms from it, it's certainly possible that this subgroup of population might have an increased prevalence of subpar immune systems that potentially could be allowing the virus to hang out in a reservoir or at least the proteins of which to hang out and continue to have low-grade symptoms without the immune system doing what it needs to do to get rid of the remnants of the infection. Remember in one of our previous videos where we talked about vitamin D deficiency and long COVID-19, there was a young girl who had persistent symptoms for over three months in her GI tract and when they did the colonoscopy and biopsy, they found remnants of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Is it possible that vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines is just what the immune system needs in this situation to boost up and to finally clear out the remnants of the infection that are still causing the ongoing symptoms? It would seem here that with an absolute risk reduction of 9.1, that would mean that you would need to treat about 11 patients with long COVID symptoms with vaccination to have one of them completely symptom-free. Of course a randomized placebo-controlled trial would be best in terms of determining whether or not this was the case, but it's becoming more and more difficult to do that kind of a study, especially in the West where the proportion of the population who has been vaccinated is increasing."
"COVID Vaccines VS Delta Variant: State of Texas Study (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson)",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-11-15,JWMkeMA3sfA,"Welcome to another Meg Kram COVID-19 update. As we head into the winter months, we're going to take stock about what's going on with the COVID-19 pandemic, look at a couple of countries specifically the United States and Russia. But first let's take a look at the world and let's see what's going on here. Here we have new cases per million and we can see here that things are starting to be on the rise. Whereas deaths per million seem to be leveling off. And sometimes there is a delay between cases and deaths, something to keep an eye on. When we look at testing for COVID-19 per 1,000 people, we can see here that between Russia and the United States, there are around three to four COVID-19 tests per 1,000 people in both countries. So I think we can compare them in terms of the number of cases. If we look at new cases per million, we can see here in red that the United States is just getting over its Delta wave and cases were on the way down but seem to be leveling off here and maybe turning in the other direction. Whereas clearly over the last few months here in Russia, the number of cases have gone up to actually a higher case per million than in the United States. And here if we look at new deaths per 1 million, we can see here that in the United States there has been a decline in those deaths. And in Russia, we're seeing that things have never been worse in terms of deaths per million from the pandemic. So our world in data is showing that despite the similar case rate that we see here, a little over 200 cases per million, there is a much higher death rate, almost twice as high in Russia as in the United States. And there could be several reasons for that. There have been new therapeutics that have been introduced. Also if we look at the proportion of the population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in those countries, there is a disparity there as well. And in California, the Delta wave that we just recently had was about a third of the peak that we had earlier this year in January in terms of daily new cases and in terms of daily deaths, it was even smaller than that. And this seems to be the case for most of the states of the union. The daily deaths of the Delta variant was smaller than that of the deaths earlier this year back in January. And many have attributed that to the efficacy of the vaccine at preventing deaths. One notable exception to this rule was Texas, which had a very similar size in the Delta variant that it did earlier this year in December and January. Also notable was the amount of deaths that occurred from the Delta variant just recently in Texas. And the most recent wave that is made up predominantly of the Delta variant seems to be dropping at this time. And as recording here in early November, 61 percent of the people in the state of Texas have received that least one dose and 53 percent of the people in Texas have been fully vaccinated. There's been some new light on just exactly how efficacious the vaccines have become based on a study that's been put out by the Texas Department of State Health Services. On November 8, 2021, the Texas Department of State Health Services published this report titled COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status. So this is not a study that is sponsored by the CDC or a study that was sponsored by any pharmaceutical corporation. This is the state of Texas looking internally as to what's going on in their state regarding infections and deaths and vaccine status. So this was a real world study looking at real world data. And the places that they looked for it was number one, they looked at electronic laboratory reporting systems for the ELRS. And this was linked data so they could find positive SARS, COVID-2 data, either using PCR or antigen tests. The second bit of data that they found was with the vital records. And this is so that they can confirm death certificates from COVID. Finally, they were also able to tap into the immune registry to see who got vaccinated. From any of the three authorized vaccines in the United States. And because all of this data was linked, they wanted to know the question of all the people who have died or who have gotten infections, which ones were vaccinated and which ones were not vaccinated. And they started looking at this on January 15, 2021, because that would be the first day that anybody in Texas would be completely vaccinated. And they took that analysis to October 1, 2021, which is when they had the data from. And as we look at the data, what you'll see is they did two types of analysis. They looked at from January all the way through October and they looked at September to October. And the reason why they wanted to look at September to October was because the Delta variant was predominant during this period. And they wanted to specifically look at this period to see what vaccine efficacy was. And so we're going to look at that. We're going to look at data in terms of infections and what vaccine status had on infections. And we're going to look at deaths to see what kind of effect vaccine status had on deaths. And then we're going to look at it throughout the entire time period in Texas and also with respect to when there was the Delta variant. And then of course we can look at subgroup analyses in terms of age groups, etc. Okay, so let's take a look at the data. So the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to split the screen and we're going to look at infections on one side. And we're going to look at deaths on the other side. In terms of the number of PCR positive and antigen positive subjects in the study, there was 1,545,390 infections. That was split out into three different groups. There was those that were unvaxed and that was 1,314,337. There were those that were partially vaxed and that was 184,732. And then there were those that were fully vaxed. And that was 46,321. In terms of percentages, this was 85 percent of the total. This was 12 percent of the total and this was 3 percent of the total. Now if we look at age groups from the 18 to 29 year old group, that made up the largest bulk which was 24.3 percent. So interestingly, this young age group made up the majority of these cases or these infections. The next most plentiful was the 30 to 39 age group and that made up 19.7 percent. And then finally, the 50 to 64 year old group made up 17.7 percent. Now if you look at this, the average age of this group was 39 years of age, which is pretty young when you consider that this was a very wide ranging group. Males made up 47 percent of these infections, females made up 52 percent, and the additional 1 percent was unknown. So let's take a look at the data here in the actual publication. We're looking at cases or infections and the time period is all the way from January to October 1st, 2021. And you can see here that they have adjusted the case rate by vaccination status at the rate per 100,000 people. And what they found that in the unvaccinated people, there was a 14,196.6 per 100,000 rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections, as opposed to 315.9 per 100,000 people. And that goes to in terms of the difference, a 45 fold increase risk of coming down with SARS-CoV-2, if you're unvaccinated in Texas from January 15 to October 1st, 2021. Now what's even more interesting is when you break it down by age, and we're looking from January all the way to October. And what you'll notice here is that there is a considerable difference across all age groups, but notice that in the youngest 12 to 17 year old age group, there was the highest difference in terms of infections in unvaccinated versus vaccinated. In other words, according to this data, the vaccines were the most effective at reducing infection in the 12 to 17 year old age group. Now when we just look at September to October, so we're looking predominantly at the Delta variant at this point, and we look at it instead of it being 45 times difference, because we know the Delta variant was a little bit more resistant to the vaccines, and by resistance, simply that the vaccine efficacy with respect to preventing infections was lower. And the Delta variant was more likely to cause symptomatic breakthrough infections than the other previous variants that we've seen. Here it's only 13 times higher in unvaccinated people. And once again, let's take a look at the age groups. And what we see here is that the highest efficacy of the vaccine in terms of reducing infections is once again in the 12 to 17 year old age group, where it is 22 times different in the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated. And once again, this data comes from the state of Texas. And here's a graph depicting the cases with case rate per 100,000 population on the Y axis, and of course time from January of this year going all the way to the first of October here on the right. And the blue line is the case rate per 100,000 population of the unvaccinated in Texas versus the red line here at the bottom, which is the fully vaccinated. So if you notice towards the end there, it was 13 times higher. And even though the blue is considerably above the red there, it's only 13 times higher than the red, whereas when the amount of infections were relatively low, this blue line was 45 times higher than that red line, which is almost right on the baseline. So what about deaths? Well, they use the vital statistics of the state of Texas to show that the amount of deaths was 28,659. Now again, we'll split those up into their components and then and do the analysis. So for the unvaxed, there was 24,517. For the partially vaxed, there was 1942. And then for the fully vaxed, there was 2220. And the percentages here was 85.5 percent for the unvaxed, 6.8 percent for the partially vaxed, and 7.7 percent for the fully vaxed. So the average age was 67 years of age, and that's for all the people that died in this cohort. And if you'll notice that the fully vaxed was at 7.7 percent, and the partially vax was 6.8 percent. While there are a lot of confounders that may go into that calculation, it's unclear if those numbers were statistically significantly different. If they had vaccinated the older age group, like we know that they did early on, and allowed the younger groups to be vaccinated as they went along, it might set up a situation where the fully vaxed would be much older than the partially vaxed. Of course, that is purely speculation at this point. Nevertheless, in this cohort, the males represented 58 percent of the cohort with females representing 41 percent. And once again, if you break it down by age, the 75 plus age group represented 35 percent of the deaths, whereas the 65 to 74 year old age group was 25.1 percent. So you can see here clearly that in terms of infections, the younger you are, the more likely you are to become infected, but the older you are, the more likely you are to die. But clearly, it wasn't people greater than 80 that were exclusively dying of COVID-19. 25 percent of the deaths were in the 65 to 74 year old age group. And of course, if you add these up, fully 40 percent of the deaths were in those less than the age of 65. So now we're going to do what we did for the infections and look at the age breakdown for the age-adjusted death rates. And again, we're going back to January 15 to October 1 of 2021. And what we can see here is that there is a 40 times higher rate of death in the unvaccinated cohort versus the vaccinated cohort. And as you can see, the vaccines had their highest efficacy in the 18 to 29 year old age group with a 99 times higher rate of death in those that were unvaccinated. And they've listed here less than 10 because there were so few patients in that group. They did not want to specifically name the number because of privacy concerns, but just realized that there was less than 10 in the number of fully vaccinated COVID-19 associated deaths in the 18 to 29 year group. Whereas those in the unvaccinated was 339. But you can see that across the board, these numbers were significantly high. Now let's look at the death rate from September 4 to October 1, 2021. And this is going to include more of the Delta variant. And as we expected, the number is high, but it's not as high. It's 20 times higher death rate for those that are not vaccinated in the state of Texas. And when we look at the vaccine efficacy at preventing deaths in September to October, we can see once again that the numbers are high across the board regardless of age. And once again, the efficacy in the 18 to 29 year old age group is in this case the second highest in the cohort. What about death rate and the graph? Once again, we have the death rate here per 100,000 population on the Y axis. And we have time starting in January on the X axis. Blue are the unvaccinated and red are the fully vaccinated. And you can see here graphically what these numbers have been telling us. Now the last bit of information from this study, it's looking at the behavior of the SARS-CoV-2 virus before the Delta variant was predominant as it says here in late June versus after it was predominant, which was in late June. And so if we look at that is the Delta variant more infectious, is it more virulence? Is it more likely to put you into the hospital or even cause you to die? And what this study found in the state of Texas was that as opposed to in April of 2021 versus August of 2021 when the Delta variant was much more prevalent, there was a four times higher risk of infection after the Delta variant became the predominant strain. So clearly the Delta variant was more successful at causing infections. However, when we looked at deaths and there's been some discrepancy here, the question is whether or not the Delta variant is more deadly or not. What they found here was in comparison to April versus August, there was a five times higher rate of death associated with the Delta variant. And this seems to lead to other research that has been done that shows credence in the idea that the Delta variant is not only more infectious, but it is more deadly. The other possibility is that of course the vaccines are waning in their efficacy and that could be the reason why we're seeing these shift in numbers. And this article also states the highest proportion of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 associated deaths were among unvaccinated people compared with those who were fully or partially vaccinated. And here's the important part. Over time, however, as more and more people get vaccinated, the proportion of cases and deaths among vaccinated people is expected to rise. And you can imagine that if the extreme example of 100 percent of people were vaccinated, you wouldn't see any unvaccinated people in the hospital, even though we know that the vaccine is not 100 percent effective and they're always going to be some people, even if it's a few. And so that's the thing that you have to understand. They demonstrate that here when you look at January 15 to October 1 of 2021, you can see that whereas the fully vaccinated people only made up 3 percent of the cases and the unvaccinated made up 85 percent of the cases. However, if you look just towards the end, when more and more people are becoming vaccinated, that 3 percent jumps to 8.4 percent and the 85 percent drops down to 72 percent of cases. Same thing is happening with deaths as well. We have 7.7, fully vaccinated, going to 13.7 percent of cases. This doesn't mean that the vaccine necessarily is working less, although that certainly could be the case. What it goes to show is that because more and more of the population is becoming vaccinated, we would expect to see more and more of those being hospitalized to also be vaccinated, even though there wouldn't be a drop in the efficacy of the vaccine. It's just based on population and statistics. And if you're interested to know more about the methods, data sources, definitions, timeframes, linking methods, rate calculations, and limitations of this study, please go to the description below where we will put the link to this study. I think this is an important study because it shows real world data and it's coming from a state government that doesn't endorse vaccine or mask mandates. This means that they are trying to encourage vaccination based on data and based on the benefits of the vaccines. They state here in the background, real world states specific data showing the impact of vaccination on outcomes, including infection and death can help illustrate these benefits, improve confidence in vaccines, and raise vaccination rates in Texas. And given the fact that we're starting to see a rise in infection rates across the country and the world, I hope they are successful.

AstraZeneca Second Doses vs Moderna and Pfizer COVID Vaccines,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-11-10,5Lj3sf97vL4,"Welcome to another Meg Cram COVID-19 update. We're going to talk about the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, otherwise known as COVID Shield, or VAX Evrea, which is a vaccine product that is not available in the United States, but is available in several countries around the world, and it is a product of AstraZeneca and Oxford University. For those of you who don't know, it is similar to the Johnson & Johnson Janssen Pharmaceuticals vaccine in that it uses a vector from an adenovirus, in this case it's a chimpanzee adenovirus, and we have a video that goes over all of this if you want some more background on this information. What we're going to do here in this video is update you on what's happened since this has been approved in several countries and what is the evidence of its efficacy and what's going on right now in terms of the latest research and development. And this data was taken from a couple of publications, one specifically that was published in the Lancet, that looked at data from Scotland, and represented about 99 percent of the Scottish population at 5.4 million people. And the other one was a retrospective study that was published on a preprint server that has not been peer reviewed, but evaluated in a retrospective cohort, the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In terms of the efficacy of this vaccine, as you can see for the alpha variant, there was an 86 percent efficacy against hospitalization in the alpha variant. In the gamma variant, it was 87 percent effective, and in the delta variant, up to 92 percent effective at preventing hospitalization after the second dose. Not much data was reported for the beta variant, which was the primary variant early on in 2021 in South Africa. For the delta variant, though, the prevention after the second dose of symptomatic infection was only 61 percent. One of the issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine early on that was discovered in about March of 2021 was the issue of blood clots. Similar to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, this caused a pausing of these vaccine campaigns in many countries in Europe. And you can see that today, even there are a number of countries where usage has stopped, for instance, in Norway, and also in South Africa. Other countries have limited AstraZeneca to higher risk populations like the elderly. And that is because of the European Medicines Agency finding, and the European Medicines Agency is the agency in charge of the evaluation and supervision of medicinal products in Europe. The known risks of this vaccine is that there are unusual blood clots associated with it, with low platelets, which are estimated to occur in one in 100,000 vaccinated people. And so as a result of this, there were a number of people earlier in 2021 that got the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but did not get the second dose because of the pausing. This opened up an interesting and unique opportunity to see what would happen if these subjects with the first dose being AstraZeneca had a different type of COVID vaccine, for instance, an mRNA vaccine as their second shot. And as it turns out, there have been a number of studies that have looked at this, and the results are interesting. This paper, which was published in the Lancet on the 18th of October 2021, looked at the effectiveness in different groups of vaccines in Sweden. They looked at those who got the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by the Moderna vaccine or the Pfizer vaccine or another dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. And of course, we'll put a link in the description below. The three groups were the AstraZeneca vaccine first, coupled with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In the NAC group, there was 94,569 people. In the AstraZeneca Moderna group, there was 16,400 and two. And then finally, the last group was the AstraZeneca AstraZeneca, in which there was 430,100. So you can see here, the first dose is always AstraZeneca, and the second dose is changed up. And the endpoint that they were looking at here was symptomatic COVID-19 infection. So the number that they came up with for the AstraZeneca Pfizer was 67 percent effectiveness with a 95 percent confidence interval of 59 percent to 73 percent. For the AstraZeneca Moderna, they came up with in the calculation 79 percent effectiveness or efficacy, with 62 percent to 88 percent 95 percent confidence interval. And then finally, the AstraZeneca, they found to be at 50 percent, with a 95 percent confidence interval of 41 to 58 percent. Now, if they combined this, as these are the different second dose to the first, or heterologous, they found that the effectiveness or the efficacy here was 68 percent, with a 95 percent confidence interval of 61 to 74 percent. So how did this change the evidence? We have known, based on studies that have been done before, that adding the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine to the AstraZeneca vaccine elicits a stronger immune response compared to a homologous AstraZeneca AstraZeneca vaccine schedule. However, what we didn't know up to this point was whether or not that translated into a better efficacy for the vaccine. So just to be clear on that point, higher antibody levels doesn't necessarily correlate to better immunity from the vaccine. And while high antibody levels is a good sign, what we really need to see to prove efficacy is a trial in the real world. So as the authors state, in this study, the heterologous COVID-19 vaccination using the AstraZeneca vaccine as the first dose, followed by either the Pfizer-Biontech or the Moderna as the second dose was associated with a 67 to 79 percent effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 infection. And of course, this was significantly higher than the 50 percent effectiveness from the homologous vaccination schedule using just AstraZeneca for the first and the second dose. I just wanted you to be aware that the current vaccine from AstraZeneca for COVID-19 is officially known as AZD1222. But currently AstraZeneca is in phase two and phase three trials on a brand new vaccine known as AZD2816. And this has a different spike protein. And it is modeled after the beta variant, which is known as the B1351 that was seen in South Africa. So I hope you found that this was helpful.

Coronavirus Vaccines vs. NON COVID-19 related deaths (New Data),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-11-09,zkVsXOZguLg,"Welcome to another Meg Cram COVID-19 update. Now there have been a lot of studies looking at the US population and what has happened over the last year in terms of what proportion of the population has experienced mortality from COVID-19. And of course there's also non-COVID-19 mortality occurring as well. And during the vaccine campaign we've had a number of vaccines such as Pfizer, Moderna, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which according to a number of studies have reduced infections, hospitalizations, and even death from COVID-19. A question that really hasn't been answered up to this point however is what is the effect of the vaccines on non-COVID-19 mortality? This question has been raised a number of times indirectly as to the question of yes, these vaccines may be preventing COVID-19 mortality because they reduce hospitalizations and infections. But if they're causing significant side effects, is it possible that these vaccines could be potentially increasing non-COVID-19 mortality? As of September 21 of 2021, there have been 182 million people that have been fully vaccinated. In the United States either from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Is there any data that answers the question as to what these vaccines are doing to non-COVID-19 mortality in different populations? And for the first time we actually have some data that has just been published on October 22, 2021 from the CDC, in an article titled COVID-19 Vaccination and Non-COVID-19 Mortality Risk, seven integrated healthcare organizations, United States, December 14, 2020 to July 31, 2021. So what this study did is it looked at seven different integrated healthcare organizations, and these integrated institutions are outpatient clinics or hospital organizations typically with an electronic medical record to track the patients and looked at a total of about 11 million subjects in this study. So this is a fairly large study. Actually, it was about 3 percent of the entire United States population. So it's a very robust study in terms of numbers. And it looked at the folks that had the Pfizer vaccine, and there was about 3.5 million with controls. And remember, controls are simply the group that we're comparing the intervention to. We'll talk a little bit more about that. It looked at those who had the Moderna vaccine, and there was about 2.6 million of those. And then finally, it looked at those with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and there was about 342,000 of those with controls. So one of the things about the J&J vaccine is because it was given emergency use authorization. Months after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were given emergency use authorization, they had to come up with different control groups. So they wanted to make sure that the controls that they matched with each of these vaccines were contemporaneous or at the same time that these J&J and Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were rolled out. Now the other thing that you should understand is that whenever you're doing a comparison in this type of a situation and you're looking at vaccines, people who take vaccines don't typically also engage in risky behavior. And that of course could lead to non-COVID mortality. They wanted to make sure that they had the same type of people in the control groups. And so one of the entry criteria to become a control in this study was that they have had to have taken the flu vaccine at least once in the last two years. This would eliminate those people that never would have had a vaccine just because of their typical behavior. And of course the endpoint in this study was non-COVID-related deaths. This is important because there's a conception out there that the vaccines may be reducing deaths from COVID-19, reducing infections, but they may be causing side effects that could be causing increases in other things or maybe even deaths that aren't related to COVID, non-COVID-related deaths in other words. And so that's why this study is really important. So we're going to get through the data. We're going to talk about some of the confounders and some of the limitations of the study. But I want you to stick with me as we go through this because this is really an important topic to tackle in terms of the reported deaths on the VIERS and other things as well. And as a spoiler alert, we're going to see here that non-COVID-related deaths are actually lower in the vaccine groups. And we're going to talk about how they did that. And for that, they looked into seven integrated healthcare organizations with something called a VSD, a vaccine safety data link, which reports not only hospital-related deaths, but also deaths reported to the health plans. One of the other entrance criteria or exclusion criteria is that the death had to be outside of 30 days from either a SARS-CoV-2 test positivity or COVID-19 illness. OK, and here's some of the data from that table. We're looking at the subjects in these groups. So let's take a look at them just briefly. We have the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine here, and we have the Moderna vaccine recipients here. And here is the unvaccinated control comparison group in this situation. So total, there was about 3.4 million of the Pfizer-BioNTech participants. There's about 2.6 million Moderna vaccine recipients. And then here is the control group for both of those. Because Janssen rolled out later, there is about 342,000 enrolled in that group. And there was about 1.3 million unvaccinated comparison group that was later on. And now what we have is the age groups of these groups. As we can see here, 12 to 17, 18, 44, 45 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84. And you can see here that these are fairly large groups. So for instance, in the 12 to 17 year group, there was 316,000 enrolled in the Pfizer-BioNTech group. And of course, because the Moderna and the Janssen and Janssen vaccine are not given emergency use authorization for the 12 to 17 year group, we do not have data for those groups. There was close parity between male and female across the enrollment group. With in the mRNA vaccines, there seemed to be a slight pretelection for female enrollment and the opposite in the Janssen Pharmaceutical or the Janssen and Janssen vaccine group. And I also want you to notice that with respect to race and ethnicity, this was a pretty well-balanced study with good representation from many ethnic groups. Okay, let's take a look now at the deaths in these groups based on the reporting from our pre-A4 mentioned criteria. So again, these are deaths that did not occur within a 30-day window of people turning positive for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. Those are excluded because this is non-COVID-19 mortality. And it was reported from the VSD or the Vaccine Safety Data Link from seven very large integrated healthcare organizations representing about 3 percent of the entire population of the United States or 11 million. And these are being reported as in the first number, the total number and in the parentheses, the standardized mortality rate per 100 person years. And so when you're comparing these groups, it's important to compare the number in the parentheses. And a 100 person years is basically the amount of time and the amount of people over which you would see the following data. If you took 100 people for a year or if you took one person for 100 years or if you had for instance 10 people over 10 years of time, this is the amount of deaths you would see with that kind of a denominator. It's just simply a way of normalizing the data. And so here are the results. Again, because the Moderna vaccine was not given emergency use authorization for the 12 to 17-year-old age group, we do not have data for that or for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. When they do this, they look at what the death rate per 100 person years is after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, after the second dose, after the Pfizer-BioNTech, after the first dose of the Moderna, after the second dose of the Moderna, and of course after the single dose of the Johnson and Johnson or the Johnson vaccine. And we can see here, overall, that after the first dose, there's a total of 1,157 deaths or an adjusted mortality rate per 100 person years of 0.42. And we see here the number after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech. We see here 1,202 after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, and we see 4,434 after the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. There was 6,660 total deaths in the unvaccinated comparison group or a standardized mortality rate per 100 person years of 1.11. And in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine recipients, a total of 671 for that. And in the unvaccinated comparison group, 2,219. And so you can see here the breakout for all of the different age groups after the first and second doses of the Pfizer, after the first and second doses of the Moderna, and of course for the unvaccinated comparison group. For the vaccine recipients for Johnson and Johnson, you can see that here with the rest of the age breakdown and of course for their own control group. Again, they have their own control group because they rolled out later and they wanted to have a control group just for them. So again, just to be clear, the number here is the total number of deaths and the number in parentheses is the number of deaths per 100 person years. So it gives us a little bit of insight into what is happening according to again. This is non-COVID mortality. Again, let me repeat this. This is non-COVID mortality. So if we look for instance at this unvaccinated group, 12 to 17 years of age just following these patients along, unfortunately, 7 of these individuals died from something not related to COVID whatsoever. And from the 18 to 44 group, 161 died. In the 45 to 64 year group, 910 and so forth, 147, 1861, and then finally in the greater than 85 year age group, 2314. That is the unvaccinated comparison group. When we look at the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine recipients, we can see how many people died from non-COVID-related deaths in these groups. These are like coronary artery disease, heart attacks, accidents, strokes, anything but COVID-19. We can see here the difference between male and female. And we can see the difference here in the race and ethnicities. So the point being is once we have this raw data, we can then compare them to each other. So we can compare the Pfizer-Biontech recipients to the control recipients to see if there is a reduction in non-COVID-19 mortality. And that's exactly what this table is showing. Now the thing that you have to understand is when you compare two groups to each other, there may be a difference in the average of those two groups depending on what you're measuring. But the question is, how do we know that difference is real? We know that that difference is real based on something called a 95 percent confidence interval. And that's what you're seeing here in these confidence intervals, here and here, and actually anywhere you see on the page, these two brackets, what you're seeing in between them is the range that we believe the real value exists with 95 percent confidence. Now because this is a relative risk number, it's important to understand that if this range that you're seeing here in this 95 percent confidence interval includes the number one, then you really can't tell whether or not there is an increase or decrease risk at all. In other words, if the range is completely less than one, as it is here, in this first one that we're looking at, 0.38 to 0.44, the map means that the number one is the number is outside that range. And we can say that the relative risk here is lower. And so what this would mean is if we look at those people who took the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, after dose one, we could then say that they had a lower mortality, non-COVID-19 mortality, than the control group that was put in this study. After the second dose, it also seems to show that again, there was a lower relative risk of dying from non-COVID-related causes if the patient got a vaccine. And that went across the board for not just Pfizer-BioNTech, but also Moderna, and also the Janssen Pharmaceutical product as well. In fact, in all of these confidence intervals, they all did not include the number one except for the Pfizer-BioNTech-age intervals for those between the ages of 12 and 17. So because of that, we really can't say whether or not the vaccine increased the risk or decreased the risk of non-COVID-19-related illnesses or deaths in this case. But for all other age groups, we can say that there was, based on this statistics, a reduction in non-COVID-19-related mortality in those who took the vaccine. The other thing that's notable is we look at the averages here for the Janssen Pharmaceuticals. We see that the numbers here are in the 40s to 50s to 60s, whereas when we look at the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech, that those numbers seem to be generally speaking in the 20s to 30s. So the question is, is why would the vaccine cause a reduction in the non-COVID-19 mortality in these recipients? And the thing that you've got to understand is that this is an observational study. So we really can't put together causation here. And secondly, I think the explanation is clear once we read the author's discussion. And I think this paragraph here is very important to read and understand. It states here that in a cohort of 6.4 million COVID-19 vaccines and 4.6 million demographically similar unvaccinated persons, recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna or Janssen vaccines had lower non-COVID-19 mortality risk than did the unvaccinated comparison groups. Then they go on to say why they think this is the case. There is no increased risk for mortality among COVID-19 vaccine recipients. That's an important statement to answer the question about whether or not there is an increase in mortality that we're missing in patients who get the vaccine and we're only measuring COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths and seeing a reduction there. So this answers in a very important question. Is the vaccine causing deaths elsewhere that we may not be picking up? And again, here is their conclusion that there is no increased risk for mortality among COVID-19 vaccine recipients. But why would it be lower? And they answer this in the next sentence. This finding reinforces the safety profile of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. The lower mortality risk after COVID-19 vaccination suggests substantial, healthy, vaccinate effects. I.e. Vaccinated persons tend to be healthier than unvaccinated persons. And here's the key. Even though as part of the entry criteria for the control group, those subjects had to have had at least one flu shot in the last two years, they may not have completely taken care of that confounder and there may be a healthy, vaccinate effect in this population. They do say that they're going to explore that in future analyses. They further go on to state that mortality rates among Janssen vaccine recipients were not as low as those among mRNA vaccine recipients. This finding might be because of differences in risk factors such as underlying health status and risk behaviors among recipients of mRNA and Janssen vaccines that might also be associated with mortality risk. Now the authors of this study do state that there are at least four limitations of this study. We mentioned this. The study was observational. And of course, there's always going to be confounders at the individual level. Second, that the healthy, vaccinate effects were found in all, but the youngest age group. We go on further to state that lower rates of non-COVID-19 mortality in vaccinated groups suggest that the COVID-19 vaccineees are inherently healthier or engage in fewer risk behaviors. The third limitation is that even though COVID-19 deaths were excluded, the cause of deaths were actually not assessed. And of course, finally, this was in 3 percent of the population and it may not be completely generalizable to the entire US population. However, despite these limitations, the authors felt that this study had several strengths. The first one was that this is a very large cohort that looked at a very wide socio-demographically diverse population. And it also incorporated a study period of greater than seven months. And secondly, these VSDs or these vaccine safety data links were able to assess vaccination records outside of their systems that would normally not happen. Third, the assignment of index dates to the people being vaccinated allowed for the elimination of something called the immortal time bias. So this is basically caused when a cohort study is designed so that the follow-up includes a period of time where the participants in the exposed group cannot experience the outcome of, in this case, death. And so it appears as though they are immortal. And apparently allowing the assignment of these index dates helped prevent that from happening in this study. I think that this study is important to understand because it answers the question about something that a lot of people have asked and that is, are these vaccines really safe? And I can tell you, for me, who's worked in an intensive care unit during this pandemic early on, and when we were seeing three to 400,000 daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, we were adding patients to a expanded intensive care unit at our hospital. But when that came down and we started to vaccinate three to four million people a day, we had contracted down our ICU services back to just one ICU. We were hardly seeing any type of admissions for COVID-19, but more specifically to the point of this paper, we weren't seeing increased admissions for unknown causes or for non-COVID-19 causes. And then when the Delta variant hit in July and August, cases spiked once again and we had to reopen another floor again to contain those patients being admitted to the hospital for COVID-19. So in my own view, I could see that there was a correlation between hospitalization and deaths and the number of COVID-19 cases, but not an association with the amount of vaccination that we were doing in the state and also in the country. I can tell you personally that all of the patients that I took care of in that intensive care unit during the Delta wave were unvaccinated. It also confirms for me what our thoughts were on the increased amount of reported deaths in the VA ERS system as being a stimulated reporting mechanism. And for those of you who haven't watched our video with Rhonda Patrick going over questions and concerns on vaccines, we addressed this issue with stimulated reporting in the VA ERS system. Remember at this point here that reports were mandated to be made if there was any sort of death, even if the reporter of the death did not think that the death was related to the vaccine. We also showed in the article that was published by Morrow that there was during the 2009-2010 season, a very high level of reporting that occurred alongside with the fact that there was a lot of vaccination coverage that year. However, even though the vaccine coverage remained high, the amount of reports dropped down considerably. This was shown to be likely because of the amount of interest in the H1N1 virus in 2009 and 2010, as you can see here, that the amount of interest as measured on Google Trends seems to have the same shape as the reporting as well. And this led the authors of that study to conclude that the peak in the number of pregnancy reports observed during the 2009 and 2010 year, followed by a decrease in reporting suggests that the 2009 spike in pregnancy reports after 2009 H1N1 inactivated vaccines may have been due to stimulated reporting. And of course today, if you were to Google Trend the COVID vaccine, you would see a very similar increase in reporting along with the interest in the vaccine. And earlier this year, we did a calculation that showed that in the United States, typically in any 100,000 people over a year period of time, there's about 869.7 people that die as an average. And then if we looked over the seven-month period of vaccination that we had done at that time, there was 166 million people at that time that were vaccinated. And over a seven-month period of time, that would give us an average of three and a half months. Over a 12-month pro-ration, we came up to a number of about 421,000 people that should have been dead just based on chance alone at getting this many vaccinations. And so at the time, there was much less than that, and we believe that that was related to significant underreporting. But we couldn't be absolutely sure without further data. I believe that this paper has given us the data points that have enabled us to make that assessment with more confidence. Please look in the description below for the link to this article.

Which COVID Vaccine Booster is Best? Pfizer vs. Moderna vs. J. Johnson (Update 137),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-10-27,YhMlZczq4Ns,"Welcome to another Meg Cram COVID-19 update. Here's the question that everyone seems to be asking, and that is, which booster should I take? Well in true Meg Cram form, we're going to look at the data and make a decision. Recently, there's been a study that's come out that has not been published or peer review, but is on this pre-print server that was conducted by a number of experienced researchers out of a number of universities across the country, and also in medical schools across the country, including the NIH, and also major hospital systems like Kaiser Permanente. And this study was performed in the United States, and it looks at just that question. So it takes a look at people who have been vaccinated with Moderna, people who have been vaccinated with Johnson and Johnson, and people who have been vaccinated with Pfizer, and they waited about 12 weeks, and they randomized them to receive a Moderna booster, a Johnson and Johnson booster, and a Pfizer booster in each one of these categories. There were about 50 in each of these groups, and they split it evenly so that 25 in each group was less than the age of 55, and 25 were greater than the age of 55. And as it turns out, there was 154 in the Moderna group, 150 in the Johnson and Johnson group, and 154 in the Pfizer group, so total of 458 subjects in this study. And what these scientists wanted to ask is, what was the safety data like for each one of these categories, and what was the efficacy data like in terms of the ability to mount an antibody response? Well, let's take a look at the data. So let's look first at the safety data. And what we see here is we see the cohort that had Johnson and Johnson as the original vaccination, and then were boosted with the Moderna vaccine. But notice that in this study, they use the full dose Moderna vaccine because that's what they had available to them. Currently though, if you were to go and get a booster shot with the Moderna vaccine, you would get the 50 microgram dose, or what is known as the half dose. Be aware of that. Moderna is the only one out of these three that have reduced the dosages for the booster shot. Also notice that there are three different colors here in terms of the graph. There is the light, which is mild. There is the darker, which is the amount of moderate reaction, and then there is the darkest, which is the most severe. So what we're going to do is we're going to look back and forth here at the different slides, because if you have had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, we want to see how these side effect profiles look if you were to have the Moderna vaccine, if you were to have the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as a booster, or if you were to have the Pfizer vaccine as a booster. This is what it looks like here. If you focus on this first box, is if you were Johnson and Johnson getting the Moderna booster. And this is what it would look like if you had Johnson and Johnson and gotten the Johnson and Johnson booster again as the second shot. You can see that there are a little bit more severe reactions here, under malaise or fatigue. And the amount of pain and tenderness at the local site has gone up just a little bit, which is perfectly normal and acceptable for a vaccine side effect. And let's also remember that a lot of these symptoms are the results of the immune response that we're hoping to get with the vaccines in the first place. And here is the boosting with the Pfizer vaccine. You can see a little bit less in the way of severity, but still a little bit on the higher side. So not much difference in terms of which of the three would give you the more side effects. Okay, let's concentrate now on those that got Moderna as their original vaccination. And look and see what would happen if they got a booster with Moderna. You can see here that there is a side effect profile that you can see. There is more moderate symptoms here as you can see with Moderna. What would happen if they got the Johnson and Johnson as a booster? Here you can see also some moderate side effects, especially in the headache, myalgia and fatigue category. What about if Moderna patients got the Pfizer booster? And you can see here that there seems to be a little bit more mild reaction to those who get the Pfizer booster who had Moderna originally. Okay, let's finally look at those who got the Pfizer vaccine. In this case, those who got the Pfizer vaccine and get the Moderna boost, you can see that there is some side effects there in terms of moderate, myalgia, malaise, headache, etc. When I say side effects, I'm referring to the effects that we would expect to have happen if somebody got a vaccine, but would be considered a negative on the face of it, but something completely expected in this case. For those who have the Pfizer vaccine and get the Johnson and Johnson booster, you can see that there's also a little bit higher levels in this area of malaise and headache, but not much different. And finally, those going for their third shot of Pfizer, that would be the Pfizer booster for those that had Pfizer before, you can see here again a very similar type of profile. And while these symptoms after the vaccine boost were quite frequent, most if not all of them went away quite shortly after the boost. Now let's talk about efficacy. And here again, we're going to be looking at very similar types of situations. In this graph, we're looking at the IGG binding to S2PWA1, which is basically using spike protein as a surrogate for immunity. So in other words, what we're looking at here is how well do the antibodies or the IGG that's made after the booster, how well does it bind the spike protein that we see in SARS-CoV-2? And in this case, it's a surrogate of the actual viral spike protein. So the higher the numbers here, the better the immune reaction from the booster shot. And what we're looking at here is looking at the amount of IGG binding on day one. So that's basically the baseline. And you can actually get a lot of information just by looking at all of these different day ones on all of these different graphs. And so what we have here is those with the Johnson and Johnson here in the first column, getting a Moderna boost, those here, Johnson and Johnson getting a Johnson and Johnson boost, and in the first column, Johnson and Johnson getting a Pfizer boost. But before we go to that looking at the boost, let's just take a look at where things stand on the first day. You can see here that the antibodies from the Johnson and Johnson is considerably and consistently lower than the Moderna and or the Pfizer. And this goes along with what we've seen clinically in terms of prevention of hospitalization. So I do believe that this surrogate marker is actually predictive of clinical outcomes. So the higher this goes, potentially the better protection one would get from getting a booster. Also remember too, that this scale here on the y-axis is logarithmic. So the higher up you go, the bigger the differences are. Now again, I want you to remember that this is the full dose for Moderna, not the half dose that you might pick up when you went to go get your actual booster shot. Let's talk about what happens. So those who get the J&J shot, what happens when they get a Moderna booster? You can see that there's quite a rise in those antibodies. What happens when J&J gets a J&J booster? Not much of a rise in comparison to the full dose Moderna. What happens when a Johnson and Johnson gets a Pfizer booster? You can see there that there is quite a bit of a jump. So I would say for a J&J person, they should either get the Moderna or the Pfizer booster. What about those that have Moderna to begin with? You can see here that out of all three, typically the Moderna recipients have the highest binding antibody levels. So the question is, is what happens when they get a booster of the three different types? A Moderna being boosted by a Moderna does go up even still. A Moderna going up with a Johnson and Johnson does actually go up. And if you compare the 29 day in both cases, it's actually not too different. A Moderna, however, being boosted with a Pfizer seems to go up even higher than either one. And the reason, again, why we don't have day 29 data on the Pfizer boost there on the far right is because this is a preliminary data release and that data has not yet come in. So one can make the judgment here that when you compare this to this one, even still a Moderna vaccinated with a Moderna gives you the highest antibody levels anywhere on this chart. And so it could still be reasonably argued that even though you've had Moderna before and you're going to get a booster, it might be best to get Moderna for a third shot. But again, we're still missing this data. We don't know where this is going to go afterwards. Let's talk about those that have had the Pfizer vaccine. So those that have the Pfizer vaccine and get the Moderna do go up significantly here. Those that get the Pfizer and boost with Johnson and Johnson don't seem to go up as much. And those that have the Pfizer and boost with the Pfizer do seem to go up as much as those with the boost for Moderna. Remember, we don't have some of this data. And also this is full dose that we're testing here. And what's actually available for a booster is the half dose. Another way of looking at this is looking at the neutralizing antibody titers in the same situations that we looked at before. And as you can see here, the results were nearly identical to looking at the IGG binding to the spike protein seriode. So of note, if we're interested in looking at the efficacy of a booster on top of a fully vaccinated person, then the question is, what does a randomized placebo controlled trial show? And the results of such a randomized placebo controlled trial was published as a press release on October 21st from Pfizer. This has not been peer reviewed or published as yet, but Pfizer's record in terms of releasing data in press releases has been pretty good. And the numbers have turned out to be pretty accurate. So because of that, we shared these numbers here. So what they basically did is they took fully vaccinated patients with two shots of the Pfizer vaccine. And there was about 10,000 subjects in this study, which was randomized one to one with a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine and placebo. And the participants in this study were 16 years and older. And remember now that's a little bit different than what the FDA recently allowed for boosters. But again, this is the trials, the phase three trials for the booster. And in terms of the ages, you probably want to know how many of these were in what age category? What they have told us is that the median age was 53 years of age and that 23 percent of the people in this cohort were above the age of 65 years. Again, they've told us that there were 10,000 in this study. So we're assuming that there were about 5,000 in each arm since it was a one to one study. And they began looking for symptoms seven days after the shot. They finally reached the end point in the study with five cases in the intervention group, the people that got the third shot of the Pfizer vaccine, the booster. And there were 109 cases of symptomatic COVID in the placebo group. So again, we're looking for symptomatic COVID-19. And because of those cases, they're saying that there was a 95.6 percent efficacy of the vaccine to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 in patients who have already had two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Now, I'm going to make some assumptions here that if there were 5,000 in both groups, and the mean follow up time was about 2.5 months, which is important to understand. That means if they had five cases in 5,000, that would mean that there was a 0.001 chance of having symptomatic COVID in the intervention group and about 0.0218 chances of having COVID with just two shots of the Pfizer vaccine. So you can see these are pretty low. Here you have a 1 in 1000 chance as the absolute risk. And over here you have about a 2 percent absolute risk. So the real key that we need to know in terms of the value of an intervention is what is the absolute risk reduction. The absolute risk reduction is simply 1 minus the other. And in that case, the absolute risk reduction is 0.0208. Now you'll know from statistics that if you want to prevent one person from having symptomatic COVID-19, how many people need to get the booster to prevent one of those people from getting symptomatic COVID-19? That's known as the number needed to treat, or in this case the number needed to vaccinate, and that's simply the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction. And in this case that's about 48. And to give you an idea of what this means, to prevent death in somebody with a stroke TIA or myocardial infarction, giving an aspirin to them daily, given to 67 people in fact, will prevent one death. And that's a little bit less effective than what we're seeing here in terms of the number of people that need to get one immunization to prevent one of these people from getting symptomatic COVID-19 is 48. That's actually not too bad. But remember of course that it actually could be even better than 48 because the follow-up time here was only 2.5 months. And I think most people agree that the vaccine shots, while we don't know how long they last, probably last longer than 2.5 months. It'll be interesting to see once this paper gets published and peer reviewed what the final conclusions are. But I thought I'd bring this up in terms of the data out there and what it is looking like. Some might be wondering whether or not this has a higher effect in those that are older versus younger. Pfizer did say in this statement that multiple subgroup analysis of the efficacy were performed and there was no difference of other core morbidities. We also mentioned that the adverse events were consistent with all of the patterns that had been done before with the initial vaccination schedule. As always, there'll be more data to come and analyze. Thanks for joining us."
Multiple Myeloma: How Co-Morbidities Can Impact Vaccine Efficacy for COVID 19 (Update 136),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-10-26,-Z9Uht3p5o8,"I got as as you may have heard former Secretary of State Colin Powell recently passed away from complications of COVID-19 even though he was vaccinated. We're going to talk a little bit about the backstory. As it turns out, Colin Powell was not just fighting any cancer, but as you can see here, it was confirmed by his longtime chief of staff Peggy Cepremio that Colin Powell had multiple myeloma. And this is a cancer of plasma cells that suppress the body's immune response. Let's talk a little bit more about multiple myeloma and why it is such an immunosuppressant condition. This is a collection of plasma cells, a lot of plasma cells. Now this is the type of cell that's responsible for making antibodies. As we know from immunology, when you have an antigen, it binds to a very specific B cell receptor which is attached to B cells. Because B cells then under the chemokines of helper T cells will start to multiply and differentiate into plasma cells is what you see here. It's those plasma cells that finally release antibodies. The problem in multiple myeloma is that there is a particular clone of these plasma cells that start to reproduce out of control. And they use a lot of energy up to reproduce massive amounts of plasma cells that secrete just one type of antibody. And so you can see when you have so much energy going towards the reproduction of a specific plasma cell making specific antibodies, you can see why it's going to be difficult for a vaccine to give you the response that you need which is to create a different type of antibody from the one that you're already making. In patients with multiple myeloma, this is what would look like if we took their proteins and separated them out on a gel. What we would normally see and what is normal in individuals is this albumin spike, even the alpha one, alpha two and beta spikes. But what is not normally seen is this huge gamma spike. This is what is seen in multiple myeloma because there is one particular type of antibody or gamma globulin that is being produced. And because of that, again, there is a relative scarcity of regular antibodies. These are the antibodies that your body normally has circling around to help in infections. So it shouldn't come a surprise to anyone that patients with multiple myeloma typically get infections. And that's because, again, lots of energy is being directed to the cellular division of these plasma cells which are not helping out. We offer our condolences to the family and friends of Colin Powell."
Mixing Vaccine Boosters For COVID 19 (Update 135),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-10-21,HSyAssfva8U,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. We're going to talk about the FDA recommendations to the CDC on booster vaccines for COVID-19 and mixing and matching. And of course, we'll put a link in the description below to this news release. So at the time of this writing, these are the FDA recommendations, which will then go to the CDC and then have to be signed off by the CDC director. So the three vaccines are Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and finally the Johnson & Johnson. And as you may recall, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is given as a first dose, followed by three weeks, and then there is a second dose. The Moderna is given as a first dose, and then it's about four weeks, and then the second dose is given. And then finally, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is given once. So what the FDA is saying currently is for those people that had the Pfizer-BioNTech, they can get a booster six months after their second dose, and they have to be either 65 years of age plus or 18 to 64 years of age and at high risk. So they have a comorbidity, or they are frequently exposed. So that would be like a healthcare provider, somebody working in an environment where they're exposed often to COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 positivity. In terms of Moderna, they have exactly the same criteria. So six months, and you have to be either 65 years of age plus or 18 to 64 and high risk, or frequent exposure, like a healthcare worker, etc. For those that took the Johnson & Johnson, you only need to wait two months after your single shot of the Johnson & Johnson. And there all you need to be is just 18 years plus. There is no qualification of 65 years of age or high risk or anything else. In other words, they're looking at you to get a second dose or a booster after the first Johnson & Johnson. Now in terms of what it is that you can actually get, you can get as a booster any one of the three vaccines. So you can get the Pfizer for a booster if you had the Pfizer, you can get the Pfizer vaccine if you got Moderna, or you can get the Pfizer vaccine if you got the J&J. Also you could get what is known as the Half-Dose Moderna, which is the booster shot. If you got the Pfizer, the Moderna, or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. And also you can get the Johnson & Johnson as a booster if you got Pfizer before, the Johnson & Johnson booster if you got Moderna before, and of course you can get the Johnson & Johnson if you got the Johnson & Johnson before. So just to quickly clarify here, this is the FDA recommendations that are going to the CDC and could be signed off by the CDC director in the next few days. This is a news press release on October 20th. And again, Pfizer by on tech, six months after the second dose, if you are either 65 years of age plus or 18 to 64 and a high risk group or frequently exposed, you can either get the Pfizer by on tech vaccine, a half Moderna dose or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. If you had the Moderna and it's been six months since your last dose and you're 65 years of age or older, you can go ahead and get it. Or if you're 18 to 64 and high risk or have frequent exposure, you can get the Pfizer by on tech, the half-dose Moderna, or the Johnson & Johnson booster. If you had Johnson & Johnson and it's been more than two months, you just have to be 18 years of age or older and you can get the Pfizer, the half-dose Moderna, or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as your booster. And so in terms of analysis here, notice that there are age limits or there's age cutoffs here for the boosters for these vaccines that already had a second shot. There isn't one really for the Johnson & Johnson. So what they're saying to those that receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is go out and get any one of the authorized or approved vaccines if it's been more than two months and you're more than 18 years of age. So I hope this clarifies for you whether or not you qualify to get a booster. And I hope you share this with as many people as possible so they are also clear as well.

Vaccine Efficacy Versus Delta Variant: Real World Data (COVID 19 Update 133),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-09-23,rA-sCLJO2P4,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. Today we're going to talk about vaccine efficacy. I think that's an important topic given the current situation at hand where we're talking about vaccine efficacy and whether or not it's waning. There's some data out of Israel that seems to indicate that this might be the case. They've already approved booster shots in Israel for those over the age of 60. In this country, as you recall, a number of people were vaccinated over the age of 75 at the beginning of this year in January and February. It's been about eight months since that time. The question is, are we seeing a waning of vaccine efficacy in the United States to what degree is it going? Exactly how efficacious are the different vaccines that are approved, the Pfizer-BioNTech, the Moderna, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine? How efficacious are they against specifically the Delta variant? We've seen a lot of efficacy studies prior to Delta. The real question at this point, since Delta seems to be just about everywhere in the United States, is how effective is it against Delta? So let's take a look at this study. This was published in the CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and it's titled Interim Estimates of COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness against COVID-19 Associated Emergency Department or Urgent Care Clinic Encounters and Hospitalizations among adults during SARS-CoV-2-B1-617.2, and that's the Delta variant, predominance in nine different states from June to August of 2021. Now, again, no small study. There was 32,000 medical encounters, 187 different hospitals, 221 different emergency rooms and urgent cares, and this was done in a representative of nine states, Indiana and New York, California, Colorado, Utah, Minnesota, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Washington. It started in each of these areas when the Delta variant was 50 percent or more in the cohorts that they tested for. And they looked at vaccine efficacy and used the model to adjust for age, geographic region, calendar time, virus circulation, results within the surrounding counties, at the facility, on the date of the event, and was waited for inverse propensity to be vaccinated or unvaccinated. They're looking at the vaccination status in the community, the number of people coming into the hospital or urgent care or emergency room that are vaccinated and then they're actually testing for it. And the way they defined their cohorts in terms of vaccinated or unvaccinated was to be vaccinated, you had to have the Johnson and Johnson shot at least 14 days before the medical encounter or if it was the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccine, the second shot had to be at least 14 days before the encounter. And that's for good reason. It's because that's when we start to see the highest levels of vaccination and that's not a change in the definition. Of course, the unvaccinated were those that had no doses whatsoever. If there were people in between that, let's say they had their second dose within the 14 days or if it was the Johnson and Johnson, a shot within 14 days, they were excluded from the study. So we don't have that gray zone there of whether or not they were developing immunity or not developing immunity. It's just taken out of the equation so we can have a clean study. So let's take a look at this graphic. And the first thing that we're going to look at here is COVID-19 hospitalizations. Again, what they're doing is they're looking at discharge summaries which are COVID-19 like in terms of their hospitalization. So they came in with some respiratory issue. Perhaps there was a pneumonia on the chest x-ray, etc. They broke it down into the unvaccinated as the reference and the fully vaccinated as the intervention group here. And so you can see here that in the population, you would imagine if there's a lot of people that are vaccinated, that you're going to have fairly similar amounts in terms of who's coming in vaccinated versus unvaccinated and how are they coming in in terms of respiratory ailments. And then they checked their SARS-CoV-2 and the percent based on what are in this row. So in other words, of the unvaccinated group that came in with a COVID-related illness or COVID-like illness that they could look for, 1,316 of them or 18.9 percent were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Whereas in the fully vaccinated group, 235 or 3.1 percent tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. And if you do the calculation, you'll see that in terms of preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations, the vaccines as an all group was about 86 percent effective at prevention. That's a relatively high number compared to what we have been seeing outside of the United States and something that has stood up fairly well since the beginning of the year. Now if we look at emergency room and urgent care encounters, unvaccinated visits, 10,000 to the urgent care or the emergency room, fully vaccinated, 7,000. Now of these, how many had positive SARS-CoV-2 tests? For the unvaccinated, 28.9 percent did, for the vaccinated, only 7 percent did. And again, if we look at the efficacy in this, there was about an 82 percent efficacy rate in terms of prevention of these ED and urgent care visits. Let's take a look at hospitalizations once again, but let's break it down. And maybe get a little bit of information as to why this is happening. So if we look at the 18 to 74, basically those less than 75. So here is less than 75 and here is greater than 75. And we break it down that way. Once again, we're going to be looking at less than 75, unvaccinated, 5,700, 4,500 for the fully vaccinated, 1,252 for the unvaccinated and 3,125. But if we look at the percent positive for SARS-CoV-2 in those groups, in the less than 75, 21 percent were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 2.9 percent were positive under the age of 75 for SARS-CoV-2, giving an 89 percent efficacy rate. That's the highest that we've seen so far in this cohort. However, when we look at those that were older than 75 or equal to 75 years of age, now notice here, this is a population that generally speaking is highly vaccinated. So we have had very good success in vaccinating many of those people in nursing homes and over the age of 75 and have gotten lots of vaccinations. And you can see here that in terms of people coming in and being hospitalized with a COVID-19 like illness, so in other words pneumonia, things that can still happen even though you might not be getting COVID, you can see that there was a lot of admissions here in the fully vaccinated group. But when you actually tested them for SARS-CoV-2, what you start to see is that even though they're fairly similar in terms of this, so you might see this in some cases, and it was mentioned even in Israel where they'll look in the intensive care unit and they'll say, there's equal number of people who are vaccinated and unvaccinated. But if you look at the number of people that have actually been admitted to the hospital for similar illnesses that you would expect to see, and because there's more people that are vaccinated in this population, you'd expect to see more of those people, you'll see that there is still a difference between this. So 10.5 percent of the people admitted for COVID-like illness was positive for SARS-CoV-2, and therefore positive for SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19, whereas only 3.2 percent in the vaccinated group was, again, giving us an efficacy rate of 76 percent, albeit lower than the 89 percent, but still in a reasonable area where we would say this would have met the criteria for emergency use authorization, even today with the Delta variant. And again, this is 7-8 months out now at this point. Most of these people who are age 75 have received their vaccine about 8 months ago, and even despite the fact that they're over the age of 75, that it's been 7 or 8 months since they've received the vaccine, and they're going up against the Delta variant. We're still seeing an efficacy of 76 percent preventing the worst outcome for COVID-19, which is hospitalization. But now this is where it gets interesting, because now we're going to actually break it down, and we're going to, first of all, look at the emergency room and urgent care encounters, and we're going to break it down into the Pfizer, the Moderna, and the Johnson and Johnson, or in this case the Janssen, as it's known as, vaccine, which is the one shot. Now in all these cases, the unvaccinated control group is going to be the same, and all of those categories, because we're going up against the same in terms of that, and the number of people that have been testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. And if we look at the Pfizer-Biontech efficacy for prevention of an emergency room, urgent care visit, we see it is at 77 percent, the Moderna is at 92 percent, and the Johnson and Johnson, or Janssen Pharmaceutical product is at 65 percent. And this is against Delta variant. So those are your statistics there in terms of efficacy for the vaccines in the Delta variant, the most recent evidence that we have at this time here in the United States. We'll do the same thing now for hospitalization, and that's really the key here is preventing hospitalizations, especially when we're talking about situations in some states of the union where the hospital resources have run out. This is a current situation that's going on in Idaho, but it's not limited to Idaho. There are other states that are getting to that point. They're running out of intensive care beds. And so it's important that we have a tool in our toolbox to prevent hospitalizations, especially when this is going on. Let's go over the Pfizer-Biontech, Moderna, and Janssen vaccines. And we see here that the Pfizer-Biontech is 80 percent effective at preventing hospitalization, and the Moderna is 95 percent effective at preventing hospitalization. And the Janssen and Janssen is 60 percent effective at preventing hospitalization. If you'd like to read the article yourself, we'll put the link in the description below. We recently had a chance to team up with Dr. Rhonda Patrick of Found My Fitness, where we went over very important and popular questions about the vaccine in COVID-19. So I encourage you to check that out. Thanks for joining us."
"COVID Vaccine Myths, Questions, and Rumors with Rhonda Patrick and Roger Seheult",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-09-17,pp-nPZETLTo,"Welcome to this deep dive discussion about COVID-19 vaccines. I'm Kyle Allred, and I'm excited to be here with Dr. Ronda Patrick, who is a PhD in Biomedical Science, is published in a variety of reputable journals, and is the founder of the popular website and YouTube channel, Found My Fitness, and Dr. Roger Schwell, who is a quadruple board certified physician, as teaching appointments at University of California Riverside, and Lomolinda University School of Medicine, and is the co-founder of MedCram. And on both our channels, we've been gathering the most popular questions and beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines. Safety questions, efficacy questions, potential risk versus benefit questions. And I'm really looking forward to both of your responses, because since the beginning of the pandemic, you've been outstanding communicators about the science and the data as it becomes available. You critically read COVID studies, you confer with expert colleagues, and then you help break down, what do people really need to know? And you've also really focused on ways that people can optimize their own health and immunity throughout your discussions. I think this is going to be a lengthy discussion and geared towards people that want to better understand the data and some of the important nuances related to these questions. So thank you both for being here today. Dr. Schwell, I'm going to send the first question your way. I've heard some people say that COVID vaccines aren't necessary for relatively young people who are in good shape and don't have medical problems. What are your thoughts on this? Well, Kyle, as you may know, I'm a critical care intensivist and I take care of patients in the hospital. I work in a one ICU hospital in a one hospital town. So anything bad that happens comes to me in the intensive care unit. I'm the one that is there when they put the endotracheal tube in. I put the chest tubes in the central lines and holding the patient's hands. And so for me in the last couple of weeks, this has become really personal for me because what I've seen in the last couple of weeks in our hospital is like anything, nothing else that I've seen even with the prior wave going back to February and January of this year. So what is it that I'm seeing? I'm seeing patients in their 30s, patients even in their 20s coming in with very few comorbidities, maybe just a little bit overweight. And they are ending up on the ventilator. I've seen fathers in their 60s coming in crying, asking me to do everything that we can for their sons who are in their 30s, newly married with small children. We didn't see that back in February. And so to get to the root of your question is, is what do people who are younger have to be concerned about? I think it's a very good question because all of the things that we have learned about COVID-19 in the past is now being rewritten by the Delta variant. So if you look at some of this data, this is data from Virginia. And you can see here on the left hand side of the screen in January is a graph that we're all very familiar with. This is basically the monthly hospitalization rate by age group. And what you can see there is on the right side of that first graph is it's a very high number for the elderly and it goes down very precipitously for the young. And that's because the young were not being hospitalized. But as we go across this screen, you can see here that when we end up in August, a very ominous sign is occurring. What we're seeing is that the younger population are being hospitalized at almost the same rate. Instead of a 20th or a 10th, it's maybe half of the rate of the elderly. And so why is that happening? Well, we know that there is a very high vaccination rate in the elderly and a relatively low vaccination rate in the young. Even look at that, you can barely see it, but the yellow boxes are describing what's happening to pediatric cases. Pediatric cases, of course, those less than 12 years of age who can't get vaccinated are skyrocketing. And so this is the concern that I have. We look at some of these other issues, for instance, this idea of the 99 percent survival rate. That's something that they say, hey, 99 percent survival. And I really don't need to be concerned about it. So if you look at this data and we compare it to something that we know very well like the flu virus, you'll see here that the hospitalization rate for the flu virus in young people is about 0.01 percent. If you look at the pre-delta COVID-19 data, it's about 0.2 percent. So it's almost 20 fold higher for COVID-19 in the young than it is for the flu. Now, if you think about the 1 percent number, there's only the 1 percent that are going to be affected. That won't affect me. What we are seeing right now in this country, especially in states like Florida and Texas and specifically Idaho, is an overwhelming of the critical care hospital health care delivery system. Think about this. The population of the United States is 331 million people. If just 1 percent are going to die, that's 3.3 million people. And that's just the people who are dying. Let's talk about the people who are sick and need to be hospitalized because they can't breathe because of oxygenation. We only have under a million acute care beds in the United States. And so as a result of that, you are going to quickly overwhelm the health care system. Let's take the state of Idaho. It has a 39.7 percent fully vaccinated rate. And what we're seeing there, as of yesterday, the governor has declared that hospitals now because they're overwhelmed are going to start to deliver basically rationed care. You should not expect the same standards of care that you're used to expecting in the health care delivery system because they're just not able to give it. Let me give you some specific examples. Instead of having one intensive care nurse for two patients, it's now going to be one intensive care nurse for six patients with some help from non-ICU nurses. Because they're overwhelmed, you cannot transfer patients to higher level of care for things that they need to get done. If they have very advanced cancers, for instance, because those hospitals don't have room. If you need elective surgery, their elective surgeries are being canceled. Traumas are still happening. Babies are still being born. These are the problems that we're having in a situation where you may think that because you're healthy and strong and young, you're not going to be affected. But if you were to get into a car accident or you know somebody that wants to deliver a baby and has a complication, it's going to be difficult for those things to happen. And so this is the thing that's occurring. And going back to my experience in the last couple of weeks, every single one of those patients in the hospital that were there in their 30s, their 40s, were not vaccinated. And it's based on information that's coming out that you're making decisions based on whether or not you should get the vaccine because you hear about side effects. Or you hear about things, for instance, about myocarditis. Well, here's an article from the New England Journal of Medicine, peer-reviewed, published September 16, 2001, looking at the Israeli data with almost a million subjects in each arm. So what we have here plotted in yellow is the risk difference for 100,000 persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. And in blue is the risk difference for 100,000 persons who received the Pfizer-Biontac vaccine. First, let's take a look at SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. We see big risks here for acute kidney injury, for arrhythmia, for deep venous thrombosis, for pulmonary embolism, and for myocardial infarction. And again, notice that there is a small signal here in terms of COVID-19 for myocarditis and pericarditis. Clearly, there is a small signal there with post-vaccination myocarditis and pericarditis, but actually the data here on these from Israel is showing that it's more likely to get myocarditis and pericarditis post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. But in terms of the relative risks for the vaccine, which is in blue, notice that the biggest one here at 78 is lymphatinopathy, which is a normal response to the vaccine. Now, there's been a couple of papers that are in the peer review process, but have been published to a medical archive server. And again, the peer review process is where the paper is submitted to experts in the field that review it, looking for possible bias or things that were not taken into consideration. And this preprint non-perviewed article using electronic records in the United States also agreed with the Israeli data that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and came to the conclusion that young males infected with the virus are up to six times more likely to develop myocarditis as those who received the vaccine. Another preprint, which is still currently in the process of being peer reviewed, made headlines in a number of papers in the UK and also in the United States. And it showed the opposite that the incidence of post-vaccine myocarditis had a higher incidence than hospitalization in pediatric patients from COVID-19. However, the article gleaned most of its data from the VA ERS, which, as you know, is a reporting system and raw data based on reports that could be made by anyone and often contain incomplete descriptions and chart notes that require additional investigation removal of confounding variables and comparison to background levels of medical problems to become useful. Now, we'll talk about the VA ERS here just a bit, but as you'll see, VA ERS data doesn't allow you to really conclude anything. VA ERS can be used to generate hypotheses, but not to test them directly. So in summary, I think it's good for researchers to generate hypotheses from VA ERS data, but it's a problem in newspapers turn hypotheses of observational data that haven't been peer reviewed yet and turn them into headlines. So it'll be interesting to see what issues the peer review process points out in these papers and if they go on to be published. So to answer your question, Collette, there's a lot of information there, but for a young person now today facing the Delta variant and maybe future variants, it's not the same type of virus that we were dealing with back earlier in 2021. Yes, now they are more susceptible to getting the infection and now the risk of them being hospitalized is higher. Dr. Patrick, what are your thoughts on this question? Well, I think in addition to hospitalization, there's also the risk of people who have mild symptoms who don't have to go to the hospital. They stay at home during the duration of their illness are coming down with post-ic COVID syndrome, which is popularly known as the Longhall COVID. Symptoms range from brain fog to racing heart problems to lethargy and there's been a variety of studies that have come out that have looked at what Longhall COVID is and what population it seems to be affecting and interestingly, you'd think while people having these long-term effects would be the ones that were on the ventilator, well, of course people on ventilator do have long-term effects, but you'd think people with our hospitalized would be the ones mostly having these long-haul COVID effects and it turns out younger people, people under the age of 50, teenagers, even people in their 20s are the ones that are really coming down with this Longhall COVID syndrome. There was a pre-print that has not been peer-reviewed yet and it's a big study that was done out of the UK and it's part of this ongoing study called the BioBank Study. They get large population sample sizes. In this case, it was close to 800 people. It was 780 or something like that people before the pandemic came in and had MRI brain scans. There's researchers have all this data on individuals, brain structure and volume. Once the pandemic hit, many people came down with COVID-19, some mild cases, some more severe, some were hospitalized, and a few months into the pandemic, researchers doing this BioBank Study thought, hey, we should bring these people back in and get a brain scan and see if there's any changes. That's what they did, just months after their first scan, they brought them back in for another scan. What the preliminary findings, again, that are not peer-reviewed yet, showed is that there are major differences in gray matter regions of the brain. Gray matter, atrophy is occurring in several different regions of the brain, very prominently in the olfactory region, which makes sense because one of the telltale symptoms of COVID-19, at least pre-delta, was loss of smell, loss of taste. Also, there's atrophy in other brain regions involved in memory and learning. People that had severe COVID do have worse atrophy compared to the people that only had mild cases did not need to be hospitalized, but they themselves were also experiencing brain atrophy. These are people that did not have to grow the hospital. Of course, people were matched for the same age, the same gender, the same ethnicity, and the same time in between scans, so trying to keep everything as comparable as possible to compare apples to apples. To me, that was quite frightening because it really suggests that there are complications and there are long-term effects of this virus that we don't quite understand and that are affecting hundreds of thousands of people, I personally know quite a few. Dr. Schwell, anything to add on the long COVID front? Because I know that's a concern. That's a concern that I have at my age. If I got COVID-19, what I have lingering symptoms, what are you seeing on your end clinically regarding that? In addition to me working in the intensive care unit, I also have an outpatient pulmonary clinic. I've diagnosed at least three or four just off the top of my head blood clots in patients who went to the hospital, had COVID-19, survived, got better, so they weren't part of the 1 percent, but then they had persistent shortness of breath, leg swelling. We immediately made the diagnosis and put them on blood thinners. That's just a small slice of what we're seeing in terms of comorbidities. To add on to the blood clots and strokes, there was a study, multiple studies, one out of Israel and a couple out of the United States, showing that people under the age of 50 were coming in to the emergency room for strokes. One of the studies out of Israel found because they test everyone for COVID-19, a great deal of the high percent of the people that were coming in for these strokes, these young people under 50, had COVID-19 and didn't even know they had had it. We're talking obviously mild cases, potentially even asymptomatic if they didn't even know they had COVID-19 and they're coming in with strokes. Yeah, absolutely. And so this is the thing, is that COVID-19 has many different ways of affecting the body. The one that we all know about is the lungs, of course, because it can cause inflammation in the lungs, but as Dr. Patrick points out, there are blood clot issues, so blood clots to the lungs can also occur, but also blood clots to the brain, which manifests the strokes. Dr. Schwell, could you also speak to this question that some people have, or really the interpretation of something that's on the CDC website about death certificates, and how at one point only 5 percent of death certificates had only COVID-19 on the certificate. I know you fill out quite a few death certificates in the ICU. What are your thoughts on this idea? What can we really interpret from that? Yeah, so it really boils down to how the death certificate is filled out. Generally speaking, the way the death certificate should be filled out when somebody dies is you have the most proximal thing occur at the top line, and that would be, let's say there was a car accident, okay? You were in a motor vehicle accident, and as a result of the motor vehicle accident, there was a rupture of one of the internal blood vessels, and then you blood out. So you wouldn't just put at the top of that death certificate motor vehicle accident. That's not what the Bureau statistics of your state wants to see. They want to see ruptured pulmonary artery, and then under that they want to have the reason for the ruptured pulmonary artery. That would be motor vehicle accident. So when you are describing something with COVID-19, COVID-19, you don't die from COVID-19, right? COVID-19 is not a final cause of death. It is, it is, it may be the thing that set things in motion, and so you would have COVID-19 caused pneumonia, and then that caused something like a acute respiratory distress syndrome, and that was the cause of death. Because, as we've just mentioned, COVID-19 can cause death in many different ways. COVID-19 could cause you to die by a pulmonary embolism, or a stroke in the brain. Unfortunately, some physicians are just putting COVID-19 at the top. So I think how what you're referring to is this statement that we see here on the CDC website, and they say here that quote, the number of deaths that mention one or more of the conditions indicated is shown for all deaths involving COVID-19 and by age groups. For over 5 percent of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. So people have taken that to mean that really, COVID-19 only caused 5 percent of the 600 plus 100,000 people that have died in this country, and there, and all the other things were just comorbidities. But if you actually look at the CDC's website, you'll see what some of these quote, comorbidities are. And as we've just discussed, the actual way that COVID-19 kills people. So, for instance, the number one comorbidity was pneumonia. Influenza and pneumonia are grouped together. Well, the pneumonia was caused by COVID-19. It wasn't a comorbidity. Another one that's very common is respiratory failure. Yeah, it's not like people are coming with respiratory failure, and they also happen to have COVID-19. No, COVID-19 causes respiratory failure. And another one of these ones that was on there was adult respiratory distress syndrome. That's actually what they mean to say, there's acute respiratory distress syndrome. Again, another thing that's caused by COVID-19. And so what's happening here is that these physicians are very busy. They're being handed death certificates. They need to fill these things out. They think, oh, yeah, that guy, he died of COVID-19. That's right. And they just write COVID-19 at the top. That's the incorrect way of filling those out. And that's the reason why, fortunately, only 5 percent of those death certificates are being incorrectly filled out with just COVID-19. Just to clarify, using that data to make a case that really COVID-19 is only killing people with multiple comorbidities is not accurate. Not at all. Well, Dr. Patrick, this next question is for you, and it's about spike protein. And we know that the spike protein can be dangerous and cause a significant immune response. And there's this idea floating around that because spike protein is dangerous from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, therefore the COVID-19 vaccines must be as dangerous as well. What are your thoughts on that? Well, I have a lot of thoughts on that, Kyle. I've thought long and hard about it, but sort of before I get into some of the details, I think the spike protein has really become a common household name at this point. Most people around the world know what the spike protein is, mostly because it's the entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to get into ourselves. There are about 26 different spike proteins, I shouldn't say different, there are about 26 spike proteins that line the surface of a SARS-CoV-2 viral particle. And the spike proteins will bind to a receptor on many different cell types we have in our body that have a receptor called ACE-2. And when the spike protein then binds to the ACE-2 receptor, it undergoes a conformational change that essentially refers to the structure of it changes. So it binds onto this receptor and it then elongates and sort of twists and turns around. And then it fuses with the cell membrane and is engulfed inside of the cell. Another way it happens is through endocytosis, but essentially the point I want to make here is that conformational change happens because when the spike protein initially binds to the ACE-2 receptor, it's in a confirmation called the pre-fusion confirmation. You can think of it more like a closed type of confirmation. Once it binds, this triggers a conformational change for it to, again, like I said, elongate and sort of twist around. When it does that, that is referred to as the post-fusion confirmation. And the reason that's really important is because all of the vaccines that are available in the United States under either emergency use authorization or under FDA authorization or up-and-coming vaccine, so that includes the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, the Johnson & Johnson, Adenil viral vaccine, as well as the Novavax vaccine. They all contain an insertion of two proline amino acids into the spike protein to lock it into the pre-fusion confirmation. And this was brilliant work done by the structural biologist Dr. Jason McClellan. He's at the University of Texas in Austin. And he thankfully had figured out this way to lock viral proteins into the pre-fusion confirmation. First, it was with the respiratory sensation virus RSV. And then later he had figured out for the other coronavirus, beta coronavirus, the MERS coronavirus. And so he really had a running start there. And the reason that is so important is because when you're comparing the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as I mentioned, there's 26 of them on every viral particle, to the spike protein that is in the vaccines, including the mRNA vaccines and the vaccines in the United States, it's a different spike protein. It's a spike protein that cannot undergo that structural change. It does not elongate and dig into the cell membrane and fuse with it. It's a different spike protein because of those two proline amino acids that were inserted to lock it into the pre-fusion confirmation. And one of the first things you learn as a scientist, as a budding young scientist, is that you can't compare apples to oranges. You can't compare two different things. You have to compare apples to apples or oranges to oranges. And so when you're talking about a different spike protein, it's a different and structurally, it's different, right? You can't take a study that's looking at the spike protein that is from the surface of SARS-CoV-2 and say everything that that spike protein is doing applies to the spike protein in the vaccines that are available in the United States because it's different. And so I think that's a really, really upfront, important thing to understand. And the burden of proof is on people making the claim that the spike protein from the mRNA vaccines is dangerous because some studies have shown that the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 by itself can be dangerous. You have to show that and it hasn't stopped and shown. So what these studies that have shown that the spike protein from the from SARS-CoV-2 virus, how it can be dangerous, there's been some in vitro studies, which means cells in culture in the dish. When you dump spike protein on them, it can cause the activation of cell signaling pathways that could lead to cell death, which is often referred to as cytotoxicity. It's also there's also been some animal studies shown where either a recombinant protein, which is just basically made in a lab, so they make the spike protein or what's called pseudovirus expressing the spike protein. So this is not the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but it sort of acts like a virus to allow it to get into cells. If you directly inject the pseudovirus with the spike protein into the trachea of hamsters, it causes severe lung damage and also gets into the circulation and causes circulatory damage and vascular damage to the vascular system. So these studies, and there's been a few of those, have really spurred this idea that the spike protein from the vaccines must be dangerous because these studies showing the spike protein that's found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is. And again, you can't compare, you can't make that comparison. And that's really just one aspect of this story. The other aspect has to do with where the spike protein goes in the body. And I think first and foremost, anyone that's concerned about these studies showing that the spike protein by itself is dangerous should be terrified about getting SARS-CoV-2 because for one, you're getting, as I mentioned, 26 of those spike proteins on one viral particle. I want how many viral particles are replicating inside of your cells at any given moment. I mean, thousands, thousands of them. And on top of that, there have been studies that have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus is detected in multiple organs. You know, this isn't just in the nose and in the trachea and in the lungs, which in and of itself is bad. I mean, the damage to your lungs is, you know, one major concern. But the SARS-CoV-2 virus, again, with spike protein has been detected in the heart and humans. It's been detected in the brain. It's been detected in cerebral spinal fluid. It's been detected in kidneys. It's been detected in the GI tract. It's been detected in the testes. It's in many different issues in humans. So, oh, and it's been detected in plasma in the circulatory system. So again, you know, the concern should be amplified for actually contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus if you are concerned about the study showing spike protein itself is dangerous. And that sort of leads me into the vaccines. And generally speaking, I'm going to talk a little bit more about mRNA vaccines because there's been some more concern about that and there's been some more data on that. But people are concerned that these mRNA vaccines are getting into multiple organs and therefore the spike proteins getting into these other organs and causing damage. Again, different spike protein. So that needs to be considered. But a lot of this data stems from a lot of this concern, stems from a some data that was generated by Pfizer and Biontech when they were doing a bunch of safety studies looking at, you know, what happens when you inject really high concentrations of the mRNA vaccine of the mRNA vaccine by Pfizer into rodents. And so I think the first thing to keep in mind and I know that at MedCram, you guys have had people on like Dr. Shane Crottie who's explained how the mRNA vaccines work, how you have, you know, the mRNA inside of a lipid nanoparticle along with some other factors like polyethylene glycol. And that is injected into the deltoid muscle tissue. And that basically after that injection into the tissue happens, you have the lipid nanoparticle with the mRNA vaccine now getting inside of muscle cells using your own cell machinery, the ribosome to actually make the spike protein, which itself has been shown to peak after 24 hours. And then after 48 hours, the spike protein half-life of the protein that's made it's degraded, does not very long lasting. The mRNA itself also has a half-life somewhere between, you know, 48 to 72 hours. And the lipid nanoparticle has a very short, like within hours, it really only lasts long enough to protect the mRNA from being degraded. But once you actually do make the spike protein, the spike protein itself is, it is expressed on the cell surface and what's called the plasma membrane of the cell. And the spike protein itself has a region on it called a transmembrane domain that sticks it, it's like an anchor, anchors into that plasma membrane. So it is not freely floating out into your circulation. It is stuck there. And at that point, you have other immune cells that recognize this foreign protein and begin the process of, you know, making antibodies, you have that whole, you know, immunity effect. But the concern was from this from this Pfizer study where rats were given a dose that is 10 times the amount of what if humans are given, so humans are given 30 micrograms of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for one dose. The rat was given 50 micrograms of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. So if you were to do the calculation for a rat equivalent dose, so if you want to give the rat what humans actually get, equivalent dose based on their body mass, it would be more like 4.86 micrograms. So they got 50, that's essentially 10 times, okay. And this was done for a reason of, okay, what happens when we give them a huge amount of the vaccine? Well, what was found, the lipid nanoparticle that contains the mRNA was radio labeled, that's like a tag that you can visualize things, and that radio labeled tag was found in other organs. It was, you know, found in a variety of organs. Again, it was to a very small degree, but it was found in other organs. And so people got really concerned that these mRNA vaccines were traveling to other organs and causing damage. And a few things to keep in mind, they're one, the dose was super high. And in fact, within the same document, the same Pfizer study, they gave a more equivalent dose to mice, in this case, they gave mice to micrograms of the mRNA vaccine. And that vaccine did not go to all these other organs. In fact, the only organ that was shown to have any amount of the mRNA, of this radio labeled tag was the liver, and it was completely gone after 48 hours. And so I think that's really good news because it suggests, yeah, when you give, a rat 10 times the amount of what the humans are getting, you might have some spillover. But on top of that, again, the radio labeled tag that we're looking at is the lipid nanoparticle. And if there is some spillover, you know, in the muscle tissue, what surrounds the muscle tissue is your lymphatic system, lymph, where all the immune cells are. So you essentially have your immune cells, like dendritic cells, recognizing something foreign. In this case, a lipid, a radio labeled lipid nanoparticle with some mRNA in it. And they basically chop it up. And you know, it undergoes phagocytosis and is taken to other tissues for recycling. And so whatever we're seeing in those other organs, we don't even actually know if that's, you know, the intact mRNA vaccine lipid nanoparticles, probably just remnants of it because that's what your body does. So I think all of those factors in combination give some reassurance that people should not be so concerned about despite protein from mRNA vaccines or from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, getting to other organs and causing, you know, wreaking havoc essentially. And I will just add one more thing to that. And that is another study. And this is something that I've seen concern about on the internet. This study was done in humans. It was a very, very small sample size. It was 13 people and they were given the Moderna vaccine and what was found in that study is that 11 out of 13 people, the S1 sub-utin of the spike protein was detected in their plasma. Three out of the 13 had the entire spike protein detectable. However, the assay that was used to detect this S1 sub-utin and the spike protein itself in these 13 people has a false positivity rate of 25 percent. That's one in four people showing they have spike protein. So the way this study, this was another study done and it was, they took samples pre-pandemic. There should be no people with spike protein, pre-pandemic. And they were showing that they had spike protein. So with the sample size of 13 and a false positivity rate of 25 percent, you can't make any conclusion from that small study showing that 11 out of 13 people had S1 sub-unit of spike protein showing up in the plasma. It just doesn't make any sense to make any strong conclusions from that. So I guess the bottom line is that as Roger mentioned, we've had over 177 million people fully vaccinated in the United States. If this thing was causing severe damage in people, we would know about it. And we do know about the adverse effects that are occurring, like the myocarditis that is happening in some young people. It's still quite rare, but it also does occur. And again, as Roger mentioned, it's happening six volt higher in younger healthy individuals than it is in people in the same individuals that are being supposed to the to the COVID-19 vaccines. Well, that is a perfect segue to a discussion about adverse events and deaths reported from the COVID-19 vaccine. And Dr. Schwell, could you explain what theirs or the vaccine adverse event reporting system that we use in the United States is and how that data should be interpreted? Yeah, thanks, Kyle. So to back up a little bit, let's talk about a six-month period of time here. So if we look at December, January, and February of just a few months ago, that was a period of time, at least where I'm working in Southern California, where there was a lot of COVID. In fact, we had to build an entire new ICU with isolation precautions. We had to have nurses train. We basically used a lot of resources because surgeries weren't happening at the time. And compare that with the next three months after that, which would be March, April, and May. So the reason why those two groups of three months are very different is the first group of three months had a lot of COVID-19 patients coming in. We were very full. And then after that wave went away, we basically disbanded the second intensive care, you know, we were able to contract back to what we were doing before. And this despite the fact that in March, April, and May of 2021, we were vaccinating millions of people a day. And so again, I just want to underline what Dr. Patrick was saying there. If this spike protein from the vaccine was so dangerous, how were we able to contract down our hospital ICU intensive care services during that period of time? However, what did happen during that time was that there was a huge spike of, so the argument may be made, for instance, that maybe the spike protein is not causing disease or conditions that would get people into the intensive care unit, but it might be causing more mild symptoms or more mild problems. And that might show up in something called the VAERS systems. Let's talk about the VAERS. So as you can see here on the screen, there's this chart that has made the rounds on the internet. And what it does is it shows the total reported deaths post-vaccine. And you can see obviously not post-COVID vaccine because the COVID vaccine didn't exist back during these years. And we're going back way back. And then all of a sudden, there's this huge spike here. And these again are reported deaths. So this is evidence, some say, that these patients that are receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are dying. So again, I don't know how they could be dying without going through the intensive care unit. I guess it's possible they could be dying at home and never making it to the hospital. So let's investigate exactly what it is that's going on here. The thing that you've got to understand about this reporting system, a couple of things. Number one, you have to understand that because the vaccines that were given emergency use authorization in 2020, late 2020, because of this, they expanded the reporting requirements for the VAERS. In other words, before a physician would make a report to the VAERS if he suspected that a vaccination led to a death and they were under suspicion that something was connected. Now that was completely eliminated. Now, no matter what happens, if a patient gets a vaccine and anything happens, hospitalization, death, anything, it should be reported under law. So I wanted to take a look at this a little bit more in. And what I did was I looked at this paper that was published back in 2016. And it was looking at the flu vaccine because a lot of people say that this has never happened before. This huge increase in reporting from the vaccine has never happened. But yet there is a situation that occurred. And it was published here in December of 2016 titled Surveillance of Adverse Events after seasonal influenza vaccination in pregnant women and their infants in the vaccine adverse event reporting system July 2010 to May 2016. So as you may recall, in 2009, we had a flu epidemic called the swine flu epidemic. And in that year, there was a huge amount of H1N1 influenza. You can see that here on the screen with that red bar. So you can see the blue is sort of the endemic influenza. And then in 2009, this massive increase in H1N1 reports. And so what you also see here is that purple line is the amount of vaccinations that happened. So because there was a lot of influenza that was going around a lot of people were being vaccinated. So what you're actually seeing here, these bar graphs is the number of reports of adverse events. Okay, so that's key to understand that. Even though the vaccine had not changed, the makeup of the vaccine had not changed, what we saw was because there was more vaccinations being given, there were more reports being given. But there's something actually more to it than that even still. And that is that there was more understanding and more awareness of influenza. So what I've done here is I've superimposed Google trends. So how often somebody would get on the internet and search for influenza. You can see clearly there at the same point in time that we're seeing increased reported spikes. We're seeing an increased interest in influenza in general. In fact, the highest that there ever was during that time because it was a very important news item at that time. Now again, this was under strict reporting system. So they only could report whether they felt that there was a connection. But even that after they looked at it and published this patient, this is the conclusion that they came to. Despite the increase in reporting events, they said that the peak in the number of pregnancy reports observed during 2009 to 2010 followed by a decrease in reporting suggests that the 2009 spike in pregnancy reports after 2009 H1N1 in activated vaccines may have been due to stimulated reporting. In other words, the vaccine hadn't changed, the side effects hadn't changed. And so their conclusion was is that as in 2000 and 2009, 2010, no new or unexpected patterns in maternal or fetal outcomes were observed during 2010 and 2016. So if we take the same kind of methodology that we've done, we looked at this huge spike here with COVID-19 and this is supposed to be evidence that people are dying from the COVID vaccine. We see a very interesting pattern because if we look at Google trends and we type in COVID vaccine, obviously there's a massive spike at the same time, the same kind of recipe that we would see with the influenza. And then also just to make sure that we understand here, this is the deputy director for the Centers for Disease Control and this is what he says. He says, quote, healthcare providers reporting requirements are much broader than for other vaccines. After someone receives the COVID-19 vaccine, their healthcare provider is required by law to report all serious adverse health events. That would include death. Even if the provider does not think the vaccine caused that event, these events can include death in patient hospitalization or a serious case of COVID-19 that reporting protocol is due to the fact that the FDA authorized the COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. So you can see that the rules have changed in the middle of the game and so we have to look at that. So again, if we were to give a placebo injection, the question is, we would still see deaths associated with the vaccine. Why? Because we're vaccinating so many people and because of just chance. So I did a little bit of a epidemiological exercise. So bear with me. If you look at the US death rate per 100,000 population per year, it's around 870 deaths. So in other words, if you were to take at random 100,000 people in the United States and follow them for a year, you would find at the end of that year that about 870 people would have died. Obviously, as the age goes up, that can go up to as high as 4,000. Here in the 75 to 84-year-old age group, that's much higher. So let's just take the average. We'll be conservative. And also, if you were to look over the period of the last seven months going from January of this year to August, seven or eight months, you'll see that there's a fairly linear increase in the amount of vaccinations over that seven-month period of time. And in fact, over that seven-month period of time, there's been about 166 million people that have been vaccinated. So if that's over a seven-month period of time, the average period of time that someone's been vaccinated is about three and a half months. And over that period of time, which started in January, that's when we have the highest death rates. But then as we go through the year, it comes down to the lowest death rate. So that's over over that period of time. There's an average death rate in the United States. So let's do a little bit of calculating. If there is 870 dead people per 100,000 people per year, and we adjust that for the 166 million people that we've vaccinated in one campaign, and then we adjust that for instead of 12 months, just three and a half months, which is the average period of time that people have been on average vaccinated, we come to this number of about 421,000 people that should be dead just by chance from getting the vaccine. And clearly, that's not the number of people that we're seeing. The reports show maybe 10 or 15,000. So clearly, there is a huge amount of underreporting occurring. Now, realize that, again, most of the people who are being vaccinated, at least in the country, are actually much older. So this number should actually be higher. And number two, that most of the people that were vaccinated very early on, and therefore have a longer range of vaccination, were the older group as well. And so when you look at that, you can see here that the reported deaths totaling about 5 or 6,000 is a huge underreporting of the number of deaths that we should have if we just put a little red dot on their shoulder or gave them a placebo injection. And that's very important to understand because some people, some disingenuous people will show this and say, look, the vaccine is causing these deaths. And that cannot be gotten from that type of data. The other graph that you might see is this graph, which shows the number of days after vaccination that deaths are reported. So based on our 400,000 number that we've come up with, if we were to prorate that on a daily basis, we would come up with about 4,000 people dying on a daily basis, on average. Obviously, that gets bigger as more and more people get vaccinated. But what we're seeing here after a vaccination is only six to 700 deaths per day. Again, huge underreporting here at this point. So because there's huge unreporting occurring, one might think that what would be the most likely reporting situation, someone who got a vaccine and died the next day, or someone who died maybe a month later. Obviously, when you have a death occurring close to an event that has to be reported, the reporting is going to happen more likely in that situation. And you're going to have underreporting occurring much more likely a month later. And that's exactly what is demonstrated here with this graph. We see that the most reporting occurs within one or two days. And then it goes down precipitously consistent with that type of pattern. The other last thing I'll leave you with here is that with the mRNA vaccines, with Moderna, for instance, it's a four-week interval between shots. And for Pfizer, it's a three-week interval. If in fact that second shot is causing the problems that we see with myocarditis, myocardial infarction that's been proposed or been suggested, I would expect to see another peak here about three to four weeks out. But in fact, we don't see any such peak. And so that, again, lends me to believe that this graph is the result of reporting events and human psychology rather than an actual spike protein that's causing deaths in these patients. I agree that we should look for this stuff. This stuff needs to be taken seriously. And that is exactly the purpose of the VAERS system is to look to see if there are patterns. But to go out and say that the simply because there are deaths, that that must mean that the vaccine is causing deaths, I think that is disingenuous and not supported by the data. Dr. Patrick, anything to add to that? Yes, I do agree 100 percent with that last statement that Dr. Schwalt just said because people are taking this data that are, you know, accessible to the public from the VAERS system and they're trying to make sense of that data. But scientists from the CDC and from the FDA analyzed that data. They have to look at the, they have to, you know, stratify it by age, by gender, by ethnicity and see how many people die of X, Y or Z in that age range of that gender of that ethnic group without a vaccine. Just what's the normal background death rate? And you need to sort of, you need to do that comparison. Otherwise, this is like the worst epidemiology data you could ever imagine without any correction for compounding factors. You know, it would be like one year there was like, you know, there was 200,000 births in the city of San Bernardino. And at the same time, we had, you know, 10,000 storks that flew by. Therefore, storks have to be causing, delivering the babies. I mean, you know, are causing the births, basically. So, you know, epidemiology is a big mess. And so you can't just take that data and make these correlations. And I think to sort of add to what Dr. Schwelts kind of brilliant epidemiology experiment that he just explained to add to that in the United States alone, every 30 seconds someone dies of cardiovascular disease every 30 seconds. Now, generally speaking, most of those people are going to be 50 or older because cardiovascular disease doesn't usually affect people in their 20s or 30s. It can, but generally speaking, it's usually, it's an age-related disease more or less. And so, you know, if you look at the VAERS reported VAERS deaths, more than half of them are in a population of people that are 50 and older. So it's like, well, what are the chances that some of those people are probably just dying from a heart attack or from cardiovascular disease? Stroke every 40 seconds someone has a stroke in the United States. They die from it every about four minutes or so. So, you know, there's like, like Roger, Dr. Schwelts said, there are a lot of people dying every day in the United States, completely independent of COVID-19, completely independent of vaccines. So it's really not, it's not accurate to try to interpret the VAERS data yourself without stratifying it and looking at all the other factors that I just mentioned. But even on top of that, last time I did a VAERS report actually was probably close to a month ago, maybe three weeks ago. And at that time, I was stratifying the data by age and looking at the reported deaths. Over 584,000 people of the age of 50 and over have died from COVID-19. And last time I looked at the VAERS, which is about a month ago or so, about 5,000 people over the age of 50 had reported, you know, VAER deaths. And so even if you were to take that 5,000 and triple it, you're still 40 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than you are from a vaccine if you're over the age of 50. People age 40 to 49, about 20,000 people have died from COVID-19, according to the CDC website. If you look at the VAERS, it's much lower than that, about 200 people. And if you again, triple that number, even after tripling it, you're 33 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than from a vaccine if you are age 40 to 49. And then bring that down, bring that age grip down even further, 18 to 39 year olds. About 10,000 people have died from COVID-19 in that age range. And if you look at the VAERS data somewhere around 200, let's triple it 600 people. You're still 17 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than from a COVID-19 vaccine if you are in the age range of 18 to 39. So again, at every age group, you're much, much more likely to die from COVID-19 than you are from a vaccine. And that's not even, we're just directly taking the VAERS reporting. And as they said, you can't do that. We didn't even know if those deaths are actually causally linked, right? It's correlation. So I think when you look at it like that, it makes a lot more sense that everyone's going to be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus at some point. Do you want to be vaccinated when you're exposed to it? I do, personally. Okay, let me summarize my understanding of this and correct me if any of this sounds wrong. In our country of over 300 million people, there is a background number, an expected number of deaths and other medical problems that are going to happen on a daily basis or an annual basis on average. And then we have this reporting system, the vaccine adverse event reporting system, where medical professionals are not only encouraged, but they're actually required to report any medical problem or death that happens after someone gets a COVID-19 vaccine. Whether or not they think the vaccine caused it or not. So it's an epidemiologist, another scientist job to look at the number of reports that come into the V A E R S and compare that with the background numbers for each age group and other demographics and assess, does the number of reports actually rise above what we would expect for that age group and other demographics? And in listening to you, Dr. Schwell, it sounds like for deaths reported from the COVID-19 vaccine, the number of deaths actually falls far below the background level that we would expect, which suggests that there's under-reporting, but it also suggests it's very unlikely that a significant number of deaths are happening from the COVID-19 vaccine. Do I have that right? Yep. Absolutely. And I think just to kind of even add to that, you know, the myocarditis link that we now know about linked to the mRNA vaccine specifically came out of the V A E R S data. And after the scientist, epidemiologist, analyze the data, they found myocarditis was above that background noise. It was higher. So there was something there. And you know, I've heard so many conspiracy theories that, you know, the government agencies don't want us to know about it. Don't want us to know about the adverse effects. Then I just don't understand why we would know about myocarditis being linked to the mRNA vaccines or why we would know about rare blood clots in some cases with Johnson and Johnson. Very, very rare. If there was some big conspiracy, why would we know about some of the potential rare adverse events, but not others? It's always powerful when someone knows someone who got a COVID-19 vaccine and then had a death afterwards or, you know, some new onset of symptoms. So what would you both say succinctly to someone who says, you know, my parent or a grandparent or whoever got the COVID-19 vaccine and then three weeks later, they died of a heart attack. I think that those are links. What would you say to that person? I'll start with you, Dr. Schwell on this one. Yeah, I mean, this is this is really what makes this human beings. We have to put on our scientific hats when we talk about numbers because we can't be attached to it. And on the other hand, we're also human beings and we live with it. So it's hard to do that. I can tell you that when I'm in the hospital, if I give a blood thinner to somebody because they have a condition and they bleed out and die and the next person that comes in with that same condition, I'll have to tell you as a human being, I'm a little bit less gung-ho about giving that person a blood thinner, even though it's indicated. And it has, and it's the right thing for that person. In other words, what happened before doesn't necessarily tell me what's going to happen again. It's statistics that tells us that. And that's actually one of the fallacies of medicine. So when you're making medical decisions, there's always going to be risks. It's always going to happen. I can tell you that. I mean, I don't let anybody tell you that we don't do harm in medicine. We try to do more benefit than harm. But we give aspirin to people who have heart attacks. We give blood thinners to people with atrophibulation. Are you telling me that we've never had a situation where someone is blood on a blood thinner or someone has gotten an ulcer from aspirin? It happens. But we have to look at the benefits versus the risks. So in that situation, I would tell them that it's possible that whatever they had could be linked to the vaccine, that we have to look at epidemiological studies to see whether that's the case. And I would understand if they were hesitant to get the vaccine in that situation. I would completely understand as a human being because that's the same struggles that I have as well. But if we want to make policies going forward, we always have to realize that no matter how many times you've rolled the dice and it's come up six every time. But the next time you roll the dice, there's still a one in six chance that it's going to be a six despite the previous rolls. So and unfortunately, that's what we have to deal with when we're looking at risk-the-benefit ratio. Maybe one day in the future we'll be able to do a better job at predicting who will benefit and who won't. But right now, we do the best that we can. Dr. Patrick? I think just to add, sorry. Go ahead. Just to add to that, I think, you know, the fact that matters that in the United States alone over six 177 million people are fully vaccinated, over a billion people worldwide. And, you know, as Dr. Schwault point out, people respond to things differently, to drugs, to different the foods that we eat every day. You know, if we were to give peanuts to 177 million people in the United States, a large, a good size of people would have a pretty serious adverse reaction. Same goes for shellfish, you know, it's a really big world out there. And there are individual differences in the way we respond to foods, to medications, to vaccines. But it doesn't mean so, you know, in other words, it's not as zero risk as Dr. Schwault was saying. But it's also not the 100 percent of the population is not responding that way. It's not because there's something inherently for the most part. You can't have a medication that is dangerous. But, you know, we would know that by now with 177 million people fully vaccinated in the United States, and over a billion people worldwide. We would know. Yeah, and Kyle, this is all probably a good time to also say that, you know, the purpose for Dr. Patrick and myself being on here is really to educate people on what are the risks and the benefits and the relative risks so that they can make an decision. And the reason why we want to arm them with that information is so that they can make a decision. So we're not forcing people to get vaccines. This is the, we're not the purpose of saying it's okay to be forced to get these vaccines. We're not really for mandates. We're really here to educate. And I think that's an important distinction, but Dr. Patrick can speak for herself. Yeah, I'm 100 percent agree. I would never want to force anyone to do anything they're scared of. I certainly wouldn't want to force a parent to do something to their child that they were scared of. And I think that the purpose of this podcast and in general, speaking about what the data shows about vaccines in COVID-19 is to really help people that don't have the capacity to interpret the scientific literature to help them have a more in well informed, you know, basically background so that they can make a good decision on whether or not they want to get or choose to get vaccinated. And I think that there are people out there that are not giving good information for whatever reason. To be honest, there's a lot to gain from making sensationalistic claims that something you think is good for you is actually not. So we think vaccines are good for us, but they're not. And you can gain a large following and there can be a little bit of a perverse incentive in some instances for people that are technically versed in the scientific literature that may have a degree, higher education, and yet are cherry picking and misleading people that does happen. And in order to counter that, I think it's important to put an unbiased approach, try to interpret the data for what it is, and also put that information out there. Right, Dr. Patrick, us next questions for you and it's about antibody dependent enhancement. Can you explain what that is? And if you think it's relevant or applies to COVID-19? Sure. So antibody dependent enhancement refers to when your immune system makes antibodies against a pathogen that is, it's non-functional. So the antibodies can bind to the pathogen, for example, in our interest here, a virus. They can bind to it, but they don't neutralize the virus. And in fact, not only do they not neutralize it, they can activate other immune cells to become more aggressive and cause more damage. So in the end, the immune system can end up being more damaging after being exposed to a virus than if it hadn't previously had those antibodies. And so when I say previously had these antibodies, most often I'm referring to a vaccine-induced antibodies. And I would say that in the United States, we really became aware of this phenomenon back in the 1960s. So this was when the respiratory, sensexual virus vaccine, one of the vaccines was made and it was being clinically tested in infants and toddlers. They were given, so half of the infants and toddlers in the treatment group were given the vaccine and the other half were given the placebo. And then the infants were then going to be exposed to the RSV virus, which as all of us parents know like every child gets. And it's a respiratory virus. They end up having a cough that can oftentimes linger for quite a while. So what was terribly tragic about this vaccine story is that the infants and toddlers that had received the RSV vaccine about 80 percent of them were hospitalized after being exposed to the RSV virus naturally versus the infants and toddlers that had placebo only 5 percent of those infants and toddlers actually ended up in the hospital after being exposed to the RSV vaccine. And so this was terrifying and of course the vaccine never made it past this original clinical trial. But what was happening is antibody-dependent enhancement wasn't quite known at the time, but much research has, decades have researched since then have been done. And it's now known that antibody-dependent enhancement occurred. So the antibodies that were generated from the RSV vaccine were binding to the virus. They were not neutralizing it. And in fact they were making the immune system worse. They're making the immune system act worse in response to the virus and become more damaging. And so what was figured out by many scientists including some of the work of Dr. Jason McClellan who I mentioned earlier is that the antibodies that are generated that play a major role in antibody-dependent enhancement are called post-fusion antibodies. And you probably can guess it. We talked about how viral proteins go from a, they make a structural confirmation change. They go from a pre-fusion confirmation to a post-fusion confirmation. Well guess what your immune system is making antibodies to both of those different types of viral proteins. And so what the brilliant work of Jason McClellan showed is that you could basically lock a viral protein into the pre-fusion complex. And when you then use that pre-fusion viral protein in a vaccine, you don't make post-fusion antibodies because you're not, your body isn't exposed to that structure of the viral protein. And so that's what we have in all of our U.S. vaccines, the pre-fusion viral protein, the pre-fusion spike protein. We are not making post-fusion antibodies against the spike protein, which is so reassuring that antibody dependent enhancement is so, it's so unlikely to happen because we don't make those antibodies. And of course on top of that, what we would see in the hospitals, as I mentioned with RSPs, is that if you take an unvaccinated versus a vaccinated person and randomly choose them at any point, then the vaccinated person would always have the most severe disease. They would be the one that are most likely to be hospitalized compared to unvaccinated. They would be most likely to die. And I'm not talking about, you know, if you have all of your population vaccinated, well of course you're going to end up having some people in the hospital that have been vaccinated. I'm talking about comparing the unvaccinated to vaccinated. What you would see is that unvaccinated people would be less likely to have a severe disease. And that is not what we've seen at any point during this pandemic at all. So that's also reassuring. I think a lot of concern for antibody dependent enhancement came out of both in vitro studies. Again, those are studies done in culture cells in like a petri dish, as well as in vivo studies. These refer to animal studies can be, you know, a rodent or a hamster, you know, you know, pick your, pick your animal. These studies were done with the original SARS virus back in 2003 or 2002. What we now call SARS-CoV-1, that when vaccines were made for that virus and injected into some animals, they did cause antibody dependent enhancement. That was not the case with all studies and all vaccines for the SARS-CoV-1. So it was sort of an inconsistent data. But that's really what started the initial concern. I myself was concerned. I was reading this data and I thought, oh, geez, well, that's scary. So at the time, I didn't know anything about the post-fusion antibodies that were involved in that. And how, you know, Dr. Jason McClellan and his collaborators had figured out a way to bypass that to lock that viral protein in the pre-fusion complex so we don't make those antibodies. So that is really at the end of the day, gives me a lot of peace of mind that antibody dependent enhancement is not likely to ever happen with our current vaccines in the United States. Dr. Schwell, anything to add to that? Yeah. So as Dr. Patrick was saying, if we look at Israel, which has been vaccinating with the Pfizer vaccine, the longest that of any of the countries on the planet, and we look here at the Delta variant, which is what we're interested in. We really need to make sure that we're concentrating on the Delta variant because that's the current variant here in the United States. There was a study that was released and you can see here on the graph, we've got read as those who are unvaccinated in Israel and green those who are fully vaccinated in Israel. And you can see here that over the months of July and August, which were just pure Delta at the time, it was the unvaccinated that we're having the most severe cases. And that would not be the case if we had antibody dependent enhancement with the Delta variant. That's clearly not the case. If you break it down in the next graph by age, you'll see that the same relationship occurs with age, but again, in each of these age categories, if you age stratify them, you will see that is the unvaccinated that are leading the severe cases. So this goes against the grain of what you may hear that Israel is telling us that the Pfizer vaccine is just breaking down. It's useless. It's not working. That's simply that's just totally not the case in terms of preventing severe cases, which is an important endpoint. Dr. Schwell, this next question is for you and it's about the vaccines and human fertility. There's an idea that's been floating around that the COVID-19 vaccines somehow impacts fertility. What are your thoughts on that? Yeah, so it's come from many places. One place in particular was this idea that the antibodies made against the vaccine would cross-react with proteins in the placenta. So let's go back and look at some of the data to see if actually this is happening or not. And you can see here, I've got a table of the phase three trials in the four different major vaccines that are available. We have Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen, which is the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. So in the phase three trials, one of the specific exclusions for entering into the trial was the fact that you might be pregnant. So those were excluded, but of course, accidents happen. And so what we have here is a number of subjects in the phase three trials that became pregnant after enrolling in the study. And so while these aren't huge numbers, they just sort of give us a little bit of an insight. What you can see here is we've got the control group on the left, the vaccinated group on the right. And in all of these cases, the amount in the vaccinated group and the control group were the same. So if you look, in the Pfizer vaccine, we had 12 pregnancies that occurred in the control group, 11 in the vaccinated group. We had seven pregnancies in the control group in Moderna and six. We had nine in AstraZeneca and 12, four in the Johnson and Johnson and four in the vaccinated group. So in terms of miscarriages, that was also looked at. And as you can see, there was no statistical significant difference between either pregnancies or miscarriages, at least in the phase three trials. Well, that's not where we have to leave it because we've looked at this now after, and there was a very good trial data that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine titled preliminary findings of messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant persons. And what they looked at was a number of areas. They looked at pregnancy loss, spontaneous abortions, stillbirth, neonatal outcomes, preterm birth, small size for gestational age, congenital abnormalities, and even neonatal death. And they compared the rates of people who have gotten the vaccine and were pregnant to the registry. So the V-safe pregnancy registry data and compared it to the published incidents of these occurrences. And what they found in every one of these cases is that there was no statistical significant difference in terms of what they saw in the pregnancy data versus what they should see in the regular population. Finally, what I would say, from my standpoint, is to direct you to Dr. Vicki Mail, who we've had here on made cram and has a Twitter account. She is a reproductive immunologist that has found it herd duty to always constantly being updated in terms of data, in terms of not just pregnancy, but also breastfeeding, in terms of getting pregnant, in terms of all of those risk factors. And I would highly recommend that you check her out on Twitter. But I'll be interested to hear what Dr. Patrick has to say. I'm just sort of adding on to the New England Journal of Medicine paper that you just referred to. There was a follow-up study. It's still a preprint to my knowledge. And this study was done in around 2,500 people. And they were women, specifically. They were given they were given a COVID-19 vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy. And much like you mentioned with the study in New England Journal of Medicine, the miscarriage rate was on the low within the normal range and it was actually on the low end. So it was about 12.8 percent of miscarriages that occurred and the normal range is between 12.5 percent to 18.7 percent. So again, it was on the low end of the normal range. There was another study that was published last June and it was in the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. And that study found that neither having previously had a SARS-CoV-2 to infection or having had a COVID-19 vaccine affected embryo implantation. So there was no effect on the ability of the embryo to implant into the uterus. On top of that, there was a very small study looking at fertility in men. And this study found that there was no effect of COVID-19 vaccines on any of the normal sperm parameters that are measured like motility, etc. Like there was no effect on that. So I think generally speaking, it seems as though all the data so far points to no effect of COVID-19 vaccines on no real, you know, large effect of COVID-19 vaccines on fertility. Okay, Dr. Patrick, this next question is for you. This is in your wheelhouse and it's about the mRNA vaccine specifically. And since this is for a lot of people, new technology, technology they haven't heard about. And there are rumors that this is somehow gene therapy and it's going to be impacting our own DNA within ourselves. Can you speak to that and what are your thoughts about those rumors? Well, sure. I think it's understandable for most people to be a little concerned because they've never heard of this mRNA technology. The word RNA is in it and you know, it's a little, it's just overwhelming in a sense. And I think as I mentioned earlier when I was talking about, you know, from a thousand foot high, mile high, you know, viewpoint how these mRNA vaccines work and how there's, you know, a sequence of the messenger RNA inside of a lipid nanoparticle and along with some other factors that essentially when that lipid nanoparticle with the mRNA gets inside of yourselves, your cells themselves are ribosomes translate that mRNA into actual protein. And so really, it's more accurate to be a protein making technology in a way. And but nonetheless, there's been a lot of fear that mRNA vaccines are gene therapy that are altering our DNA. And so to understand that, you need to understand, I mean, I think first and foremost, if someone says that to you, you might want to ask them, where inside the cell is DNA reside? And if they don't know the answer that question, then they probably don't understand what they're saying. So our DNA is resides in a part of our cell called the nucleus. It is protected by the, it's inside of a nucleus. And you can't, things don't just freely pass into the nucleus of the cell. In order to get inside of the nucleus of the cell, you have to have what's called a nuclear localization sequence. This is a very specific sequence that allows something to get inside of the nucleus. And so there's no nuclear localization sequence anywhere in this mRNA, anywhere, you know, inside of the lipid nanoparticle, it's just, it's not present, it's not there. So there's no, there's no way for it to get inside of the nucleus of the cell. If somehow it did somehow miraculously get inside of the nucleus of of of our cell, where our DNA resides, in order for it to alter our DNA, the mRNA would first have to become DNA. And in order for that to happen, you would need an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. There's no reverse transcriptase inside of our nucleus, inside of the, you know, lipid nanoparticle with our MNA. It's not present. So that is not likely to happen. But if all those things were to happen somehow, then in order for the DNA, so if you somehow got inside the nucleus, turn the mRNA into DNA, and then in order for it to alter our DNA, you'd have to have something called an integrate enzyme. I would have to integrate into our DNA to get in there to change it. And again, no integrase enzyme present there, it's not going to happen. So the chances of the mRNA vaccines actually changing our DNA are so small. I mean, it would just take some sort of grand conspiracy where, you know, we're getting somehow getting these enzymes into this mRNA, it's doing all this stuff. I mean, like, it's just not going to happen. It's not biologically plausible. Dr. Schwell, anything to add to that? Yeah, I mean, the central dogma of molecular biology is that DNA goes to RNA, RNA goes to protein. And what we're doing with the vaccine is we're simply instructing the ribosomes, which reside in the outer portion of the cell to make the protein. This, by the way, is exactly what the virus does. And so if you're a little bit freaked out or creeped out by the fact that your cell machinery is being taken over to make something that it shouldn't be making, well, let me introduce you to COVID-19 because that's exactly what's happening in the viral infection. And instead of it happening just in one or two cells, it's happening in millions of cells. In fact, there's billions to trillions of copies of the virus that's being made in one individual. And it goes all throughout the body. So what's happening here with the vaccine is that it's simply using the ribosomes to make proteins. There's no aspect of the messenger RNA vaccines that do anything with the nucleus. And it's the nucleus that holds the DNA. And that's where your genome is. When just to add to that, Dr. Schwell, you know, we, we, speaking of viruses and what viruses do, we know some viruses actually can change, change back into DNA and affect our DNA. So HIV is one, some of the herpes viruses as well. So, so if anything, if there's anything to be worried about changing our DNA, it's, it's actually viruses themselves. Dr. Schwell, working in the ICU, I know you've been following any potential treatment for COVID-19 very closely throughout the pandemic. And you've featured a number of potentially promising treatments in your COVID-19 update videos. And I want to ask your thoughts on this idea that, you know, viable treatments currently exist or or viable options exist if one were to get COVID-19 or even potentially to prevent them from getting COVID-19. And therefore, they don't need the vaccine because they can just treat it effectively if they get it. What are your thoughts on that? Yeah, so that's a very interesting philosophy. I follow the philosophy of the Swiss cheese model. Let me explain what that is a little bit. Imagine you've got a block of Swiss cheese and you've sliced it up all throughout. And if you were to pull out one of those slices, you would see that there may be some Swiss cheese holes in there. And each slice would have the holes in different places. Maybe some slices would have more holes than other slices. But the bottom line is that the more slices of Swiss cheese you put in there, the less likely you're going to be able to find a hole that's going to get through all of those slices. And that's the general principle here that we see with the Swiss cheese model of making sure that we have the best protection we have to avoid the outcomes that we don't want to have. Let me put it in a different perspective. In the operating room, we want to make sure that we have no post-operative infections. And we have a lot of layers that we put into that. For instance, the surgeon wears a mask. The sterilize the instruments. They put a solution, a sterilizing solution over the area of the skin that they're going to make the incision. I mean, this goes on and on. Positive pressure ventilation in the room, a scrub nurse adjusting the humidity in the room, just right, adjusting the temperature in the room, just right. So we don't say that because sterilizing the equipment works, then therefore the mask doesn't work. Or say the fact that we have to put sterilization solution on the skin that therefore we don't have to humidify the room. I mean, that's foreign to medical thinking. I mean, if we even think about it in the general practice, right? We do crash tests on vehicles. Not because we don't think seatbelts work. We don't put airbags into vehicles because we don't think crash to, I mean, what we're doing is we're doing multiple layers because the more layers we have, the better protection we're going to have in the end to avoid the undesired outcome at the end. So to hear this about saying that people are getting vaccinated, but because we're making everyone wear masks, that must mean that the vaccines don't work. That's just completely, I'm lost on that. That's not the way we think in medicine. We try to avoid these things. And so the Swiss G's model is how we think about this. So one of the things that's come up is the idea of Ivermectin. Ivermectin is this medication that was initially studied. This came out in June of 2020. And what they found was that in high enough concentrations in vitro, in a test tube, when they went to something called five micromolar concentration, they were able to completely shut down and reduce by about 5,000 fold the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to reproduce. And so obviously there was a lot of excitement because perhaps we might be able to use a repurposed medication like Ivermectin, which has been around for years and is used as an anti-paracidic or anti-helmetic medication, especially in South American Africa. Perhaps this could be used to treat COVID-19. This paper, which was an in vitro paper, looking at five micromolar concentration that was required to shut down, was one of the things looked at. The problem was, is that when you look at the actual dosing of Ivermectin in a human being, you only get about 0.28 micromolar. So that's a number of orders of magnitude, if you will, reduced, then the concentration that you would need to have in the cell to get that. So this paper here that was published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology said that the free plasma concentration of Ivermectin was actually 250 times lower than the concentration required to reduce viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. But again, this is all in vitro, and so we look at actual randomized control data and meta-analysis. There was a meta-analysis that came out in June of 2021, titled Ivermectin for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection, a systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis to inform clinical guidelines. What they did was they looked at a number of different studies. Some of them were randomized, some of them were not, well randomized, some of them had bias, and they analyzed all of those things. They came up with the conclusion that there was moderate certainty of evidence that there was a reduction in death compared with no Ivermectin, but the rest of the conclusions had a very low certainty evidence. Now this meta-analysis included a randomized controlled trial that was later redacted, retracted, because there was basically fraud going on in the study, although that hasn't been fully investigated yet, but it seems as though there were some problems in that study. The authors of the meta-analysis say that it wouldn't have changed the overall conclusion, but you can kind of see that there are some questions. A lot of these studies were done in patients that were basically outside of the United States, and why would that be an issue? If you think about this, Ivermectin is a medication that kills off parasites. If you look at some of the data, for instance, in Egypt, in the Middle East, South America, the amount of clinically silent parasitic infections in the population approaches in some studies 50 to 60 percent. So you can imagine if you take these patients who then come down with COVID-19, put them in the hospital and apply to them large doses of Dexamethasone, which is an immunosuppressant. It's possible, we don't know for sure, but it's possible that some of these parasitic infections may be coming less silent and becoming activated with the suppression of the immune system. So it makes sense that in those types of situations that adding Ivermectin may be beneficial, not because it's helping out COVID-19 specifically, but because it's suppressing these concomitant infections that are going on. That is a potential possibility. So if you're asking about whether or not Ivermectin should be used in the United States, what you really need is randomized control trials in the United States, looking at the United States population. Right now, I'm happy to say that there are a number of studies that are undergoing not only in the United States, specifically at Temple University in Philadelphia, but also there's a trial that's looking at McMaster University and also in Brazil called the Together Trial. And what they've done is they've actually made this platform where they can rapidly assess the efficacy of repurposed medication. So things like hydroxychloroquine was looked at. That didn't find any improvement, so they stopped that study. They looked at lapinavere, rotonovere, and they stopped that study because there wasn't improvement. They stopped the Metformin study because there wasn't improvement. But there are two medications that they're currently looking at. They're looking at the Ivermectin single dose to see if that is causing any improvement. But the one that they're noticing actually has an even better signal that they're studying more is Fuvoxamine, which is an antidepressant medication. It has some claims that it may be an anti-inflammatory medication, antioxidant. And so the point is, is that we should be looking at these medications. It should be done in a randomized control trial under a specific study platform. And we shouldn't be writing these things off. So the question is, is whether or not we should be requiring the high level of evidence that we normally would have in a pandemic or not. And I think that's a reasonable question to have. But these things do need to be studied. They need to do need to be looked at. But realize at the end of the day, this is just one slice in the large slices of cheese. We can't all depend on that one slice because every slice has holes in it. And the more slices we have, the better. And so as part of my philosophy, if there is something that works great, that's a slice. But it doesn't mean that we don't do the other things that are important because nothing is 100 percent. Dr. Patrick, what are your thoughts on this question? Well, I do have many thoughts, particularly with the Ivermectin being as good as vaccines statement that is very sensationalized. And I think is doing a lot of harm because as Dr. Schwab pointed out, we should study any type of therapeutic that is repurposed. Anything we know is safe in humans and anything that could have even the slightest positive effect on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 illness because we need everything that we can to fight this. You know, we need multiple therapeutics. We need vaccines. We need everything. And so I think when sensationalize something more than the data suggests it deserves, then you have a couple of problems. One, you're misleading people and that's a big problem. And two, you're getting a sort of knee-jerk reaction from researchers, scientists, from physicians that are going, whoa, wait a minute, something feels a little, you know, off. I'm, you know, and so you kind of put off those people that otherwise may be more open to looking at that therapeutic. If they otherwise didn't hear a very sensationalist acclaim like Ivermectin is just as good as vaccines that protecting against COVID-19. And so meta-analysis Dr. Schwab mentioned a very, a very popular one that was a systematic review and did show some conclusions that were positive, generally speaking. But when you actually go down and look at the individual studies within that meta-analysis and other types of analysis that are aggregating a bunch of data, what you'll often find is a common set of problems. And these problems are manifold. One, they include the co-treatments and the treatments are very different with each of these studies. So for example, sometimes you'll have Ivermectin alone. Sometimes you'll have Ivermectin plus Zithromyrosin. Sometimes you'll have Ivermectin plus some kind of no spray. Sometimes you'll have Ivermectin plus Ivermectin plus Vitamin C and zinc and blood thinners and Zithromyrosin and the kitchen sink basically. Then you'll compare that to sometimes placebo, sometimes hydroxychloroquine, sometimes hydroxychloroquine, and Zithromyrosin, sometimes doxocycline. And so there's so many variables here that you can't look at just one of the variables and say Ivermectin is doing this. When you have Ivermectin plus the kitchen sink or you have Ivermectin plus something else compared to the kitchen sink or compared to, you know, so there's a lot of variables that are just being aggregated together. They're very different. The second major problem with a lot of these studies is that they are small sample sizes. And so at the end of the day, when you're looking at a clinical endpoint, for example, hospitalization, when you have 50 people in a group, you know, then if two people end up in the hospital, so you have two people in the control group end up in the hospital, but out of the other 50 people, you only have zero show end up in the hospital. So let's say in the Ivermectin group because you'll find studies like this, it's such a low sample size that the risk of that event happening, the certainty of that event happening being actually, you know, causal by that treatment is so low, like you can't make a definitive statement about that. And so what you'll see happening is that more and more studies we pull together so that you now have larger sample sizes when you pull them all together and then your certainty becomes a little bit better. But then you have to ask yourself, well, is that really true? You know, when you have such a low sample size within that individual study, pulling them together is kind of a statistical way of manipulating the data in a way, saying, well, look, there's statistical significance when you pull it all together. But, you know, I just, I think that's really important to keep in mind when you're looking at some of these meta-analysis with Ivermectin. And then you also have the clinical end points varying. So you have people looking at hospitalization, you'll have research groups looking at deaths, you'll have research groups looking at viral clearance, time to a negative PCR. And in some cases, they're all being aggregated together and it's like clinical benefit is the end point. And it's like, well, geez, these are vastly different clinical end points. So you really need to be careful when looking at aggregated data. And certainly there's a number of websites out there that are doing this. And I can tell you that I've looked at these individual studies. And in many cases, I mean, it's everything I just mentioned and worse. It's where you can't even find the numbers that they're coming up with. But, but sticking to just the scientific literature, you know, even that systematic meta-analysis that Dr. Schwell mentioned, you know, if you look at all the different studies and a lot of them were pre-prints that they included, the only real consistent finding that was found, consistent meaning every study showed it was time, was basically time to a negative PCR. In other words, Ivermectin and Ivermectin plus the kitchen sink or Ivermectin plus whatever, it seemed to lead to a faster viral clearance to some degree. And again, it might be that it takes Ivermectin plus the kitchen sink to do it, but that Ivermectin plays a small role. We don't really know. And when you take Ivermectin plus the kitchen sink, you can't pinpoint it and say it's Ivermectin doing it. You just can't do that. It's unless you give the kitchen sink without Ivermectin to the control group. And then you can say, well, look, they were given the exact other, you know, array of therapeutics. And they didn't have the same improvement as the other group with the array of therapeutic treatments plus the Ivermectin. So there's a lot of nuance to this. And I think that at the end of the day, there is a little bit of a signal. There is something that seems to be going on with Ivermectin, whether or not it's in combination with all these other things or by itself, it's unclear. And I think, you know, what is clear is that we definitely do need more data. We need more high quality data. We need more data from, you know, states that are from countries that don't have a really high background of parasitic disease. The doctor Schwell pointed out. It's a very big compounding factor. But also, we need to not sensationalize something and, and, you know, speak, speak about things that are not true. Like there's just no evidence that Ivermectin is going to protect you from infection and from severe disease as well as a vaccine. There's no evidence of that. And so don't make that claim. You know, make the claim for what the data speaks to. There may be an effect. There may be an effect, particularly on viral clearance. And so, you know, I think, I think if people would tone it down and not make these grandiose claims, there would be a lot more interest in Ivermectin and studying Ivermectin. And, you know, the other thing to keep in mind is that there's been a lot of people that have now sought out a veterinary form of it because it is something that in addition to being used in humans, proparesitic diseases and helmets and also scabies and lice and things like that. It's also used in, like, you know, people are calling it horse to warmer and which, you know, it's just, it's not a good idea to go and get a veterinary type of medication and try to treat yourself because there's vastly, you know, different doses involved. I mean, you know, horses are much larger than humans. And so, you know, it's just, it's very dangerous to do something like that. And I think people have sort of heard these sensational claims and sort of taking their own action and trying to get some form of Ivermectin and really that could be quite dangerous. So, I think I agree with Dr. Schwell that we should be studying these, you know, these repurposed therapeutics. And there is a potential for Ivermectin, at least in my opinion, at the very least. It seems as though it's pretty consistently involved in speeding up the viral clearance to some degree. It's not like a huge, huge effect, but there is an effect and it's consistent with pretty much all the studies that I've personally looked at. So, I think that, you know, we should really go after that and try to see if that's real. And that's pretty much my thought. Excellent. And speaking of those studies that you both talked about and these meta-analyses, one argument I've heard for Ivermectin is some of these population-based studies where certain countries have decided to give Ivermectin on a large scale. And you can understand, potentially, their motivation. They want to protect their population and prevent COVID-19 if they can and they're going to use whatever resources they think they have to do that. What are some problems with these population-based studies for people who aren't familiar with what those are? So, basically, they're known as ecological studies. They're great to look at. They're hypothesis generating, but you don't rely on hypothesis generating studies to determine whether or not somebody gets some medications. What you need to be able to reach the point where you're able to prescribe someone something is what the FDA requires, which is a randomized placebo-controlled trial that's usually multi-centered and it's very large. And that's what you have to do to be able to say, this is the medicine that's indicated for this condition. And we just haven't had that yet here in the United States. And just sort of add to that, Dr. Schwell, I mean, even going back to the original clinical trials with our mRNA vaccines. There were 75,000 people originally in that randomized controlled trial where half the population was getting the treatment, which were the vaccines and the other half was getting the placebo. And then on top of that, so that's a large number of people. And the sample sizes with this Ivermectin is a fraction of that. I mean, a fraction. And on top of that, we now have all this real world data where we've got billions of people worldwide who have had a COVID-19 vaccine. And they are protecting from severe disease and to some degree, they're also protecting against even getting infected, depending on which, you know, vaccine a person has gotten. So we know they're effective. We know from large, large, large numbers. And to sort of even add on to that, everything has changed since the Delta variant. We have had to sort of start again and look at aggregate new data because this is a new variant where our vaccines are not as effective at preventing infection. And you know, the reality is, all these meta-analysis and all this data we just talked about with Ivermectin, this was not when Delta was the dominant variant. We don't really know what Ivermectin even does with the Delta variant. Haven't seen data really showing how Ivermectin affects Delta variant. Yeah, that's a great point. And you know, found my fitness even more than Meg Kram, we've been talking about things that you can do, things that are easy for you to do, like sleep, we talked about vitamin D. So we're not opposed. I mean, look at our video histories, our respective video histories, where we are all in for trying to take control of your health care, take control of your life, and to do this. So let's just take the 3,000 foot level here, the 30,000 foot level. This vaccine is indicated for this particular virus. I mean, I'm not naive to believe that this is the only pandemic that we're ever going to see in our lifetime. It's not the only illness that we're ever going to have to deal with. Some of those other things that we talked about with vitamin D, with sleep, with exercise, stress reduction, fresh air sunlight, these things have enormous benefits, not just with COVID-19, but every other aspect of our life. And so, again, it's the Swiss cheese model, the more slices you have in there, the better. 100 percent. I mean, the low hanging fruiter is obviously the things that you can do to improve your lifestyle, making sure your vitamin D levels are high enough, trying to be metabolically healthy, eating the best diet or losing weight if you're overweight or obese, getting a good, good enough sleep. All these things are hugely important for overall health and certainly for immunity. So, again, thank you for pointing that out, because it really, at the end of the day, there are so many factors that do need to be optimized as well. Dr. Patrick, this question is for you, and it's about transmission. And we know that the Delta variant has been a game changer, and we've seen the efficacy of vaccines dropped to some degree with regards to, do they prevent symptomatic COVID-19? And we're also aware that transmission of the Delta variant may be happening among, well, is happening among fully vaccinated people. So, what are your thoughts on this? Should this shake people's confidence in getting a COVID-19 vaccine? Well, I think people have, it's always easy to make generalized statements when you see a little piece of data coming in, which, by the way, new data every day, things are changing constantly, hard to keep up with. But, you know, I think people have made this overarching statement that vaccines do not prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In other words, they do not prevent people from getting contracting COVID-19. And I think to understand why that is not true, we need to start with the word transmission, because there are two major types of transmission when we're talking about a viral illness here. First is called on-word transmission. And this is the type of transmission that is more at the individual level. So, a person becomes infected with a virus. They have viral particles in their nose. And, you know, they're basically shedding viral particles. And this can be transmitted through aerosols and large respiratory droplets to other individuals, right? So, this is the transmission of the virus that most people think about. But there's also what's called its overall transmission. And that is the transmission in an overall population, this is at the population level. So, if we have a treatment or a vaccine that is able to prevent even a small percentage of people from becoming ill, then it still reduces overall transmission because fewer people are actually getting the illness. And so, as you mentioned, the Delta variant has sort of changed everything because when, you know, we had the alpha variant and even the beta variant, we know that the vaccines in the United States were largely effective still. And, you know, in many cases, still 90, 95 percent effective at preventing people from even getting COVID-19 symptomatic and seeking out health care. We know that in addition, people that did become, that did get infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus, they were, they actually had fewer viral particles. They were not transmitting the virus like an unvaccinated person was. That's all changed with Delta. Now, we have to aggregate new data, see, see, you know, what the data shows. And I think I would say that are the data shows that in about July of 2021 is when the Delta variant in the United States really started to become dominant, sort of took over. And so, there was a large study that was done out of the Mayo Clinic. Many states were involved in terms of like the sample population from many different states in the United States. And this was like 25,000 people that were vaccinated versus 25,000 people that were unvaccinated. And what the Mayo Clinic study was looking at first was vaccine efficacy, like the ability to, you know, prevent people from getting COVID-19 and also looked at the efficacy of preventing hospitalization. So, that's also very important. And so, when the Delta variant became dominant, it was clear that efficacy for preventing infection went down. So, people that were fully vaccinated with a Pfizer vaccine went from an efficacy of like 88 to 93 percent or something like that down to 41 percent. So, there was still some efficacy. In other words, you know, 41 percent of people that were fully vaccinated were still not getting COVID-19, which means that the Pfizer vaccine still reducing overall transmission. And on a similar level, the Moderna mRNA vaccine also had reduced efficacy in terms of preventing infections, although it wasn't quite as dramatic. So, Moderna vaccine is about twice as protective as the Pfizer vaccine in getting a new and getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, there was about 77 percent effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, again, overall transmission is reduced because, you know, a large percent of people with a federally vaccinated with Moderna are still not getting even infected. So, that was good news. Hospitalizations were still quite, both vaccines were still quite effective anywhere from 80 to 97 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations, which is ultimately the most important thing as Dr. Schwell pointed out earlier in this discussion, you don't want your hospitals overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients because when your parents have a heart attack or if you get in a car accident or your child comes down with a severe form of RSV, you know, or feel in the blank, you're not going to get the care that you need and you deserve. And so, it's good to prevent hospitalizations because that protects our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, which is important for all of us. The other thing that was found was that, that, that I think with the not with the Mayo Clinic study, but there was another study, a large study that was done out of the UK. And this study showed that this was the most interesting thing in my opinion in this study. This also included AstraZeneca vaccine, PUSA AstraZeneca has largely been used in some European countries like in the UK, that people that were fully vaccinated were still, you know, there were still some efficacy in terms of protecting against, you know, getting the virus as I just mentioned with the Mayo Clinic study, something similar was found. But when you looked at peak viral load, in other words, when the virus is at peak for for replicating, the peak viral load was similar in a breakthrough infection from a vaccinated person versus an unvaccinated person that had contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And so that sort of caused a media frenzy to, you know, to sort of make this general statement that vaccines don't prevent transmission. And it's just not accurate to say that for one, they're still preventing overall transmission as we just discussed. But two, you need to look at overall viral replication. So, so, you know, it's not just peak transmission that's important. You're transmitting this virus to other people at many different stages of being infected. And so that's exactly what this pre-print study out of Singapore, which was with the Delta variant, showed that while initial viral loads were similar between a breakthrough vaccinated case and an unvaccinated person that had SARS-CoV-2 virus, in fact, effective with SARS-CoV-2 virus, those initial viral levels were the same. If you followed those individuals over time, the vaccinated people cleared the virus faster than the unvaccinated. So they actually had a shorter negative PCR time. And if this, if this was true, you would have the hypothesis that at any given time, if you were to take a random person out of the population and sample their viral load, then you would see vaccinated people at any point in time should have a smaller viral load because they're clearing the virus faster. And that's exactly what this real-time data that's being aggregated out of the UK, it's called react study. That study found that if you would take a random sampling of people at any point in time, vaccinated it, breakthrough cases, they had a lower viral load than unvaccinated. So I think with this data, it suggests that not only do the vaccine still prevent, sorry, still reduce overall transmission, they also still reduce onward transmission. So they are, they're still affecting transmission on multiple levels. And so I think that's really important to keep in mind. In addition to that, understanding who gets the breakthrough infection, why are 41 percent of people vaccinated with Pfizer still protected from even getting, you know, SARS-CoV-2 virus and why are 77 percent of people fully vaccinated with Moderna not getting infected? Well, there was a big study that came out of Israel looking at breakthrough infections. Now, this wasn't necessarily when Delta was dominant, but I think it still is important to keep in mind that, you know, what's causing these breakthrough infections? We don't know exactly everything, but if you look at this Israel study, they were looking at healthcare workers, and there was about 15,000 of them basically. And these healthcare workers, they took blood samples and they could look at their antibody levels against these were vaccinated healthcare workers. They could look at their IgG antibodies and I'm not sure what other antibodies they looked at, but they could look at the levels of them and quantitate them. And then if they came down with a breakthrough infection, they get sort of used that data and go, oh, could we predict whether or not this person came down with a breakthrough infection based on their antibody levels? And that's exactly what was found. People that had lower antibody titers were much more likely to get a breakthrough infection than people that had higher antibody titers. And there was another great study that came out, it was a Miles Davenport group and it was published in Nature Medicine. And he did this mathematical modeling to predict breakthrough infections. And what he found was that it seems as though, according to his model, people need a sixfold higher antibody tighter level to be protected from contracting SARS-CoV-2 virus. Then they need to be protected from being hospitalized from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In other words, you need a much lower antibody level or tighter to prevent yourself from being hospitalized, but you need a higher level to prevent yourself from actually contracting the virus itself. So what Dr. Patrick has told us is that there is a difference that you have to look a little bit deeper. I was able to find a preprint of a article that just came out a couple of weeks ago that looked at the quality of those viral particles that are shed from those that have breakthrough infections. So in other words, is it possible that the shedding of the virus that comes from unvaccinated are the same as vaccinated? And what this preprint showed, very interestingly, if you look at this graph, here we have the amount of viral load being shed on the x-axis. And on the y-axis, what they did was they tried to see what was the chances of these viral particles of actually growing in a viral culture, kind of a surrogate to successfully infecting the next person. And what you can see here is the dark blue are those that are unvaccinated, and the light blue are those that are vaccinated. You can clearly see here that at any given viral load, the vaccinated health care worker in this study from the Netherlands was shown to have a less likelihood of infecting somebody based on viral culture. So not only do we see with the vaccinated less breakthrough infections, and when there are breakthrough infections, they are cleared faster. But we're also seeing that the viral particles that come out of vaccinated people are less likely to infect. And that's important because there has been some talk going around that it's the vaccinated people that are transmitting the virus more and causing these outbreaks to those that are unvaccinated, and those are the ones that are showing up to the hospital. But clearly here, the data is showing that that is not the fact. Oh, just to add to that, Dr. Schwal, that is very interesting. That study is very interesting because the way that researchers are measuring peak viral load is through real-time PCR. And real-time PCR can actually be detecting dead viral particles. So there's a hype that makes a hypothesis, even quite likely that there are some dead viral particles, which you would even sort of theorize would be true because if you do have antibodies against the spike protein that your immune system would start to kill or to clear the virus that you're being exposed to since you have some antibodies, you'd think there would be some effect. So that's very interesting. Right. And it boils down to the thing that I've heard that explains this is PCR is a way of looking at dead body parts and assuming that those dead party parts are alive. All it's looking for is parts of the virus. And parts of viruses don't in fact, they just make PCR positive. Right. Exactly. You can have some, I mean, so the question is like how many of those viral particles are actually even alive. And if they were alive, you would imagine that when you put them in culture that they would replicate. And so very interesting study. Dr. Patrick, I've heard some people say that the vaccines themselves might be contributing to putting certain pressures on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Specifically, this idea that the vaccines can make the virus actually more deadly or more virulent. What are your thoughts on that? Well, I certainly like coming into hearing these statements, which I've heard it's proliferated on many different areas of the blogosphere and people that I, that I, you know, friends or friends, you know, et cetera. My first thought was, well, if this is, we need to know whether or not this is true because if it is, it changes everything in a way. Right. You don't want to make a vaccine, you don't want to make a virus, you know, more deadly to the unvaccinated. And that's kind of what the general statement is, is that the vaccines are causing selective pressure for the virus to mutate into a more virulent form, which is more dangerous and deadly to the unvaccinated. Nobody wants that. Like, like if that were the case, I mean, all of our children are unvaccinated. So, you know, as a parent to me, I wanted to get to the bottom of this and understand, is this something to be concerned about? Because if it is, it's a game changer in my mind. So, as a non-evolutionary biologist, I went on a, you know, a path to trying to understand is to the best of my knowledge, you know, the literature and what the literature out there says on, on how viruses evolve and what the selective pressure is and what, you know, what that typically, you know, entails. And so, from all of my reading and understanding, again, I'm not an evolutionary biologist. To me, I came out of it with the understanding that viruses, the selective pressure on viruses is to evolve to become more transmissible. They are not under a selection pressure to become more virulent. In other words, it's not in their best interest to kill their host. Because if they kill their host, then they can't, their host can't incubate the virus and allow them to reproduce and infect more people. And so, all the studies that I've read outline that there are these factors and that virulence isn't something that's selected for. It is something that happens incidentally to transmission. In other words, it sort of hitch hikes alongside. So, a virus evolves to become more transmissible. Like, that is its major purpose. And in some cases, if it becomes more transmissible, sometimes it can also become more virulent. It can be more, you know, dangerous to its host. And so, in other, so, many of the different studies have outlined that there are factors that limit transmission. So, if something limits the transmission, then it's also going to limit the potential of the virus to become more virulent. And the factors that limit transmission are one physical constraints. So, the virus infects human cells and the human cells then make viral proteins. And, you know, are basically allowing the virus to replicate. So, our own cellular machinery, the ability of our cells to assemble viral proteins, the ability of our cells, metabolically to do it quick enough. Like, there's a limit to that. Like, we can only do that so quickly. So, once that happens, then, you know, a virus is sort of reached its peak transmissibility in a way, because our cells physically can't do it quicker than it's already doing it, if that makes sense. And so, with the Delta variant right now, we may be at a peak transmissive, transmissive, you know, we may be at the point where our cells can't assemble all the viral proteins quick enough for it to become even more transmissible. We don't know. Maybe we're not there yet, but maybe we are. We have no idea. It's definitely a much more transmissible variant. So, that's the one thing that limits the ability of a virus to become more virulent is the limitation on transmission. The other thing is host mortality. And so, you know, if a virus, you know, is killing the host within a certain time frame, but, you know, before transmission ends, then, you know, you start to like not be able to transmit the virus more, and you're not going to have more variants crop up because the host is dying. And so, this is something people have been very concerned about with vaccines, because the argument is that vaccines are preventing more, you know, they're preventing hospitals, they're preventing people from dying from COVID-19, and therefore they're going to allow the virus to have a chance to mutate and into something that is more virulent. Again, it has to train, it has to mutate into something that's more transmissible, virulent, hitchhike, hitchhike along the side of that. But if you look at the deaths in COVID-19, people that are unvaccinated are just generally speaking, people usually die much later than the transmission phase. They die, you know, days and days and days after actually becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. And so, transmission phase is well over before people are even dying. So, the reality is, is that people that are unvaccinated have, you know, they're creating these mutations and allowing variants to evolve even at a greater rate, because not only are they, you know, able to do it even before they potentially succumb to death, but, you know, the fact that we just talked about overall transmission reduced by vaccine. So, people that are vaccinated are less likely to even get infected. And we talked about onward transmission reduced. In other words, people are clearing the virus faster that are vaccinated than unvaccinated. And every since, people that are unvaccinated, there's more chances for the virus to replicate and to potentially mutate and form another variant that could become more transmissible. And that's potentially more virulent. Now, people are also conflating the vaccine-escaped immunity. That is a completely different thing. That is not something that is relevant to virulence. If you look into the, if you look at the large body of scientific literature covering this topic, I shouldn't say large body. It's actually quite limited, but, you know, so, so there's no example of human vaccines causing a more virulent strain. There are examples of vaccine escape. So, in other words, variants crop up that are no longer, that can evade the antibodies produced by by vaccines. And that's that's a different thing. That isn't something that's more virulent. That's something that's going to affect people that are vaccinated because now they're going to be more likely to be infected and their vaccine is less effective. That's a very different thing than than what we're talking about, which is the evolution, the selective pressure on viruses to transmit, become more transmissible. And that is the selective pressure that exists, not virulence. Virulence hitchhikes alongside the transmiss, transmission, mission aspect of why viruses, you know, you take basically in the selective pressure that's on them to do that. Dr. Schwal, I want to hear your thoughts on that. And also, Dr. Patrick mentioned how, you know, with Delta variant and other variants. And in the past, with vaccines, how sometimes a variant can crop up that escapes vaccine antibodies. Can you talk a little about the other big aspect of the immune system? And that's the T cell response. And how that can still offer us a lot of protection potentially. Sure, yeah. So, first of all, in order for you to have variants, you have to have replication because it's the errors in replication that cause variants. And so, the only way you can have replication is if you have viruses in hosts. So, if you look at the examples that we have, whether it's alpha, beta, gamma, delta, most of these variants, if not all of them, came from populations that were not vaccinated. Now, India has done a great job at producing vaccines and they're well on their way to vaccinating their population, fortunately. But the Delta variant came out early on when they were not having a lot of people vaccinated. Same thing with the South African variant and the P1 that came out of Brazil. This was during a time where there was not vaccinated. If it was vaccination that caused variants, then we should be seeing variants coming out of Israel in the United States. Now, in terms of B cell, or I should say antibodies, antibodies are very important when it comes to neutralizing a virus that is outside of your cells predominantly. So, neutralizing it before they infect the cells, so that's very, very important. But there's a whole other aspect to the immunity that help in terms of hospitalization, in terms of those memory T cells. And that is what we just mentioned, it was the T cells, the cytotoxic T cells and the rest of it. What's interesting that I've found about T cells is that when they reproduce, they also reproduce in a way where they put errors in there so that as the virus may mutate, there seems to be some evidence that the T cell response may be able to anticipate and mutate along with it. Now, that's not 100 percent science yet, but there seems to be some evidence of that, at least in the research articles that I've read. And if you look at what's happening right now with the Delta variant in Israel and the United States, we see a reduction in the ability of the vaccines to reduce transmission, right? So, with the Delta variant, instead of the 90, 80 to 90 percent that we enjoyed early on in the pandemic, it's been knocked down somewhat. But we really haven't seen an erosion to that extent in prevention of hospitalization and severe disease. And that has more to do with T cell responses inside of toxic, because by this point, the virus is inside the body already inside the cells and antibodies have very limited abilities to take care of those types of situations. So, the immune system is very complex and I think we need to sort of look back and always couple our in vitro hypotheses with real world data. And so far, the real world data is still holding up in terms of prevention of severe disease. And I'd also like to add, there's been some sort of a false equivalence, if you will, that is made in terms of what we know that overuse of antibiotics can cause bacterial resistance to those antibiotics. And there's no question about that. That's a whole other topic of discussion, the overuse of antibiotics in humans and in animals, especially. And that gives rise to these super bugs that emerge that are no longer susceptible to the antibiotics that we have. But that's a different situation. That's where the antibiotics that are being used are basically selectively killing out all of the susceptible bacteria and only leaving those that are resistant. So, in other words, the resistant bacteria already exist, but we're knocking out the bacteria that are susceptible and allowing the resistant forms to produce. That's very different than what we're talking about with vaccines. Because in the terms of vaccines and viruses, the resistant viruses don't exist. What allows them to be created is the ability to replicate. And that's very different with bacteria. In bacteria, very few resistant bacteria are occurring because they're being allowed to replicate. The only way that they can become resistant is if they acquire DNA that gives them, they're called plasmids or vectors that allow antibiotic resistance to then be incorporated in their DNA. That's not the case with viruses. Viruses and bacteria are very different. Dr. Schwell, I think the most common reason I've heard for people choosing not to get the vaccine is that they feel like the process may have been rushed, that there isn't enough long-term data yet. They may be willing to get the vaccine at some point, but they will look at the historical timelines for vaccines and realize that it takes often 10 years, maybe the average for a vaccine to actually be manufactured and go through the authorization and approval process. So, what are your thoughts about this sentiment? Do you feel like the vaccine was rushed? Do you feel like we can trust the process in this case with this particular technology? That's a great question. So, there is no question in my mind in anyone else's that this process was accelerated. No question about it. The question is, is was the quality of the product compromised by the acceleration of the process? And here you can see on the screen a typical vaccine timeline. If this was done under normal situations, we would have started in 2020, and we wouldn't have had a product until 2034. And the reason for that is because there is risk in making these vaccines, but there's also processes that they have to go through. So, there is the research that has to happen. Then there is the pre-clinical trials, the bench top trials, and then phase one to figure out the right dose, phase two to do the small randomized control trials to see if there are problems. Then finally, the big phase three trials leading up to building the factories to make these vaccines, and then the manufacturing, and then the approval process, and then finally the distribution. So, what you can see in the lower portion of that screen is everything got compressed. Now, notice that nothing got skipped. So, we still have the phase one trials and the phase two and the phase three. Some of these were being run concurrently, which means at the same time. But notice something very interesting. The factories were being built at the same time that the phase one and two trials were being done. And why is that? Why were they able to do that? What the government did by stepping in and providing them money and resources, and providing those barriers is they're saying, look, we'll give you the money to build the factories, realizing that if these phase one, two, and three trials are a bust, you're not going to be held liable for the amount of money that you've spent in building these factories that aren't going to do anything. And so, that was one of the major barriers to getting this thing done was the risk that the companies would not normally be willing to take on these vaccines. But the government was saying, we don't want you to take that risk. We want you to get those things started. Now, this sort of thing has happened before. If we go back to World War II, and we talk about the Nazis and World War II, and the tremendous machinery that they had and the war machine of the Nazis, what happened was Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down with a guy by the name of William Knutson, who was basically the most powerful man in terms of Detroit and the auto manufacturing process. And he basically offered him a salary of $1 to basically coordinate the infrastructure plan to build the war machine that he would be able to go against Hitler. This is what William Knutson, the president of General Motors, said in a meeting of the executives. He said, the first half of 1941 is crucial. He said, gentlemen, we must outbuild Hitler. And that's exactly what he did. There was a point in time in Detroit where they were at the Ford manufacturing plant putting out a B-24 liberator, which is a large plane with four engines at the rate of one per hour. That was because the entire infrastructure of the United States was turned towards one goal, and that was defeating Hitler in World War II. And the same thing happened with the implementation of the project of coming forth with a vaccine. Now, some of the vaccine companies took advantage of the funds. Others did not. But the bottom line is that those barriers that created a lag time because of risk, because of money, those sorts of things were completely eliminated, and they were able to speed up the production of the vaccine. Now, phase one trial still happened. The animal studies still happened. No, the animals did not die in the production of the, in fact, it was because the animals did so well that they were able to go to phase one, two, and three. The other aspect of this that is tossed around is that this is new technology. Now, I know that Dr. Patrick knows more about the technology in terms of the history, but I will just give you a very short timeline. Back in the 1990s, we injected for the first time mRNA into the muscle cells of a mouse for the very first time. By 2005, we had modified the nucleotides, which are the signaling in that mRNA vaccine, to get around early destruction. So the problem early on was that we couldn't allow these messenger RNA molecules to last long enough to make the protein product. The problem wasn't that they lasted forever. It was that they didn't last long enough, but they were able to finally figure out how to do that. And by 2013, they started working on medications that were based on mRNA. And then finally, we had the vaccines. Here is a paper that was published in 1990. So over 30 years ago, that was for the first time showing that this technology actually had viability. And so this technology is not new. It's been around for 30 years, and it's been looked at. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dr. Patrick. I think she has some more details on this. Yes, I do. Well, in addition to this technology not being new in the sense that everyone, most people think this is the first time it's actually been used in humans, just to kind of speak to your point about the acceleration of the process of getting this vaccine into people. And you were talking about all the money that's available for building the factories. I think another really important thing to point out is the difference between this vaccine and our history of vaccines in terms of how we make them. For the mRNA vaccines, all you need is a sequence. It's all you need to make it. And it's so easy to make and math, math, math quantities versus having to actually grow vaccine and some kind of animal cell type. And like, I mean, you're limited. There's a limitation in how much of it you can make, physically limitation. So just going back to the actual history of mRNA vaccines and this mRNA technology in humans. In 2001, we have the first clinical trial of this mRNA technology that was made, it was mRNA-induced dendritic cells. In 2009, we have another clinical trial where mRNA was used as a therapeutic. In 2014, there's the first mRNA vaccine in terms of immunotherapy for cancer, so trying to treat cancer with mRNA vaccines. These are all in humans. In 2017, there were two clinical trials, one for mRNA-based vaccine for influenza and another one for mRNA technology used to treat patients with heart, basically had heart failure and they were injecting mRNA vaccines into their heart. So we've got a lot of clinical data dating back to 2001 where we've been using this technology in humans. So this is not the new technology that people in their minds, they think that this is the first time it's ever been used in humans and how scary that is. So again, it dates back to decades, a couple of decades being used in humans. And I just to kind of add to that, I really moving forward, it's amazing how this field has exploded in terms of all the clinical trials now being started and planned for this mRNA technology. There's so much interest and there's a lot of funding now to understand this technology as a therapeutic for infectious diseases in addition to the SARS-CoV-2 virus for other ones. There are now clinical studies that are now starting to look at this technology to treat genetic disorders like muscular dystrophy where there's no treatment that exists. Can you imagine being the parent of a son that has muscular dystrophy and knowing there's no treatment and having to watch your son degenerate and die? I mean, we may see a treatment for muscular dystrophy in our lifetime because of this. It's accelerated and exploded this clinical arena. We're now seeing tons and tons of trials for mRNA vaccines as immunotherapy for cancers where they're going to be injecting this mRNA technology into a variety of different types of solid tumors. And again, we may very well in our lifetime now see a cure for different types of solid tumors. Solid tumors are the type of cancers that are hardest to treat with chemotherapy because they often grow far away from blood vessels. And so blood vessels, you need them to be close to the cancer site because that's where the Kavakima therapeutic gets delivered to the tumor site. And so you'll get these tumors growing far away from them. They're what's called hypoxic. They're growing far away from blood vessels. And so it's one of the reasons why many different solid tumors are resistant to many types of chemotherapy treatments. So imagine being able to directly inject the tumor with this mRNA technology where we're going to test a variety of different immune generating molecules and things that are going to activate the immune system to go right directly to that tumor and to kill it. It's a very exciting time and I understand that people are scared because it's new to them. And it's always scary when something, you know, is new and there's change. But there's a bright side. And that bright side is that science is moving forward at an accelerated rate. And we're witnessing something that is, you know, that is that would have not have happened otherwise without this terrible pandemic that obviously a lot of bad has come out of. But, you know, to try to see the silver lighting here, the good out of it is that the science is really catapulted forward. And there's some exciting stuff going on with the mRNA technology. Thank you for that. Definitely good to have some silver linings right now. And before we sign off any items that we didn't cover that you want to. I was just going to say this Kyle is to keep in mind this image that I've got here on the screen. And that is the UK's second wave, which was non-delta, and then the third wave, which was delta. And I want the audience to keep this in mind when it comes to the vaccines and what they can potentially do. In the second wave, which is in red, the left half of that shows how quickly the infections rose as time went on. And can commonly on the other side of it, on the right side, you can see how quickly deaths, unfortunately, also rose in that second wave. And that's without the vaccines that we currently have now. And then the third wave came, which was delta wave. And what you can see there, which is a stark departure from the wave on the left, is that while you have the increasing amount of infections, which are basically positive PCRs, as we've talked about, what's missing there from that is the increased amount of deaths in that third wave. And that is with the vaccine. And that's something to keep in mind that I really want to make sure the audience understands is when you hear new stories talking about the decreased effectiveness of the vaccine. Make sure that you understand that they're talking about their ability to prevent infections. But they're what they're not talking about, at least up to this point in time. And what the Delta variant is that we're still holding on its ability to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Now, there is some data that is coming out of Israel where at least some experts believe that that ability to hold may be waning in the most elderly and in those that have been vaccinated the longest. And that's what we're talking about booster shots and things of that nature. I think that data, as we're talking right now, at the beginning of September, is still needing to be settled. The FDA is still looking at that and deciding whether or not booster shots are going to be offered into whom and when. And so we don't have the science on that settled is yet. But I still want to at least make sure that people understand that's an issue for people that have been vaccinated for six to eight months already. That's not an issue for those that have not yet been vaccinated. And our concern about where the Delta variant is especially in those states right now where Delta is raging. So I just wanted to leave that as a as a general point and as really the motivation for me and I'm sure for many others in making these kinds of videos so people can understand that. Well, thank you both so much for your time and all the information today and throughout this pandemic. Thank you for empowering people to better understand the data and the science of this pandemic and also ways that they can optimize their own health and immunity.

"COVID Delta Variant: Booster Shots, Nasal Vaccine, Rapid Testing, with Eric Topol, MD",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-08-11,haG1yKJVVAw,"Well, I'm thrilled to be here with physician, scientist, author, and professor, Dr. Eric Topel, who has been voted the number one most influential physician leader in the US by modern healthcare. He's published over 1200 peer-reviewed articles, three best-selling books, and he's now the founder and director of Scripps Research Translational Institute. And Dr. Topel, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, you've been a prolific communicator about the science as it comes in. And you have a large following, but also a very loyal following among scientists, because they know you're an optimist who's forward-thinking, but you're also willing to call anyone out at times. Big Pharma, the federal government, the FDA. So I want to start with an article that you wrote in the Guardian a few days ago titled, America is Flying Blind When It Comes to the Delta variant. For people who haven't read this article, can you summarize the main ideas? Sure. Well, first of all, thanks very much for your intro and really good to be with you. Unfortunately, we're confronting this, really the worst challenge of the pandemic, Delta. And we are not prepared, we're not tracking the data. So in that piece, I talked about the people who are in the hospital. There's over 70,000 with COVID right now in America. We have no idea how many were vaccinated. When they got vaccinated, what vaccine, how old they are, their existing condition, we should have all that data on a daily basis as just the diminimus for understanding what's going on with the dynamics of this Delta wave, which in places like Florida, Louisiana, and many other places are really just having tremendous devastating effects. How does our surveillance and our testing compare to other countries? I know we're going through this Delta wave in a similar way to the UK and Israel. How does the US stack against those countries? Yeah, well, we have a problem because we're not testing. We're less than a half of where we were in the monster third wave and we were insufficient then. We're less than a fifth of countries like Israel and the UK that are going through the Delta wave before us. So our testing is grossly inadequate. So we don't really have a good handle on the denominator of cases out there. And so between the lack of testing and the lack of use of any rapid home testing, we don't have a handle on infectiousness and the kind of critical data elements that we need to be in control, you know, to be able to have a real true assessment. Are vaccines working? How extensive are they working? What can we do to achieve best practices to get control and containment of this virus again as quickly as possible? Well, you mentioned rapid testing there and we've had Dr. Michael Menna from the Harvard School of Public Health on the show before. He's of course a big advocate for rapid testing as I know you are. Why haven't we adopted this yet in the United States? And also, could you speak to people that have heard or read in articles that, you know, rapid testing is just not as accurate as PCR and so therefore we shouldn't use it? Can you kind of address that question? Really good point, Kyle. Michael and I have been united on this front. He's been the real champion. I think in recent times he just gave up because it was hitting the wall, brick wall. The reason why it hasn't gone forward and where every household hasn't been distributed, a big set, an ample set of free rapid antigen tests that are so simple and so quick and make the diagnosis of infectiousness. The issue about lack of concords with PCR is silly because PCR picks up any virus remnants, virus copies. Whereas what we're looking at with the rapid test is do you have enough virus mass load to be infectious? It's a totally different principle and that's the guiding one so we could be so much more confident about schools. If we did this every day with each child and teacher and staff and bus drivers, that's one way we could move forward. Many countries do this frequently for free, whether it's Germany, which by the way they have as much delta 97 percent prevalent as we do and they haven't had any surge in Germany. Austria, Denmark, you know, so many countries are relying in Netherlands on rapid testing. We don't have them. I think to your question, it was because we had a vaccine centric strategy that would have worked and we would have full containment now, but then came delta. What do you think people, a lot of people don't understand about infectiousness of the delta variant or SARS-CoV-2 in general with regard to this term breakthrough infections? What does that really mean? And how realistic is it for people to think that vaccines can create this like sterilizing immunity where people don't have any virus in their nose and aren't able to spread it at all? Your points are really important, Kyle. First of all, this term breakthrough is pretty crazy because we knew that when the vaccines were remarkable in terms of their efficacy from the large trials, largest trials ever in vaccine history. They were 95 percent. So what do you want to call the 5 percent? They were breakthroughs? I mean, they're not perfect. And the problem with delta is that imperfection has been accentuated. And the reason they're not perfect is they weren't designed expected to achieve sterilization, mutual immunity. That would require an intranasal vaccine, which we haven't put the foot on the accelerator to get those out there. They're still in phase 1 early trials. So this was intended these vaccines to get prevention of severe illness and illness. That was what the endpoint was, the symptomatic infections. And they were quite good, better than expected, better than almost any vaccine in history for that endpoint. But as you aptly point out, they were not expected to fully prevent spread. Even though they did that pretty well, again, until delta came onto the scene. And there's a much more potent, higher load virus with its infections. And that's what we are confronting now. I'm glad you mentioned intranasal vaccines. You wrote a great piece about that. I believe it's in the scientific American. Could you explain that for people who are new to this concept? Could you explain some of the advantages of an intranasal vaccine, especially with this virus? Right. So with the shots, we get in our bloodstream. We get, you know, IgG antibodies to various parts of the virus, particularly despite protein. But we don't get long lasting immunoglobin A, the type of antibody that we need in our nose and upper airway. We get some of that, but that's not what it's directed. It's a blood specific strategy. The nasal vaccine is for an upper airway protection, which is how this virus gets into us. And there you are going after the coastal immunity and with this type of antibody of IgA. So they are very complimentary approaches. And had we had effective intranasal vaccines and we're using them widely. And by the way, I think they would be even more popular than shots. We would really hopefully be able to squash the even delta because that's where we're leaking in our nose and our upper airway. That's where the spread and these cases are happening among vaccinated, obviously most the vast majority are unvaccinated. But the ones that are occurring as breakthroughs are people because they don't have mucosal immunity. Now, by the way, so they don't have enough neutralizing antibodies in their blood, either many people. But what they do have is T cells and memory B cells that help protect their lungs and their body from getting hospitalizations and deaths. So that whole principle is that your cellular immunity would kick in even though you're neutralizing antibodies would fade. That works for real severe disease. But it didn't really work well for preventing these infections, post vaccination. So in other words, an intranasal vaccine, if one could be developed and put out to market, could not only prevent potentially severe COVID hospitalizations and death, but also really help curtail the spread of the virus. Exactly. We had a pretty good anti transmission strategy until delta. But if we ever needed another one, whether it's a universal sabreco virus vaccine or intranasal or both, this is the time. I mean, I wish we'd had them ready before, but you know, it's not too late. We don't know it's going to be happening after delta. I hope we won't ever see anything nearly this bad. But we should be ready. Speaking of being ready and what's next with regard to vaccines, where do you stand on this question about getting a third dose of say the mRNA vaccines, like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine at this time in the United States? Do you think we're ready for that? Do you think it should be just for certain populations of people or do you think we should hold off on that and try to develop something that targets delta variants and maybe some of the other variants that might come along? That's another really good question. And we have this problem of global inequity. And we're going to start giving boosters to everybody in our hundreds of millions of people or those vaccines get directed to places that are more desperate and haven't even had the first shot. The problem is we really need both and it does look each day increasingly likely we're going to need boosters at the least, not just for immunocompromised, but if you look at people over age 60 in Israel, who were the first get vaccines back in January. They're having you know, a considerably higher breakthrough infection rate and now that over 600,000 people in Israel over age 60 have gotten boosters of the original vaccine or not delta specific, but they're getting restoration of that really high protection because it brings up their neutralizing antibody. So I have to say I was very resistant to boosters here. I thought, oh no, we don't want to go there. Where our immunity is redundant. It'll kick in and you know, we don't want to listen to Pfizer and Moderna tell us what we need, but the data in real world data, at least from Israel. And now other countries are adopting that. It looks like that's where we're headed. The real question is whom and also when because we have no plan yet in the United States. One of the graphs that really struck me that you recently posted was about the hospitalizations in the United States compared to Israel and the UK per capita. And you mentioned that this is one of the graphs that scares you the most about this current surge in cases. Can you explain that a little more? Right. So as we discussed Kyle, the testing is so low. It's not a good parameter, but the hospitalizations, you know, that's the real deal. People are winding up in the hospital. That's our best tracking. Fortunately, the deaths are still relatively low. So hospitalizations is our real marker. Now it's like going in a car from zero to 60 in less than two seconds. I mean, our rate of rise is scary fast. We've already exceeded 70,000 and that was five X where we were five weeks ago. Now this is the fastest rate of rise in our pandemic, and this is the vaccination era. So that isn't good. The highest we've ever been is 125,000 and we're pretty substantially on that course. I never envisioned hospitalizations would get to this level and we're not done yet. I mean, since the cases are continuing to accrue, obviously some of those people are going to wind up in the hospital. It's just a lag. So without having containment of the virus or seeing any sign of a U-turn like we've seen in other countries, hospitalizations are far greater than I would have envisioned with vaccines out there, even in states that were not like, for example, Florida is on average of the United States. Does it see this happening in Florida? As you know, the worst hospitalizations of the entire pandemic, right? In Florida. That tells you something and it tells you we're just too darn vulnerable. Two part question. First of all, how contagious is this Delta variant compared to other viruses and to how has your kind of life changed since Delta variant with regard to things like mass wearing or physical distancing? Yeah, well, it's so hyper contagious, a super spread of strain if there ever was one. And you know, it's something that we are not fully appreciating that problem. And I think it's getting highlighted more and more each day when we watch these hospitalizations go up and we know that some percent, whether that's 10 percent or 15 percent whatever is even among the vaccinated fully vaccinated. So that just shows you how tough it is. No less looking at countries that are still dealing with Delta waves in Israel, for example, much more vaccinated than we are as a population. So what I'm doing and what I'm suggesting is, you know, mass, high quality, tight fit, you know, if you don't feel like your breathing is easily, that's probably a good sign. Your mask is working well and distancing and avoiding indoors. I don't now have a gathering with indoors with vaccinated people because I don't know whether they're presidomatic, asinismatic at this point. We're in the midst of this, you know, really tough wave. So I'm waiting to get on the other end of it before getting back to where we were before Delta got in here. So all these tools, the Swiss cheese model of, you know, air quality filtration, ventilation, avoiding, you know, indoors and crowds and all that stuff, we got to do that. I think now to protect ourselves. Do you think one thing that's been lost in those recommendations from the CDC in our government, you know, washing hands, ventilation, mask wearing, distancing is just taking care of our own immune systems as well, getting adequate sleep. If you're at a high body mass index, now probably a good time to start thinking about losing weight, eating healthy foods. You think that some of that's been kind of lost in the messaging? Sure. I mean, you can always suggest that. And that would be good, whether we're in a pandemic or not in a pandemic. Unfortunately, you know, I don't know that that's going to wind up being so protective right now because we got such a tough, formidable fall. But no, I absolutely that, you know, being exercising and being in this best shape is possible. Sure, it's always good advice. Dr. Topel, thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it. And again, thank you for helping communicate to everyone on your social media platforms. Your bad counts are reading have more time. No problem. Take care. Yeah, I'll do it again. Thank you."
Delta Variant Versus Previous COVID 19 Infection vs. Vaccines (Coronavirus Update 131),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-07-24,5RWGh19yTXw,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. In the previous video, we talked about the efficacy of the vaccines against the Delta variant. But there's been a lot of questions about whether or not natural immunity is sufficient for the Delta variant. If you've had COVID-19 in the past, does that natural immunity protect you from getting COVID-19 in the future, and does the Delta variant change the equation on that? Let's talk about what the data shows. So for a great real-world example, we turned to this paper that has not been peer-reviewed or published yet, but it was a study involving over 50,000 subjects at the Cleveland Clinic. On December 16th, what the Cleveland Clinic was able to do based on their subjects, 52,238, was they were able to determine that 2,579 of them before the campaign of vaccination started were already infected with SARS-CoV-2, and that 49,659 were not infected with SARS-CoV-2. Then what they did was they tracked them over the next five months, and they saw those that were vaccinated and those that were not vaccinated. And the question was, in a comparison, specifically looking very carefully at those that were infected and not vaccinated. So in other words, these people here, how did they do in comparison to those that were infected but vaccinated? In other words, was there a difference in the incidence of new COVID-19 between these two groups? So what we're seeing here on the X-axis is five months of time, so 30 days times five months is 150 days, and it starts here at time zero when they began vaccinations. And as you can see here, all of the groups, except for one, had no accumulation of incidence of COVID-19 in the not previously infected vaccinated group, in the previously infected but unvaccinated group, and in the previously infected vaccinated group. However, there was one group that did accumulate COVID-19 infections as time went on, and that was the not previously infected and unvaccinated group. As seen here on the Y-axis, which is basically showing what percent of the cohort became positive. You have 1 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, and of course that's growing with time. So in other words, by 30 days in, 3 percent of the not previously infected and unvaccinated group had turned positive for COVID-19. Now that's in contra distinction to the previously infected but unvaccinated group. They behaved very similarly to the vaccinated group, indicating that previous infection was just as good in real world data as being vaccinated. And I just want to stress again that this data was collected before the Delta variant. Another interesting article appeared in JAMA titled, Association of Vaccination and of Prior Infection with positive PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 in airline passengers arriving in Qatar. So what they did was they initiated a program looking at passengers arriving at Hamad International Airport. And they actually had about 261,000 subjects in this study. So it was a big study. And what they did was they divided into three groups. The first group was those that were vaccinated and could show documentation of vaccination. There was 31,190 subjects in that group. Then the other group was those that were not vaccinated but had evidence of previously being infected. And that was 9,180. And then they looked at the group that was not vaccinated and did not have a past history of infection. And that one was 215,911. And then they looked at the positivity rate. Yes, they had everybody take a SARS-CoV-2 test for positivity to see whether or not they were positive. And if you were to look at this in just some round numbers, the positivity rate on the vaccinated group was 0.82 percent. And that's not surprising that it would be that low because these people were all vaccinated. However, when you looked at those that were not vaccinated and had not had a history of infection, their infectivity rate was about 3.8 percent. So the question is, what would these people who were previously infected look like, even though they had no evidence of vaccination, would it be closer to these people here that were not vaccinated and never infected? Or closer to these people who were previously infected? In other words, were they getting a benefit from having a previous infection in reducing their rate of testing positive at the airport? And the answer to that was the positivity rate was about 1.0. So very close to the 0.82 and further away from the 3.8. Again, lending credence to the idea that previous natural infection to SARS-CoV-2 gives you some immunity against being reinfected. Again, the strength of this study shows in the size and the number of subjects in the study. And the one drawback of this study in terms of predicting outcomes in a delta variant world is that this data was collected between February 18th and April 26th, 2021 before the delta variant was an issue. Another great release of study is this from the United Kingdom's government titled New National Surveillance of Possible COVID-19 Re-infection, published by Public Health England. Subtitle is that new data suggest a low risk of COVID-19 reinfection in the population. And this was just released in June of 2021. So what they found was that there was 15,893 possible reinfections. But remember, the denominator here is out of 4 million people with confirmed cases. When they looked at it more closely for the data, that was narrowed down to about 478 probable infections and about 53 confirmed reinfections. And this of course led them to say the current data shows that there is a low risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. There were 15,893 possible reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 identified up to the 30th of May 2021 in England throughout the pandemic. Out of nearly 4 million people with confirmed infections, this is equivalent to around 0.4 percent cases becoming reinfected. So the risk of reinfection up to this point is extremely low. So currently we do have not only biochemical data with antibodies, but we also have real world data in terms of the strength of natural immunity for the prevention of COVID-19. However, all of that data in terms of real world data is cast unfortunately in the pre-delta world. The question is, what does the delta variant do in terms of changing the paradigm that natural immunity seems to be effective in real world data? Well, enter in this paper that was published in Nature and accepted on the 29th of June 2021, titled Reduce Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Variant Delta to Antibody Neutralization. And what we're looking here again is a surrogate for immunity in terms of the antibody response. Now, it's not just any surrogate because what we're interested in here is the ability of antibodies to neutralize the spike protein. Now, we realize that there are other aspects of the immune system that is important in neutralizing a virus. As we've talked about many times here on MedCram, there is the innate immune system, but then there's also the adaptive immune system, and there are T cells, and there are a whole host of other aspects to the immune system. So we're just looking at one aspect, but it's an important aspect because remember, notwithstanding the T cell responses and all of the other things that are involved with what a vaccine does to the immune system, one of the main purposes of the vaccine in terms of preventing infection is to make antibodies against the virus. So measuring antibody response while a surrogate is important. So let's break down the information here. This was a cohort from Strasbourg, Germany, where they had 26 subjects that were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, and they took their convalescent syrup, which basically means they took their antibodies 12 months after the onset of symptoms. And what they did was they measured the efficacy of their ability to bind the virus, and they measured it out here on this graph. Now, I looked at four different types or four different variants of the virus, the D614G, which is an older variant, the alpha, which is the UK variant, the beta, which is the South African variant, and of course the delta variant, which we're talking about in this video, and how they measured efficacy was by looking at something called the ED50. Now, the ED50 is the effective dose at which the antibodies are able to neutralize 50 percent of the virus. And so what you want here is the average response, or the average dose, which is marked here in this dark black line, you want this to be high. That means that the effective dose is quite high given the syrup from the patient, which are these antibodies. And so as you can clearly see here, whereas the alpha variant, or the UK variant, the effective dose from these subjects was high, for the beta and delta, it was low. Now, we're concerned about delta here, and not so much beta, because delta is far more infectious than the beta variant. Now, from that same cohort, they were able to take subjects again that had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2. And in this case, they looked at the response to these subjects after one dose of a vaccine. And in this case, the cohort included nine subjects who had the AstraZeneca vaccine, one dose, nine subjects who had the Pfizer vaccine, one dose, and three subjects that had the Moderna vaccine, one dose. And you can see here what just one dose of any of those vaccines did to the effective dose in these subjects for these given variants. And in just in case you are wondering, these dotted lines is the lower limit of detection for this study. Now, in another cohort, this time in Orleans, France, they looked at the same thing, except in this time, they looked at the patient's week three after the first dose of vaccination. And as you know for Pfizer, you get your second dose three weeks later. And so essentially what they're doing is they're looking at the antibody levels right before the second dose. And here's something that's very interesting. What we're looking at here is again, these variants, the D614G, the alpha, the beta, and the delta. And what you can see here is that after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, we're looking at very low levels of protection for the Delta variant, very low. Arguably lower than the natural infection levels of antibody that you would see in the cohort that we saw here in Strasbourg, Germany. However, after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, so now we're looking at eight weeks after vaccination, or week five after the second dose, you can see that these levels have actually come up pretty substantially. They also did this similarly with the AstraZeneca vaccine, and you can see very similar pictures here. So what I'm going to do here is zoom out a little bit so you can compare the question regarding the Delta variant in terms of the surrogate marker of effective dose of antibodies from convalescent plasma. If you compare someone who has been infected with the virus in the past, this is the type of effective dose that the antibodies from that type of patient is. Is going to have against the Delta variant as opposed to somebody who's been previously infected and got one dose of the vaccine versus somebody who has not gotten the infection in the past and has gotten two doses of the vaccine. And so you can clearly see here that the best case scenario for those people who have had the virus in the past is to get at least one dose of the vaccine based on this data. And for those that have not been infected to get definitely two doses of the vaccine if it suffice or one in this case or AstraZeneca. Probably the worst case scenario of course is no vaccination and never have been infected, but just above that is just getting one dose of the vaccine based on this data. The other thing that this article showed is that monoclonal antibodies that have been commercially available for patients with severe COVID-19 but not yet requiring oxygen for instance band linivimab were not very effective against neutralizing the Delta variant. And of course that's a problem because that was one of the tools that we had in the previous wave to help those patients that were early on in the infection but did not want to progress to hospitalization. The authors go on to say we further show that Delta is less sensitive to serum from naturally immunized individuals. Vaccination of convalescent individuals boosted the humoral immune response well above the threshold of neutralization. These results strongly suggest that vaccination of previously infected individuals will be most likely protective against a large array of circulating viral strains including variant Delta. And so because of that study that was published in nature there has been a call that patients who are getting the two dose vaccination from either Pfizer, Biontech or Moderna need to make sure that they get that second dose especially in a situation like we are in now where the Delta variant is becoming more and more prolific. And this is the most likely reason why we are starting to see surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations in the Midwest. And for those providers on the front line, I want to remind you that we have a library of very useful videos and taking care of COVID-19 patients whether it's learning about ventilators or relearning EKGs. I want to highlight this lung ultrasound met cram video hosted by Dr Joshua Jikeh who is actually from the Cleveland Clinic and is one of our faculty here at Meg Cram. If you want to improve your diagnostic skills and the speed at which you come up with diagnoses in terms of COVID-19 and the lungs, probably nothing will do that faster for you than an understanding in lung ultrasound. Because CT scans are difficult to use because of the cleaning that has to happen after each patient. Well, the ultrasound probe has to be clean. It's much easier to do. It's much more portable. It gives you real time information and it can be very helpful especially in analyzing the lung. So I invite you to brush up on your lung ultrasound especially with the possibility of another surge here in the United States and around the world. And for more videos visit us at medcram.com.

Coronavirus Update 130: Delta Variant and Vaccines,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-07-20,hXV7i1yxu6c,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. Just when we thought things were getting better here at least in the United States, the Delta variant has popped up and that's what we're going to talk about. But even more importantly, let's talk about variants in general. So if you've got a coronavirus and specifically the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it goes to, in fact, an individual, the issue is, as we've talked about before, the virus is going to hijack yourselves to produce many more copies of itself. In fact, in some studies, it's been shown that the virus will make up to a billion copies of itself in just one individual. But here's the problem. The way that it does it is not very accurate and so there will be some slight mistakes and you might see a variant being produced in these infections. Now variants are produced all the time. In fact, the truth is, is that most of these variants are just duds. They don't infect anything or they might not infect as well. But every now and then you might get a mutation that allows the virus to bind better to the next individual. And that would be a variant of concern, which are not very common. We have some examples. We have the UK variant, for instance, or the South African variant. And more recently, we have the Delta variant, which we're going to talk about. Now this was first discovered in India. This should not be very surprising. As you may recall, at one point in India, they were getting as many as 400,000 cases on a daily basis. Now imagine those 400,000 cases each producing over a billion copies. And you can see there that it's only a matter of time before you get a mutation that is fortuitous for the virus. And you can see here very easily that a mutation that allows the virus to infect better and be more contagious is going to be a virus that is certainly going to take over the world in terms of the different types of variants. So while there may be many different variants at once, if there is a variant that is able to infect better. That's really all that matters to the virus is to spread its genetic material as far and wide as it possibly can. That is the virus variant that is going to win in terms of the prevalence in the population. And again, this mutation that causes increased fitness can be manifested as better binding or evading the immune system. There's a number of different ways that this can happen. So as it turns out, this delta variant has some characteristics of it. And it's known as B dot 1 dot 617 dot 2. It seems that it is more contagious than the original virus. To give you an example, some experts have said that if you look at the original virus, the number of people that one person would have infected, otherwise known as the R0, it was originally around 2.5. This delta variant has been estimated anywhere between 3.5 and 4.0. Okay, so it seems to be more contagious, but where does it seem to be found the most? Well there was another paper that was published. This paper was known as the React 1 round 12 report. And while it has not been published or peer reviewed as yet, there are some interesting findings. It was put out by the Imperial College in London in the United Kingdom. And what they found is that the prevalence of the delta variant in those aged 5 to 49, in other words, those people less than 50 years of age, was 2.5 times higher compared to those that were age 50 years and above. And so while it is possible that people over the age of 50 are more likely to be vaccinated, it could also be a connection between this virus and younger aged individuals. All right, what about hospitalization? Well, there was a correspondence that was published in the Lancet regarding the delta variant. And they were able to look at PCR and what they found was surprising. What they found essentially using a Cox regression analysis, which is a way of adjusting for age sex and economic status, temporal trend, comorbidities, was that the delta variant had a 1.85 times higher risk of getting the person infected in the hospital with severe COVID-19. So if you look at SARS-CoV-2 infection since April in the United States, you'll see here that the British variant or the UK variant, the B-117, has been up to this point the most dominant infection. But as of recently, there is one that is taking over very quickly. And that is the delta variant. And as you can see, the delta variant has made some inroads very quickly here in the last two to three months. And the reason for that is because it is the most infectious variant that is currently there. In the UK, where greater than 90 percent of the cases are the delta variant, it is what is fueling the latest surge. At least 60 percent of the population is vaccinated with two doses, which is actually very good. And despite the fact that the cases have gone up in England and in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, the good news is that the corresponding deaths have not come along with that surge as yet. In Israel, where they've done a tremendous job of vaccinating primarily with the very effective Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, there has been only a small recurrence of cases at this date, most of them from the delta variant. So where we stand here in the United States is that there has definitely been a resurgence and a doubling of the number of cases, which is an early sign that there's something potentially coming. And we are seeing here on the daily deaths chart that for the first time, daily deaths have stopped going down and are now starting to creep up. In California and specifically in Southern California where I practice, there has been a recent resurgence of cases of SARS-CoV-2. Daily deaths have not yet picked up, but I can tell you anecdotally in the hospitals that I work at and in the friends that I have, some of them in LA County, there has been an increase in the number of admitted cases. For instance, one hospital where I work at had not seen COVID-19 patients in months, literally, are now admitting patients with COVID-19 and some of them are requiring high levels of oxygen. So given that, what are the tools that we have? How well equipped are we with the different vaccines that are available against this delta variant? Let's review the data up to this point. Now, we know that there are several different types of vaccines in the world. What we're going to talk about these four, mainly because we have recent data that shows the efficacy of these vaccines against the delta variant. That is the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. And they are different. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, of course, are messenger RNA vaccines, and the Oxford AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson are DNA that use Adenovirus as the vector. And if you have more questions about that, look at our previous MedCram videos on those particular vaccines for more information about how they work. Now, as you know, these three first vaccines are first and second shot, and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a one-time shot. Now, there's two different categories that I want to refer you to. And the first category that we're going to talk about is infection. So infection, what I mean by that is does the vaccine prevent the individual from being infected? And therefore, prevent them from spreading it onto somebody else that has great epidemiological importance in terms of stopping that are not number and preventing the infection from spreading epidemiologically. And of course, who wants to get sick? Nobody does. But there's another important endpoint as well, and that's hospitalization. Does the vaccine prevent the most serious complications of getting SARS-CoV-2, which is, of course, COVID-19, hospitalization, high-flow oxygen, and ventilation, ARDS, things of that nature? And so those are going to be two different numbers. So let's talk, first of all, about the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Now, I'm going to be referencing a number of articles. Some of them have not been peer reviewed, but it is recent data. I will give a link to all of these studies in the description below. So there was a UK study that showed after the first dose. So when we're talking about usually two weeks after the first dose, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine regarding the delta variant, I'm talking about the delta variant now specifically, was 33 percent effective after the first dose, and 88 percent effective after the second dose at preventing symptomatic infection. That was the UK study. Now, there was a Canadian study that came out with slightly different numbers. That was 56 percent after the first dose, and 87 percent after the second dose. There was an Israeli study that showed after the second dose, they got 64 percent. And there was a Scottish study that showed 79 percent. Now all of these are above 50 percent and would have been approved if this were the original virus. So I think these are all very good numbers. And again, we're talking about infection. Now remember that the primary way that your body prevents infection is antibodies. And we know that the mutation that has caused this variant may be slightly off enough that some people's antibody responses may not be good enough at preventing infection. But remember that one of the things that helps you prevent getting worse is T-cell activation. When T-cells are replicated in the human body, they also are replicated in a way that is not perfect. So it allows for variants in the T-cells. And so if you have variants in the virus and variants in the T-cells, that will sometimes allow for a bit of change. The T-cells can be effective at reducing hospitalizations and taking care of cells that are already infected. And therefore, what we typically find is that the hospitalization numbers are usually much better. That same UK study found that after the second dose, there was a 96 percent prevention of hospitalization and death if you got the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after the second dose. And when I say prevent here, I'm talking about efficacy. So in other words, if there's a 90 plus efficacy, that would be in comparison to a control or whether there's no vaccine, which would have a 0 percent efficacy. There was a Canadian study that looked after the first dose. There was a 78 percent reduction in hospitalization after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. And that was the Canadian study. You might be wondering why we don't have data after the second dose. There wasn't enough data points to make that available in the study so far. There was also an Israeli study that showed in terms of preventing hospitalization after the second dose that it was 93 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and death in Israel. So the bottom line here for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is that despite the fact that Delta is more infectious and causes potentially more hospitalization, Pfizer is exceptionally good at preventing hospitalization and death from the Delta variant. What about Moderna? Well, there was a Canadian study that showed that after the first dose, there was a 72 percent reduction. And that was the Canadian study. In that same study, after the first dose, the Moderna vaccine was 96 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and death. Now the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, which has been given authorization in the UK after the first dose, they found it to be 33 percent effective at preventing infection and after the second dose, 60 percent effective. That was the UK study. In Canada where it's approved, they found that after the first dose, it was 67 percent effective at preventing infection and that in Scotland, after the second dose, it was again 60 percent effective at preventing infection. Now what about hospitalization? Well, in that UK study, they found that it was 93 percent effective after the second dose, preventing hospitalization. In the Canadian study that they looked at, it was 88 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and death if you took the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccination. So again, very good numbers at preventing the worst outcomes. Now what about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine? That's a one time shot. What they found is we don't have studies currently that look at the efficacy, but we do have some Syrigates that could be very informative. Now the Johnson and Johnson vaccine was tested against the most strenuous variant or the worst variant at the time back about six months ago and that was the South African variant. And when they tested the antibody response of the Delta variant in comparison to the South African variant, what it showed was that there was a higher level of antibody response to the Delta variant than there was even to the South African variant. In other words, a very good antibody response to the Delta variant. You may recall the South African variant with respect to the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. There were no people who were hospitalized or died of the South African variant 49 days after they received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. In fact, Johnson and Johnson put out a statement saying that as time went on, the immunity got better up to even eight months after the Johnson and Johnson vaccination. So because these vaccinations are so good at preventing hospitalization and death and also reasonable at preventing infection, your risk from the Delta variant is going to be predicated on a couple of things. Number one, it's going to be predicated on whether or not you're vaccinated. So it's also going to be predicated on the amount of people in your area that are vaccinated. If there's a high frequency of vaccination in the population around you, then you're going to be more protected. And of course, the question also is, is how prevalent is the Delta variant in your community as well? So here's a nice article that actually looks at those key points. If you look at this map from the data, that's available. You'll see here that the areas that are in light gray are where there is 40 plus percent vaccinated or below case count threshold. And for those that have the dark orange, as you can see here, this is where there is a low vaccination rate less than 40 percent and also an elevated case count. So this is where if you are living in a county that is orange on this map in the United States, that's where you might be concerned about the prevalence of the Delta variant in your community. And if you want more information, I highly recommend going to the CDC COVID data tracker, which gives you up to date information in your county and also your state. I know this seems like a very small increase at this time. The purpose of this video is not to scare you, but it's to get you prepared. As we get into the fall, there are a number of factors that could be in play. There is a change in humidity. There is the change in daylight hours, vitamin D production, being indoors versus outdoors. All of these may play a role in the resurgence of a potential Delta wave. I've gotten an increase amount of personal phone calls from friends and family members who have told me that their loved ones have tested positive for COVID and I'm seeing it more often. And if you do get COVID, I highly recommend watching our video on 10 tips if you get COVID-19. In this video, we go over in detail the types of things that you want to make sure that you are doing to give yourself the best shot at surviving COVID-19. And as I go back to work, I really don't want to see a repeat of what we had to witness in January and February of this year. Since the vaccination campaign has started, I have not seen a single COVID-19 case in my intensive care unit that have been vaccinated. All of the cases that I am seeing in the hospital currently at this time are patients that did not get the COVID-19 vaccine. I'd like for all of you out there to remain safe, get plenty of sleep, boost your immune system. Thanks for joining us."
Johnson and Johnson Vaccine Pause: A Rare Blood Clot Called Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-04-14,qFIxMGWrfTQ,"Dr. Schwal, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and blood clots, that's the big news story of the day and the FDA and CDC has temporarily paused the administration of that vaccine in the United States. Can you give us an overview of what's going on and then I want to get to a lot of questions about details on what this means for people who have already had the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, people who are planning on getting that vaccine and would also love for you to illustrate. What's going on with this particular type of blood clot at the anatomical level, but to start, could you just give us an update on what's going on with this news story? Yes, thanks Kyle. So as you know, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was the third vaccine in the United States to get emergency use authorization that was given at the end of February beginning of March. Since that time, about 6.8 million doses have been given in the United States and during that time there is a reporting system called the VA ERS where they've been keeping track of adverse reactions and during this time there have been about six patients that have developed something called cerebral venus sinus thrombosis or CVST for short. And in the FDA's review of those six individuals, all of whom are women between the age of 18 and 48 who develop these complications between six and 13 days post vaccination. One of them has died, the other one is in critical condition. And because of that, the FDA has put the vaccination campaign on pause has not mandated that vaccination stop with the vaccine. But because of the serious nature of these thrombosis, they wanted to investigate that. But I think what we need to do is talk a little bit more about exactly what CVST is. And so I think instead of talking about it, I'd rather illustrate it for you. So we know that blood has to go to the brain and that actually comes through the carotid artery right here. And it goes up and it splits off and we won't get into the anatomy of that. But the point is is that the blood from the body goes to the brain and supplies the neurons and the brain with oxygenated blood. After that happens, the blood then collects into this system that you see here in blue. And depending on what part of the brain we're talking about, there's different venus structures. And so these are known as sinuses because they don't have the typical musculature, albeit rudimentary, that you would see in normal veins. And so we have different types of venus structures, all of which drain blood back to a central location. And you can see that here as the blood flows back, it flows down and then back eventually to the heart. So eventually it's going to end up here in one of two internal jugular veins. We have the sigmoid sinus here, we have the occipital sinus, the transverse sinus, the straight sinus. And at the top here we have the superior sagittal sinus. So what can happen is you can get a clot that forms. And if you have a clot that forms, it's going to cause an obstruction to flow. And you will start to see enlargement and an increase in back pressure in these venus structures. And those will then cause back pressure on that part of the brain that is being drained by these veins. So let's talk about the symptoms. One of the biggest symptoms, and of course it's not very specific, is a headache. Another possible symptom is abnormal vision. Symptoms of a stroke. So this would be where one side of the body is not working as well as the other that could happen on the face or in the limbs or even in the legs. And then finally seizures. Now again, this is happening because there has been a thrombosis or a clot that is formed in any one of these sinuses or veins. Other important factors that you should know is that it's much more common in females than it is in males, almost a three to one ratio. It's also more common in obesity and in a younger patient, think about this type of diagnosis. Because you're trying to find a very delicate area and you're trying to detect whether or not there is an increase in pressure in size before the thrombosis, the best way to make the diagnosis is with a MRI. And something called an MRV, V standing for vein, which is in the name CVST. So MRI, MRV, if there is concerns. That was really helpful to visualize what cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is. But does that condition cover exactly what's going on here with this potential thrombosis from the Johnson-Johnson vaccine? And how does this type of blood clot or thrombosis compare with what we've seen with the AstraZeneca vaccine? Those are very good questions. So if we go back to the numbers, Kyle, there have been over 6.8 million doses given here in the United States. Despite that very high number, that represents less than 5 percent of the total number of doses that have been given out here in the United States. And with the six cases that we're looking at here, that's about a 1 in a million shot at getting this complication. So one might ask, well, why are they making a big deal out of something that's just 1 in a million? And it boils down to the first question that you ask. How is this different? It's different in the sense that there is something more than just a thrombosis. There is low platelets. And that is a concern about how this condition would be treated, especially if more cases came up. What they are thinking here, what they are understanding is that there may be a situation where antibodies are being made against the platelets, and also something called a platelet factor 4, which causes the platelets to drop out of circulation. And at the same time, activate what the platelets release, causing a pro thrombotic event. For those that are in the medical field, they might recognize this is something very similar to what we call heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome. This is where even though the platelets, which are responsible for coagulation and the initiation of coagulation, even though they are low, you would think that that would cause more bleeding. In fact, it causes the opposite. It causes thrombosis not only in the venous system, but also in the arterial system. And if you do see this type of a situation, what is important to understand from a medical care standpoint is that the use of heparin in these types of situations is actually contraindicated and could make things worse. So if you are seeing clots as a healthcare provider, especially after someone has been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the reason why they wanted to discuss this and they got this out there was to make sure that not to use heparin products. Now you asked about how this might be similar or different to the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccination that is not approved in this country. It is not given emergency use authorization, but currently does is being used in Europe where it is being investigated also for blood clots as well. In fact, there was a paper that was just recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine asking this very question and reviewing a number of cases. And they also seem to see a situation where antibodies are being formed against platelets and this platelet factor for which is causing a pro thrombotic state and also low platelets as well. And again, they are advocating in that paper as well as here in the United States that if we see those type of cases as we would do in heparin induced thrombocytopenia not to use heparin products but rather other anticoagulants. In addition to by the way, something called IVIG or intravenous immunoglobulin, this is an antibody that binds these antibodies that are being made so that they cannot produce the type of negative effects. Again, this is a one in a million shot. This is a very rare side effect that they are seeing, but they are seeing it both potentially in AstraZeneca in Europe and here with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the United States. And we'll talk a little bit more about what these numbers really mean. But I think the key point here is they wanted to be out of an abundance of caution even though this is six cases out of six plus million doses. They wanted to make sure that healthcare workers were understanding of this, aware of this so that they could be looked at and they could be a surveyed and treat them appropriately. You mentioned that the FDA and CDC made this decision about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine out of an abundance of caution, that was certainly one of the talking points for public health officials today. I put together a slide that shows some of the relative risk of a blood clot potentially from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine versus other things and was wondering if you could walk us through that. Yes, so rebarol venous sinus thrombosis is not something that is new. It's been around. It can happen. As we talked about, it tends to happen more in women than in men. But if you were to look at the general population, what would be the chances of somebody coming down with a case of CVST? And if you look at this, the general population is about 0.5 per 100,000 per year. Actually, if you were to come down with COVID-19, the relative risk there is 4.5 to 20 per 100,000 cases of COVID-19. Obviously in women who are pregnant, there is a hyper-colligateable state associated with that. And again, we see about 10 to 12 per 100,000 deliveries can develop CVST. Oral contraceptives are well known to cause a hyper-colligable state. And we can see a wide range of increased risk there at 2.7 to 40 people per 100,000. And so what we're looking at here, when we're talking about 6.8 million doses given and 6 individuals coming down with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, we're looking at potentially 0.09 people per 100,000 vaccines given. If you're looking at about 1 in a million, another way of looking at this, Kyle, is about 115 million people every day get into automobiles and travel. And of those 115 million people, 16,000 of them get into some sort of a car accident or fender bender. And unfortunately, every single day 100 people die in automobile accidents. So if you look at those numbers, that's also about a 1 in a million chance, maybe slightly less, very similar to the chances that we're talking about here with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. So you mentioned the VAERS or vaccine adverse event reporting system. Can you explain more about what that is and some of the misunderstandings about this reporting system? Yeah, so basically it's a clearinghouse where anybody can put in information about what may have happened after a vaccine was given. And it's a way, it's a clearinghouse and it's a repository of information so that scientists and vaccine experts can look over this and see whether or not there is a signal that shows that above the population level, above the baseline level that we would normally see, there is a problem that needs to be investigated. You know, look, if you were to follow 100,000 people for a year, just that random 100,000 people for a year, at the end of that year, 700 people would be dead in that cohort. And that's just based on all cause mortality. That's the happens to be the all cause mortality here in the United States. And so anytime you take a population and follow it, things are going to happen. People are going to get sick and people are going to die. And so the question is, is when these things get fed into the system, when you look up on the VAERS and you see that there are certain adverse reactions, things that have happened, the assumption is to think at least initially that these are all the things that have happened as a result, as a cause of getting or as a result of getting the vaccine. When that's not necessarily the case, it's associated in these same individuals. But then the hard work of understanding statistics and epidemiology to figure out whether or not there is a higher than normal frequency of these events starts. And that's where they are right now looking at these adverse reactions. So a big question that's out there right now is people who have already had the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Is there anything in particular they should be doing or looking out for? And also people that were scheduled or planning on getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. What should they be doing right now? Yeah, well, first of all, if you're scheduled to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a number of cases, they've already switched those out to either the Pfizer, BioNTech vaccine or the Moderna vaccine. If they haven't, they've already probably notified you. And we anticipate that this pause in the campaign for vaccination by the federal government is going to be paused for a couple of days and we'll hear more information very soon about where that's going to go. Now, if you've already gotten the vaccine, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and it's been less than two or three weeks since you've gotten it. If it's been more than two to three weeks that you probably have nothing to worry about because these things all popped up within two weeks of vaccination. And when I say worry, again, it's a one in a million shot, it seems, but it's always wise to look out for some of the signs of this type of complication. And what would that be? A CVST or cerebral venous thrombosis would be the kind of things that you'll be interested in looking at is headaches that are continuous constant, double vision, weakness on one side of the face or the other or even in the arms or legs or even seizures as we've talked about before. So these are warning signs to go and seek medical attention in the emergency room. If that's happening, of course, let the providers there in the emergency room know that you are a recipient of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. So far, you've really focused on the blood clots that can happen in the brain, but can clotting from this condition happen other places in the body as well? Absolutely. It's interesting to me that that almost all of these cases focused on the cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, but absolutely Kyle, you can get blood clots in the lungs. You can get blood clots in the organs of the abdomen. You can get blood clots in the legs. All of those, of course, have different symptoms. Let's start with the lungs first. It would be a sensation of sudden shortness of breath and what we call shortness of breath on exertion. The other symptoms could be abdominal pain, epigastric that would be sort of above your belly button, continuous abdominal pain there. If it was in your legs, then you would have pain in your legs either on one side or on both if there was clots on both sides of your legs. And you might even see swelling, particularly at the end of the day when you're walking around. So these are all danger signs that you need to go to the hospital and be checked out in the emergency room. And of course, let them know about your vaccination history. We know that all six cases have happened in women from the age 18 to 48. Why do you think that's the case? That's a very good question. We don't know what their uses of oral contraceptive medication. I know they're investigating that. That would be an added risk factor in terms of thrombosis. But if you look at this two different ways, if this is an immune related thrombosis or if it is a hypercoagulable related thrombosis in both of those situations, women typically are at higher risk. Women's immune systems are generally more robust than men's. This is the reason why men had a more difficult time with COVID-19 in the hospital in terms of mortality and morbidity over women. And in this situation, women are more likely to get antibodies autoimmune conditions. We see that disparity in all sorts of autoimmune conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions. So it's certainly possible that that is what we're seeing. There is some data out of the out of Europe that is looking at the AstraZeneca vaccine and the thrombosis there. They also are seeing a predominance in female over male and also younger as well. And again, there is the specter that is raised of a autoimmune situation. So I think that's primarily the two reasons why I would say that we are seeing women represented disproportionately here in these complications. In the news cycle today, public health officials in the US were very quick to point out that there has been no increased safety signal in the mRNA vaccines. Do you agree with that? Do you think that people should proceed as normal with the mRNA vaccines at this time? Yeah, absolutely. Even though there is only a one in a million chance so far based on these results of getting CDST, we have an alternative that hasn't shown that signal in any way, shape or form. And that's the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines. There is some interesting data that's looking at why that might be the case. The two vaccines that have shown a potential increase in blood clots is the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine. And of course, the Johnson and Johnson, both of those use an endenovirus vector to get the DNA into the cells to make the spike protein. As you know, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines don't use the endenovirus at all. They use lipid droplets to get the messenger RNA into the cells to produce the spike protein. And again, we have not seen any sort of increase risk of blood clots and they're not under any kind of investigation for this. And so, yes, absolutely. If people are interested in getting a vaccine and they have been concerned about this development, I would definitely direct them over to the remaining two vaccines that are currently available in this country. Of course, this decision that the CDC and the FDA made to pause the Johnson and Johnson vaccine temporarily has been controversial. There's been strong arguments on both sides, a well-known economist and statistician named Nate Silver has been very critical of this decision from a pure stats and numbers standpoint. And then public health officials and scientists on the other side are saying, absolutely, this is the right call. When you get a safety signal like this, it's really important to investigate it and it helps build public confidence in the vaccine process. So, of course, vaccine hesitancy is a potential problem in the United States right now. What's your opinion on all this? Do you think the FDA and CDC made the right call? Do you think this will make vaccine hesitancy potentially worse? Yeah, it's a very good question. And I struggle with this. I guess we'll find out for sure depending on how things go. But I can certainly see somebody at home thinking, should I get the vaccine? Should I not get the vaccine? And then this news comes out that's kind of spooky. And you say, you know what? I'm going to hold off at this point because I don't know what's going on. And I don't know. And therefore, that could be obviously a bad thing, a negative thing if you're trying to get people vaccinated. Of course, there's the other side of it where people are like, you know, I don't really trust the FDA. I don't know if they're doing what they need to be doing. You know, if they're not watching this very carefully and certainly after today with just, you know, a one in a million chance potentially obviously six people who get CVST is six people too many. But obviously things happen and we're vaccinating hundreds of millions of people. These sorts of things pop up and to know that the FDA is monitoring this and they're willing to actually put a stop to an active vaccine campaign. And I'll just clarify there that they haven't mandated that everybody stop a physician and a patient if they choose to get a Johnson and Johnson vaccine can still do that. But in terms of federally operated vaccine campaigns, they have stopped using the Johnson and Johnson at least temporarily here. You know, to think that they're actually willing to do that based on a small signal such as this could lead some confidence to people that yes, the people at the top are monitoring things and looking at this. You know, and that's purely from a PR standpoint. I mean, from a medical scientific standpoint, it's absolutely the right thing to do if you want to make sure that you're not harming people unnecessarily. It's an interesting thing, Kyle, because right now in this country, if we had nothing else, if we just had one vaccine, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, it would be a much more difficult decision to do. But, you know, we have choices at this point. We have three different choices to choose from. And if one of these things does increase the risk unnecessarily, then we can always fall back on the other two. And I'm happy to say, and I've seen some differences in this, but I'm happy to say from what I've read, it seems as though there is enough supply and there's enough room there for Pfizer, biotech and Moderna to increase their supply to take up the difference again less than 5 percent of the vaccines currently in this country that have been delivered into arms is from Johnson and Johnson. For someone watching this, who may be on the fence about getting vaccinated, and then they see this news about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, and they may be decide, well, I probably won't get it at this point. What information would you share with them about where we are in the pandemic and the risks of COVID-19 at this time? Yeah, so we've had increasing cases in places like Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, and we are on a race, basically a race to suppress the current wave of infections here in the United States. Obviously, there are countries around the world that have it much worse than we do, such as Brazil and now emerging as India. And so long as there are places in the world, we're never going to be safe. And so my recommendation is to get vaccinated if you're able to do so. And if you look at the recent data, Kyle, that was published on the CDC website just about a week ago, it showed that the Pfizer, biotech and the Moderna vaccines were 80 percent effective at preventing infection after the first dose. So the second dose that went up to 90 percent. So that was a real world example in terms of efficacy at preventing asymptomatic transmission of the virus. And if there's one thing that will shut down a pandemic real fast, it's if that virus can't spread to somebody else. So to clarify, do you still think the best path back to avoiding lockdowns, getting back to large gatherings of people and moving to a better place with this pandemic is vaccination at this time? Well, there's, yeah. So basically there are things that we can do for ourselves and that there are things that we can do for other people. The things that we do for ourselves is to make sure that our immune system is the strongest that it can possibly be. And we've talked about that in terms of sleep, in terms of supplements, in terms of making sure that you've got good nutrition and on all of those things. And that's part and parcel about what we need to do for our own bodies because, you know, the vaccine will take care of this pandemic. But we want to also make sure that our bodies are strong. But in terms of those people that can't get the vaccine or for those of us that even though our bodies are in great shape and we're doing very well, we will only know if we've transmitted the virus after the fact. And so there's asymptomatic spread. And so the way to reduce that is vaccination, but also testing if that's available and also distancing and mask wearing. So these are all things that we can do here in this emergency situation to cut down and spread, cut down on the spread of the virus. Kyle, just to finish up on that point, if you look at what's going on in Michigan, where they've done a very good job at vaccinating the older population. Now what they're starting to see with this recent outbreak, 50 percent of the patients are under the age of 50. Many of them without comorbidities. So you can be as healthy as you want to be. But still there is a chance that COVID-19 might not kill you, but it could give you long term COVID symptoms, loss of smell, loss of taste and those sorts of things. So it's there is there is benefit all the way around. Well, Dr. Schwault, thank you as always for explaining this important event and illustrating it. And we'll see you soon for another update, I'm sure. Thanks, Kyle."
"Coronavirus Update 126: Variants, Vaccine Uptake, Sinovac, Brazil, India, Israel",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-04-12,orFHqNwz4kQ,"Welcome to another Make Cram COVID-19 update. In terms of daily new cases in the United States, we've come down considerably and reached the plateau. And that's because of some heterogeneity. There's been some increasing in cases in places like Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Florida. And there's been some decreases in California and in Texas. Overall, daily new deaths in the United States continue to drop. Places that we've been watching very carefully include Brazil, where daily new cases are still very high. And daily new deaths in Brazil are at an all-time high. And the major concern down in Brazil is the infrastructure. Their hospitals are at capacity and they're having a difficult time taking care of the patients that they need to take care of. But in addition to Brazil, another hotspot that has come up here in the last couple of weeks is definitely India. And as you can see here, the number of cases in India are at an all-time high. Deaths have started to increase in India and there's a concern about what is going on in that part of the world. And there are a number of reasons for this, according to a recent Reuters story titled, India's daily COVID-19 cases rise to record for fifth time this week. The story says the government has blamed the resurgence mainly on crowding and a reluctance to wear masks as businesses across the country have reopened since February, only to be partially shut again to control the current surge. Quote, mask gatherings for elections and religious events have accelerated COVID for which all of us are responsible to some extent. Sonya Gandhi, the chief of the main opposition congress party, said in a statement. In Mumbai, hundreds of poor migrant workers crammed into trains this week to flee, potentially risking a wider outbreak in smaller towns and villages. The Railways Department called it a usual rush this time of year for people to harvest crops back home and celebrate festivals. What's ironic is that India is the largest vaccine maker in the world. And so far it's administered close to 100 million doses using primarily the AstraZeneca shot and also another homegrown shot by Barat Biotech. And because India's pharmaceutical industry is so large and since they export so many medications, what they are doing now is they are outlying the exports of some of those medications so that they can help their own people. One of those medications this week that was no longer being exported is Remdesivir. And this man has been in place until quote, till the situation improves. Interestingly, the WHO in November of 2020 issued a conditional recommendation against the use of Remdesivir in hospitalized patients because their randomized control trial did not show much benefit. However, many countries, including India, are still using Remdesivir as part of their treatment options for COVID-19. We will definitely need to watch the situation both in Brazil and in India as things develop here in the next couple of weeks. And if you're interested in following how vaccination campaigns are going around the world, I think this is a great tracker that's found at Bloomberg.com and we'll go ahead and leave the link for you here in the description below. But as you can see here, 768 million doses have been administered across the world. They also give you an update here of what's happening in the United States. Here in the United States, we have 28.5 percent of the population coverage, 183 million doses given. As we see in look at India, they are close to 101 million doses given, but because they have well over a billion in population, that's only 3.7 percent of the population. In Brazil, we have 29 million doses given at 6.9 percent population coverage and in some other areas here in South America, we can see here 12 million with nearly 31.4 percent of the population coverage in Chile. Many of you have asked about other types of vaccines. We've talked here on Medcramp about the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine, and also the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. We're going to talk a little bit about the Cinevac vaccine. Cinevac is a private Chinese company that developed their coronavirus vaccine version called coronavirus. We're going to talk about the mechanism of how that works. So basically, we have SARS-CoV-2 and as you know, we have the spike protein and this is what binds to the ACE2 receptor on your cells when the virus goes into your body. And inside the virus, we have the RNA. The RNA codes for the information when the virus infects your cells so that the cells make more viral particles and they can infect more cells in your body. So what Cinevac does is they made their corona vaccine or corona vac simply by taking corona virus from multiple countries and looking at them to see what was the most representative. They took eventually one from China and since it already had the spike proteins on the virus, all they had to do was destroy the information to the cells that were telling the cells how to make more viral particles. They did that by adding a chemical called beta-propial lactone. And what this chemical does is it basically goes in and inactivates the messenger RNA so that it can't be used inside of the cells. And then they took this inactivated virus and combined it and put it into a vaccine and added aluminum as an adjuvant. And that word adjuvant simply means it's something that's added to the vaccine to stimulate the recipient's immune system more to recognize that something foreign is there. And this is essentially what they have as their vaccine is what they inject into the recipients. And we're going to talk about some of the results from the trials that have gone on around the world on this vaccine. Now remember, since they used a virus from China, it was very similar to the original virus that came out of Wuhan, China at the beginning of the pandemic. And so the variants that we've seen around the world, like the variant that was first discovered in South Africa and the variant that was first discovered in the UK and the variant that was discovered in Brazil first, they're going to be slightly different than the spike protein here on this particular coronavirus that was used for coronavirus. And that's important to understand because as was published here on the BBC News with this article titled Cinevac, Brazil results show Chinese vaccine 50.4 percent effective. You'll have to realize that of course Brazil is a country with a very large proportion of their coronavirus infections with the P1 or the Brazilian variant. So we have some results and some of them are subdivided. For instance, when we look at the data that's come out of Brazil, they initially had reported for mild and severe cases an efficacy of 78 percent. However, when they added to that the very mild cases, they found that in those cases, the overall efficacy was 50.4 percent. And that may be as we've discussed, a result of the fact that Brazil has a lot of variants and specifically the Brazilian variant, which may not be as similar as it could be to the original virus that was discovered in China. Now there have been some other trials, for instance in Turkey, that showed that the efficacy there was 91.25 percent in terms of cases. And in Indonesia, recently it was shown at 65.3 percent. This data is also very interesting when you consider what's going on in Chile. Now if you notice here in Chile, there's 12 million doses that have been given. And that's enough for 31.4 percent of the population, very similar or even higher than that here in the United States. And yet if you look and see what's going on in Chile, you'll see that cases are actually increasing and have been at an all-time high despite that level of vaccination. And according to this article, more than 93 percent of those in Chile who have gotten both shots received the Cinevac vaccine. Other vaccines that are also approved in Chile include the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, and also just recently added to that list was the Kansino single dose vaccine. So as we look at the numbers, I think the three countries to watch carefully would be Brazil, India, and Chile in terms of how things turn with respect to the policies of vaccinations and precautions. We've talked about in those countries, there will be a strain on the healthcare system, and many patients who will be waiting while they have been infected with COVID-19 before they can get to the hospital. For that, I recommend watching our 10 tips video on COVID-19. And for those who are taking care of patients on ventilators, our free ventilator course on how to manage patients on the ventilator. So let's turn to Israel where they have done a tremendous job at vaccinating quite a bit of their population. If we look at Israel, we can see here that 10 million doses have been given and enough for 56.5 percent of the population coverage, and that is probably the highest in the world if not very close to it. A very small percentage of the infections going on in Israel right now are related to the South African variant. Most of the surge that was seen prior to this last round with vaccination was due to the UK variant. And this study, which was reported on in the times of Israel, shows that there is some interesting data that is contrary to some of the Pfizer data in terms of the South African variant being able to break through the Pfizer vaccine. And this is the pre-print that will be published. Here we perform the case control study that examined whether vaccines with the Pfizer biotech vaccine would documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to become infected with the B-117 or the UK variant or the B-1351 or South African variant compared with unvaccinated individuals. Vaccines infected at least a week after the second dose were disproportionately infected with the B-1351 with an odds ratio of 8 to 1. Those infected between two weeks after the first dose and one week after the second dose were disproportionately infected by the B-117 or the UK variant, suggesting that reduced vaccine effectiveness against both variants of concern under different dosage timing conditions. Nevertheless, the B-1351 or the South African variant incidence in Israel to date remains low and vaccine effectiveness remains high against the B-117 among those fully vaccinated. So of course, to keep in mind that the way that this study was designed is not to look at the efficacy of the Pfizer biotech vaccine. On the contrary, this was looking at positive results to see which types of variants had come through and made up those positive values. And so again, it's important to understand that this study really can't study and look at the true efficacy of a vaccine, which clearly no vaccine is 100 percent effective. And as we've seen in other variants, escape from the vaccine typically is seen in the more milder infections and not in hospitalizations. And in this study, we really didn't get a chance to see where these South African variants were seen, where they seen in asymptomatic patients or where they seen in hospitalized patients. And we don't know the answer to that based on these results. And here you can see with their news release, Pfizer and BioNTech confirm high efficacy and no serious safety concerns through up to six months following second dose in updated top line analysis of landmark COVID-19 vaccine study. And you can see here that they said that the vaccine was 100 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 cases in South Africa, where the B-1351 lineage is prevalent. Despite all of that, there is an article here in the Times of Israel stating that serious COVID cases in Israel fall below 300 for the first time since early December. And only 0.5 percent of tests come back positive, the lowest rate in almost a year. So in addition to those other three countries that we talked about, Israel is also a notable case to look at very carefully because perhaps more than any other country on the planet, they have rolled out the vaccine faster and with the highest amounts of vaccination than just about any other country. Over the next few weeks, what we will be needing to watch very carefully is what happens in Brazil with currently 29 million doses given and only 6.9 percent of the population covered with the vaccine. And this may be why the deaths have soared in Brazil to the point where they are essentially number two in the world right behind the United States in terms of total deaths at 332,000 that puts them at 159 deaths per 100,000 population. According to the article, it looks as though the president is now turning his focus to a nationwide vaccination drive, something that many critics say has been lacking up until this point. If you look at intensive care occupancy in Brazil, you'll see here that they are overflowing. We in January and February of this year in Southern California were also in a situation very similar to this. It puts a lot of strain on healthcare personnel and it's very disheartening. This is not the only place in the world where this is happening. If you are listening to this and you're in those parts of the world, I highly recommend that you look at our MedCram update 59, which talks about supplements that I was taking during the pandemic. Also look at our 10 tips for COVID-19. And for those of you who are healthcare providers, go to MedCram.com for more information about how to manage ventilators in patients with COVID-19. This is a very critical point in the pandemic. I thank you for joining us."
Antibody Dependent Enhancement: What Is It? Does it Occur With COVID 19 Vaccines?,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-03-29,fhTidqt5tAE,"There's another concept that's been floating around on the internet about antibody dependent enhancements. Could you explain what that is and if you think that's kind of relevant to this discussion about COVID-19 vaccines? So yes, it's actually unlike the sort of fertility story. This is something that at the beginning of the vaccine development pathway was taken very seriously and all the trials were designed to find if there had been a problem with this. And for the vaccines that have been approved so far, there hasn't been. But what it is is basically the idea that if you have an antibody response to something and I'm going to give you the example of dengue hemorrhagic fever because this is one of the places where we know that it does happen. So if you have an antibody response to a particular pathogen and later on you meet a version of that pathogen that is sort of similar but not quite the same. What can happen is that the antibodies that aren't quite good enough to wipe it out can cause it to be taken up by for example macrophages which are kind of a mean cell that gobble up things which allow it to be taken around the body and can cause the virus to spread. And so that does actually happen for example with dengue and the reason it was potentially concerned for this virus was because we know that some of the animal coronaviruses. I think it's the feline enteric coronavirus have been really difficult to design vaccines against because whenever they do design a vaccine, the vaccine actually tends to cause antibody dependence enhancement rather than wiping out the virus. So it wasn't potential concern when we were developing the vaccines but the trials were designed to detect if vaccination gave you worse disease rather than protecting you from disease. And we see it really clearly that the vaccines protect you from disease rather than making that disease worse. So it seems that there's no antibody dependent enhancement effect going on here."
"COVID Variants vs. Coronavirus Vaccines (AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson) + Immunity",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-03-25,6aOMs1loXN0,"Professor Crottie, thank you for coming back to the show to address some of the most important and frequently asked questions about COVID-19. In previous discussions, you've talked a lot about immune memory, how well do our bodies remember viruses that we've been exposed to? And anyone watching this video essentially falls into one of three categories. You've already had COVID-19, you've been fully vaccinated, or you've had neither. So I'm looking forward to hearing your interpretation of the current data and what we know about each of these categories. How long will immunity last? Will it hold up to the variants? And perhaps most important, what do answers mean for policy decisions and prevention strategies, like physical distancing, opening businesses, and mask wearing, which was highlighted in a recent heated exchange between Senator Rand Paul and Dr. Fauci, both of whom cited your work professor that was recently published in the journal Science. We'll try to cover all of those things, but I want to start with this graphic. So group A, people who have had and recovered from COVID-19, what do we know about their immunity to this virus?The executive summary is we know that those people have a measurable immunity and there are essentially two categories of studies for measuring that ones that type of study that we do, which is laboratory measurements. And then the other type of study is population-based studies of trying to measure who gets sick again. And so there's data from both of those types of measurements that there's substantial immunity for at least six months after somebody's had COVID-19 on average and we can get into that on average, caveat. There's no simple measurement of immunity that works for all viruses. The immune system is complicated, the immune system has to control different viruses in different ways. And so we're still learning how the immune system protects you against this disease. And so what we and others have done is collected data and again, two different categories. So the one that we did was laboratory measurements. So saying, okay, let's take our group and Alex said his group upstairs and Daniel Weisscoff, so the three of us who are faculty here in LJ, we said, all right, let's take a group of people who have recovered from COVID-19 and ask, do they have immune memory? And so it is that immune memory is a lot like brain memory. It's something your body does to remember something. It's been its experience in the past. And we were starting from a perspective of people being worried, is there memory at all against this virus? And so context matters. So he said, okay, we'll gather together about 200 people who have had this disease and ask if their immune system did in fact remember it. We did that over an eight month period of time because, well, because time matters. So for lots of infections, people's memory to the infection fade some over time. So whether we measured antibodies or other parts of the immune system, the memory B cells and the various T cells, on average, people had what we considered a significant amount of memory to this virus. And what we could do is measure over time what happened to that memory, right? So the memory does drop over time. But it was a relatively slow drop over time. So between the time of infection in eight months, we considered it a reasonable drop, pretty normal compared to other infections. And so all together, from those data, those are laboratory measurements, which Tony Fauci brought up in that discussion. Okay, the studies that you quote from Cradi and Sete look at in vitro examination of memory immunity, which in their paper they specifically say this does not necessarily pertain to the actual protection. It's in vitro. And what we can do with those laboratory measurements is make some inferences, but they don't directly show protection. But they provide us some other useful things, right, about which parts of the immune system and sort of the change over time. The complimentary study, our population based study is saying, okay, let's take a large group of people who have had COVID-19 and ask, do they get infected with the virus again? And if they do get infected with the virus again, do they get symptomatic infection or is it just a small asymptomatic infection? And there have now been a number of good studies like that. One that was in the discussion was a UK study that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a very good study that showed very little reinfection after six months. There was a much larger UK study of nurses and that's somewhere between, I think, like 83 percent in 90 percent percent protection from reinfection, depending on the exact definition. There was a big study in Qatar, a man-air recent study in Denmark. That's the largest such study involving millions of recorded events and again over something like a six months period of time, which also showed substantial protection against reinfection, but not perfect protection from reinfection. And I think the most interesting thing that Denmark study now adds in the past two weeks is that they could see that people over 65 were at greater risk of reinfection than people under the age of 65. And so that's the kind of thing you can only see if you have very large numbers of people that you can look at the data for. And so that's really where we are now with our understanding of protection generated by having been infected with COVID-19. The nuance to that is that actually people who have been infected with COVID-19, their immune memory is very heterogeneous. There are a lot of differences from person to person. And so we noted that, other studies have noted that, where if you look at the data in our paper, whether you look at the antibody measured or the B-sounds or the different kinds of T-sounds, there's about a hundredfold range between any two people at sort of opposite ends of the scale. That's a big difference, right? So we can say, yes, overall, the vast majority of people have measurable memory and it looks like decent memory. But if you look at specific individuals, there are big differences and a hundredfold differences. And as I said, we don't know what exactly is needed to protect against this virus, but certainly a hundredfold differences big, right? If you were playing a basketball game, right? And one team scored one point and the other team scored a hundred points. That's not very close. And you would say there is a difference there that you should pay attention to. Immunology is not a basketball game, but still, right? That's a large difference and we don't know how to interpret those details. And so in fact, we said, you know, probably it's plausible that people at the low end of that are more susceptible to reinfections because it looks like they might have a lot less immunity than some other people. And unfortunately, there's no simple way to predict which person is which. So we can say at a population level, yeah, most people have measurable immune memory. But some people, something like five percent of people are really at the low end. So are those people at greatest risk? And so that's where the immunology is. If you put on your hat as an individual or if you put on your hat as a public health professional, you're going to view those data in some different ways, right? So at an individual level, one of the spectrum would be on myself uncomfortable getting infected. I don't mind if I get infected. I don't mind if I get sick. But I don't want to end up in the hospital. That would be maybe one of the spectrum level person's level of comfort, you know, how protected can I expect that I am having already had COVID-19. It's quite rare for somebody who has previously had COVID-19 to end up hospitalized. The numbers are so low, we can't even get good numbers still at this point. I think it's, is, is what I do is. But that you'd probably want to warn the person, you know, that the look, even a non hospitalized infection can be pretty serious, right? A long COVID issues have been present in people who don't get hospitalized. And I'd say another end of the spectrum would be somebody saying, no, I don't, I don't, I don't want to get sick at all, either because of the age category they're in, right, or underlying conditions, or just that they don't want to get infected and be passing it on to other people, right? Whether or not they themselves would be healthy, they don't want to risk. They're, they're parent or grandparent or neighbor, right, getting infected by them. So they really want, don't want to change their behavior unless they have a very high level of protection. Would people who have previously had COVID-19 get infected enough to transmit to other people? They're just haven't been studies that would, that would measure that. And so continuing to wear a mask and do social distancing is, is very much what you would recommend to that one, that one person. But of course, the United States has 350 million people so you can't go and make 350 million individual recommendations, right? So if you put on your public health hat, what's, what's the recommendation? That, that you give. And it's like given that there is such heterogeneity from person to person who's had COVID-19, some of them have a lot of immunity and some don't have much immunity. And so some of them, there's definitely data that some of them can get infected again. And, you know, again, almost all of them are asymptomatic, but can get infected again. And can some of those people transmit? We are there's, there's at least some concern of that. So, so that's why the public health recommendations have generally been. People have had COVID, should continue to behave as if they haven't, as well as they should get the vaccine. And maybe we wouldn't come back to the vaccine after we talk about that vaccine in general. I will also say obviously public health official of which I am not, right? I'm a scientist, I'm an immunologist, I measure the immunospots as the vaccines and interpret them. But if you are a public health official, you also have to deal with the realities of implementing a policy, right? And one of the problems with policies surrounding people who have had COVID-19 is that there's no stamp, you know, that says, that says, I've had COVID-19 and you haven't, right? There's no consistent definition of that. Question that a lot of people have at this point is if I've already had COVID-19 and there's data that shows that I have likely strong immunity for six to eight months to it, why would we waste a precious vaccine dose? There's a limited supply at this time on someone who's had infection. And we spread those vaccines around people that haven't had COVID-19 and then maybe consider coming back later to the people who have had COVID-19 and get them vaccinated at a later time. Yeah, what do you think about those questions that people have? Yeah, those are great questions. The quick answer is most people who have had COVID-19 have immunity for a significant period of time, but there's a lot of variation between people and that's that hundredfold range I was talking about, right? Because of that, some of those people don't have much immunity. And so that's sort of point number one and then point number two is if you take a look at the vaccines, the vaccines are eliciting even more immunity than natural infection. Okay. You put those two things together, those two pieces of immunological data as well as the protective immunity data, that's generally led to this public health recommendation of you should still get vaccinated. We can go into the details of that. And a backdrop to some of that is the argument that natural immunity is always better, right? Than vaccines. So let's go with natural immunity. And that's incorrect. There are definitely a range of infections for which natural immunity isn't very good. In vaccines can do better. Papaloma virus is the most dramatic example where people really don't develop immunity to HPV, which can lead to that virus causing fatal cancers in people. And instead the vaccine gives like 99.9 percent protective immunity very quickly. There's a night and day difference between the natural immunity and the vaccine with the vaccine being dramatically better. And in fact, the reference point for this novel coronavirus was, well, wait, do people develop immunity at all and do people develop immune memory at all, right? And that's the way we approach the problem when we were measuring immune memory in people. From that context, we say, actually people make a substantial amount of immune memory. There's definitely a real response there. It wasn't, it's not a fantastic response, okay? It's not people who have had COVID-19 don't have an amazing immune response to the virus. It's not super high neutralizing antibodies. It's not super high of anything, but it's decent. And also that this virus doesn't generally, it's not that hard of a virus to stop, right? So for some things, you just, you have to have a huge amount of immunity, a huge amount of antibody and T-cells to be able to stop a virus. This virus generally doesn't take that much to stop. And so in that context, people who have had COVID-19 have a decent amount of immunity. I think it's the way that we would really, we would really phrase that. And I think that's what we, the way we phrased it at the time. And I think thankfully, that's been enough immunity, right? To provide a significant amount of protection to those people for a substantial period of time. But, you know, compare that to the vaccines. And both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine elicit higher neutralizing antibody titers than the natural infection. And they elicit decent T-cell responses. And they know of a vaccine elicit far higher neutralizing antibody titers than the natural immunity normally does. And then several of the other vaccines fit in that mix as well. And then what you combine with that is this variability issue, right? Then I mentioned that with natural infection, you've got people with this hundred-fold range between people of different immune responses. And you don't know who's low and who's high. Really one of the wonderful things about vaccines is everybody gets the same dose of vaccine, right? And people tend to make quite a consistent immune response to the vaccine. And so we know from the early clinical trial data and from the information coming from the phase three clinical trials that people who get these vaccines, everybody's making an antibody response and a consistent antibody response, right? And so that's where you want to be. And you know that everybody's in the same range of protective immunity and you're basically not leaving people behind. And so from a public health perspective, it's both the magnitude of that immunity that the vaccines get and the consistency of immunity that the vaccines get. The leads to the recommendation that even if you've had COVID before, you should still get vaccinated so that we know that, again, if it was sort of a red, a green yellow red, you know, range, they go, okay, everybody who gets vaccinated is in the green range. But some of the people who have had COVID-19 are in the yellow or red range. And so we want to bring everybody up to be in that green range. That's the public health perspective is looking at people as a population, right? The whole group of people and trying to make sure that nobody's left behind. Well shouldn't you still kind of vaccinate everybody out first? You know, if you do a risk stratification of everybody in the United States, shouldn't the people who have had COVID-19 before, shouldn't they be at the back of the line? And that's a totally reasonable argument for that. And if that was public health policy, I would have no qualms with that decision. I think that largely comes into the problem of being realistic, right, about what you can implement and what you can't. And so it goes back to that initial topic of, well, how do you define who's had COVID and who hasn't, what sort of documentation do you require or not? And does asymptomatic count, right? And so instead of getting into all the complexity of that, the decision has been to treat them like everybody else, which is a reasonable decision, I think. I think a lot of the places that have done pretty well with their vaccine roll outs have been to be relatively inclusive about their definition of who should get vaccinated so that you're just making sure that you're vaccinating people as quickly as possible. You know, that you're not putting it from a public health perspective. You're not putting too many barriers between people getting that appointment and showing up. So you've had COVID before, when should you get vaccinated? How many doses should you get? And that remains an active topic of conversation. Scientifically, there are, I think, five studies out now specifically looking at vaccinating people who have had COVID before. And with, after one dose of an RNA vaccine, Pfizer or Moderna, people have had COVID before make a fantastic immune response. Their antibody titers are way, way, way above everybody else's. And their T cell responses jump a lot as well. And so actually, if I had COVID-19 before, I would definitely be going to get the vaccine because that's probably a level of immunity that's going to be really good for quite a while. I mean, it's literally like 50 times higher antibody levels than other people. And it also looks like those antibodies work against variants better than otherwise, which we can come back to as well. So it looks like there's very good reason for people to get at least one dose of vaccine. And exactly when to get it is, I think, something to talk to your own doctor about, because I think there are variables there, depending on your age and your underlying conditions and how serious was your first infection and how long has it been since your first infection. The simple recommendation that's being made is to get vaccinated three months after you've had COVID-19. So you mentioned that if you've had COVID-19 and you get at least one dose of the vaccine, that it's almost like getting a super booster in a way that your protective antibody levels really jump high, T cell levels jump. And I want to show a chart that you sketched and posted to your Twitter account. I'm a very visual person, so it helped me conceptualize how these variants can change the game to some degree with what we know about protective immunity. This chart shows a certain level of protective antibodies and immunity and how it just naturally declines over time. A couple things. If you could kind of explain this chart and what it is. And then secondly, you mentioned getting one dose of a vaccine if you've already had COVID-19. Do we have any data about two doses boosting those levels even further? And what's your recommendation there? Scientifically, between the several studies that are out, it doesn't look like there's a big difference between the one dose and the two dose for people who have already had COVID-19. And some of those individuals have reported larger side effects after the one dose, which is probably related to the fact that they're just making a really big immune response. And so that's where some of the discussion is, okay, the current recommendation is that people still get the two doses and people are discussing or there have been comments in some of these scientific papers that perhaps one dose would make more sense since people are already after one dose they make such a big immune response and they are having a side of extra that, you know, just fever and feeling really lousy for a day or two that one dose could suffice. And I'd say right now there's differences of opinions there, essentially that you'd really have to do a clinical trial to directly show that, to actually change the public health recommendation. So that's where the information is, like a lot of information we have, it's partial and it can point a couple of different directions depending on your comfort levels. So the variants do have a lot of implications for thinking about immunity and protection and going back to these big picture questions that we asked at the beginning of saying, well, I've had COVID-19 on a mutant now, right? Or well, I've been vaccinated on a mutant now, right? Why don't I just totally change my behavior? And one of Tony Fauci's primary comments there was, well, variants, we have to worry about variants. What study can you point to that shows again, reinfection? There are no studies that show that we can give a question. Let me finish the response to your question, if you please. The other thing is that when you talk about reinfection and you don't keep in the concept of variants, that's an entirely different ball game. That's a good reason for a mask. In the South African study conducted by J and J, they found that people who were infected with wild type and were exposed to the variant in South Africa, the 351, it was as if they had never been infected before. They had no protection. So when you talk about reinfection, you've got to make sure you're talking about wild type. I agree with you that you very likely would have protection from wild type for at least six months if you're infected. But we in our country now have variants. And I think that's right. And a lot of us are thinking along the same lines, which is for a lot of variants, there's no problem at all. You look at the laboratory measurements of immunity or you look at the way the variants are behaving in a population to get the real world data. And a lot of the variants aren't a concern. The vaccines are going to work fine against those. But there are several variants that have come along that are of concern. And I tend to put them in two categories. One is the UK variant, the B117. And then the variant first identified in South Africa, B1351, or variants similar to that immunologically, because they do kind of fall into those two different bins. So the UK variant, the quick answer is the RNA vaccines work completely fine against that variant. And the expectation is speaking specifically to the US population, the expectation is the J&J vaccine will be fine against that variant. And we know that no vaccine is good against that variant because it got tested in the UK. And so that variant is a concern because it spreads so much better than the original virus. It looks like it probably replicates faster and replicates more in your upper respiratory track. And it transmits a lot more efficiently to other people than the original virus. And so that's a problem. Because you want to talk about surges. When that variant started spreading in the UK, it was an incredible surge. And then it got going in Ireland and it was an incredible surge. And in several other countries, that's occurred. It spreads like wildfire. So it's a much tougher virus to stop. And obviously, simply by having more cases, you then have more deaths. It is a virus that is at least as virulent as the original virus. So by having more cases, you do have more hospitalizations and deaths. Again, we know from both lab experiments and the real world data that the vaccines work against that variant at preventing disease and at preventing most cases. And so also having a very real impact on transmissions. And so in the US, that variant is the immediate concern to a lot of us because it's proven that it can spread like wildfire through a population. And it's definitely in the US and it's been increasing in frequency in many states in the US. And so a lot of what's been going on between January and now has been a race between how many people can you vaccinate and how fast is that UK variant spreading in the US and then the changing of the seasons and trying to give people to follow the public health recommendations of wearing masks and having social distancing to reduce the spread. If you have a virus like that that is more transmissible, it becomes, you know, becomes all the more important to wear masks to minimize the amount of that virus that gets spread. And that's also pretty specifically the virus that's led to the recommendations about double masking to say, well, yeah, that virus is so much more transmissible. It really is hard to stop in a population. What are the public health measures you can do? And really wearing a mask is one of the simplest ones wearing masks. It is very effective and it's preventing transmission, particularly keeping, like if you are infected right, keeping it from spreading to other people. And again, that particular variant, it's very good. It's spreading. That's it's super power. If you want, you know, that's what you really have to worry about. Longer term, a lot of us are worried about the other variants more, the South Africa variant and one similar to it because immunologically, those variants are definitely escaping immunity to some measurable degree and how much they're escaping immunity depends on the study, it depends on what you're looking at. But to look specifically at vaccines, the clearest data was that with the AstraZeneca ad novaryle vaccine, that vaccine worked really well in the UK. It's stopping the regular strain of this novel coronavirus. Somewhere between 75 percent and 85 percent efficacy. It also worked in South Africa. But then as this new variant emerged in South Africa, the South Africa variant, it actually emerged in the same window of time that the vaccine trial was going on for the AstraZeneca vaccine. And so they could look at how protective the vaccine was against the main strain and against this variant. And it essentially lost, it didn't protect against cases. So it's possible it's still protecting against severe disease. But the basic measurement of stopping cases of COVID, it no longer worked. And when really quite good labs in South Africa measured the neutralizing antibody responses, they saw that the vaccine elicited good neutralizing antibodies against the original strain, but a very poor neutralizing antibodies against the variant, against the South Africa variant. And so that's what's really set off a lot of alarm bells. So some people have taken the perspective of saying, isn't it all about hospitalizations and deaths? We really want to prevent those things from happening. And then, well, and then everything can go back to normal, right? It's one perspective people, some people have. And it's absolutely true that the top level concern for vaccine success is preventing deaths in hospitalization. It's hard to get those numbers because it takes really big trials to get those numbers. But additionally, it's important to wear onto that transmission. Most of these vaccines are doing a fantastic job, not only at preventing hospitalizations and deaths, right? But also just preventing cases period, right? And preventing even asymptomatic cases. So those vaccines against the regal strain are going to be doing a great job at preventing total cases and preventing transmission. So they're going to reduce the spread of the virus in the community. And that's what you really want, right? To try and shut down the pandemic or the spread in individuals states. And we know the vaccines against the virus can be good enough to do that. And so it looks like that's not a current, at least for that vaccine and that variant, right? The AstraZeneca vaccine against the South Africa variant. It's not doing that anymore. And so it's, so then what do you do about that? We don't know for sure how the RNA vaccines are doing against that variant. There are reasons to think that the modern Pfizer vaccines will do better against that variant than the AstraZeneca. But there's no data, right? There's no real world data to show that. And so as a result, then you really have to behave with caution in that scenario, right? Which is that, okay, we know that that variant, the South Africa variant, is in the United States now. And we know that it's worrisome for immunity because again, with the AstraZeneca vaccine and in South Africa, immunity was completely lost against getting infected at all and it presumably transmission. So then what you really want to do is do your best to minimize the spread of that variant, right? At the moment, there are very few people in the US who have that variant where you want to keep it that way as much as possible, right, while finding out along the way how do other vaccines do against that variant. And essentially your worst case scenario that you need to be preparing for is that you have to have the same experience as well, several of the other vaccines will have the same experience as the AstraZeneca vaccine and have a loss of efficacy. And so then you need an updated vaccine to be able to protect against that variant. Okay, so if you're running that hypothetical scenario, that means you have to buy yourself time, right, for that vaccine to be developed. And we know that the South Africa variant is in the US right now. So yeah, it very much makes sense to recommend that even if people have been vaccinated with Pfizer of a DERN of vaccines, we don't know how well they protect against that variant or prevent transmission of it. So yes, please continue to wear masks and continue to have public health measures so that we don't have a surge or explosion of these more problematic variants. The somewhat flip side of that is to say, okay, the Jane J vaccine, the one dose Jane J, I know vaccine was tested in the US, the UK, and in South Africa. And between the US and South Africa, it only had a drop in efficacy of 72 percent to 64 percent for cases. That's actually a very small drop. So that vaccine seems to be doing pretty well against the South Africa variant. So it's not that there's something impossible about that variant, okay. Your immune system can recognize it. You can get protective immunity against it. And so that's a good sign. We have data that that happens. And in fact, the Novavax vaccine was tested in the UK and in South Africa. And it still had 60 percent efficacy in South Africa. So that's a second vaccine that has at least some efficacy against that virus. But we don't know how well they do against spread. And as I said, we know the vaccines can be really good against novel coronavirus. And so that's the bar to try and reach for, to try and save as many lives as possible, right? And keep us remaining up on a merry go round as well of variants. And one of the other things people pointed out, right, is obviously the fewer the cases you have, variants occur essentially stochastically because of the number of cases. So the fewer cases you have, the less likely it is that some new variant can come up that is even more problematic. And so we'd all love for this to be over as quickly as possible and get back to normal as quickly as possible. And yeah, the best chance for that to happen is to minimize, is to keep minimizing spread and certainly minimize spread of the variants we know about to give the vaccines the best chance to control them. Yeah, the scenario that I sketched that I said, think of this as written in crayon because we really don't have as much data as we would like, is that antibodies are really good at preventing infections. So if you have a high level of neutralizing antibodies, you can probably stop the infection from ever starting in your nose, right? So the virus infection, your nose, your upper respiratory tract. But if the antibodies don't recognize the variant anymore or recognize it quite poorly, you still get infected as a simple model. Okay, so now that you're infected, now what happens? Are there other things your immune system can do to stop this virus? And I think it's really helpful to think of this viral infection as occurring in two stages and one's the replication in the nose and the nasal passages. And then the other is the pneumonia, the replication in your lungs and it's really that replication in your lungs, that's the big worry and that's the big health problem. It's that pneumonia that can lead to right serious breathing problems and the requirement for hospitalization. And one of the things about this particular virus is that it replicates really fast in your nose. And that's been one of the big problems with this virus in terms of controlling it is that there's a lot of pre-syptomatic spread, right? People are transmitting it to other people before they even know they're infected. Well, they don't know they're infected because they're not showing any symptoms, right? And that's happening because the virus is replicating so fast in people and so secretly it's hiding from the immune system well enough that there are no symptoms. So it's very hard to stop that replication in your nasal passage because it does happen very quickly and can result in spread quite quickly, like say within four days in the infection. But the serious part of the disease in lungs happens much more slowly. And in fact the median time to death is probably something like 25 days post infection, right? That's a long time. And so there's even one day there's a lot of time for the immune system to make a response. So there's actually a lot of time for your immune system, even if your immune system can't control the virus in your nose quickly. It still has a lot of chances to control the virus, prevent the virus from getting into your lungs or controlling it pretty quickly in the lungs. So you have a mild case or you're in a but a non-hospitalized case of the disease. And so even if you don't have enough antibodies to stop the infection, do you still have enough T cells and memory B cells and antibodies to still respond within a few days and control the infection? I think the data indicate yes, that's probably happening. And it's probably a good explanation for why some vaccines work even if the antibodies aren't very good anymore. But we do still really need data on that, which is why it's in crayon. So that's talking about the vaccine. If you shift from that to people who have natural immunity, it's a similar story. It depends on what neutralizing antibody assay you look at and what date you look at. But if you look at the data from the labs in South Africa, which is where they could really see comparisons of sort of biological relevance, right? They could see, well, these people are getting infected or not getting infected. A substantial fraction of people who have had COVID have neutralizing antibodies that really fail to recognize the South Africa variant. If you start from a perspective of saying, OK, I've had COVID, I have natural immunity, I have nothing to worry about anymore, right? And well, the lesson from South Africa has been no. At least for that variant, there is reason for concern that there's a decent chance that your antibodies aren't good enough to stop that variant. And I do think it's an interesting thing to talk about, to raise the issue of incentivizing people to get vaccines. You want to get rid of vaccine hesitancy? Tell them they're wearing their mask after they get the vaccine. You want people to get the vaccine? Give them a reward, instead of telling them that the nanny state's going to be there for three more years and you got to wear a mask forever. People don't want to hear it. And most anything you do in life, right? Your best outcomes are if you can get an alignment of incentives, right? The incentive to do something and the outcome you want are aligned and are pointing in the same direction. So for vaccines, you know, as you're trying to communicate and get as many people as possible to get vaccinated because the more people were vaccinated, right, the more protected the US population is as a whole. So that's definitely a huge priority. And getting vaccination rates up to now, you know, 3 million people a day is fantastic and it's still going up. Those are really good things. But to keep those occurring, right, you have to keep getting more people getting vaccinated. And so I do think public health officials are taking that into account. And I think that I think you can hear that in the CDC recommendations in the past couple of weeks, right, of coming out with a specific recommendation that yes, if you've been vaccinated you can gather in small groups with other unvaccinated people with other people and have your have your mask off, right? And so if you've got one pair of grandparents and another pair of grandparents and they're both vaccinated, they can they can totally hang out and have meals together now and some things like that. And I think you'll you'll keep seeing progressions of that as as more data are available. I do think that there are significant pieces of data now that public health officials worry about transmission, right? As we've talked about some that you really want to knock down as many cases as possible. Well, if somebody doesn't get infected at all, they're not going to transmit. And so if the data that are coming out about a number of these vaccines, at least against the main coronavirus strain is that they're very good at preventing even asymptomatic infections, right? So when they're in the 80 percent range for that and so that's a very good sign for reduction of transmission, which I think feeds into the CDC recommendations and other recommendations. So you mentioned earlier how our situation right now in some ways is a race between how many people can we get vaccinated and how many people have immunity versus how much time does the SARS-CoV-2 virus have to replicate to to infect more people and potentially mutate into variants that can potentially escape immunity, whether it's from a vaccine or from a natural infection. So one of the viruses, of course, that we're all very familiar with and to some degree for better or for worse, comfortable with is influenza. And we are aware that we can potentially get influenza every year. And that's one of the things that I thought a lot about. Is this going to be a like and influenza scenario with this novel coronavirus? So from your perspective as a virologist and immunologist, how likely is that? Obviously it's influenza, it's a completely different family of viruses. One of viruses are different. So when you look at these two viruses, what comes to mind for you as you look ahead to the future? A simple answer is if you really get the case numbers way down and there are very few people infected and you get lots of people vaccinated, there are very few opportunities for a variance to show up until it becomes less of an issue. The more direct answer is we don't know. There's definitely a wide range of opinions right now amongst a monologist and immunologist about where the future of this pandemic lies. I'd say definitely one, the spectrum is people with perspective that this will become like another influenza virus and there will be new variants every year too and annual vaccinations will be the norm to try and deal with the variants. I'd say essentially the opposite end of the spectrum would be SARS-CoV-2 variants do exist, but the fact that there's actually been a lot of convergent evolution between the variants in different parts of the world on variants coming up with the same mutations may indicate that there aren't actually many mutations that the virus can do that escape immune responses. Which may indicate that you need one more vaccine improvement, for example, a vaccine that's a booster immunization that's really to the South Africa variant because a lot of the other variants of concern look fairly similar to that variant immunologically. So, using that one as a stereotypic variant that's escaped a significant amount of antibody responses. You may need one more booster vaccine against that and then after that the virus may be mostly out of tricks, they may have basically played its best cards. I do think I lean more towards that second end of the spectrum. I do think in looking at the human antibody response and the human T cell response to this virus, they're both pretty broad responses. So, if it was a really narrow response, it's much easier for a virus to escape a narrow response than a broad response. So, the breadth of the response is a good sign plus data that people who have been infected with the South Africa variant are actually making very good antibodies both against the South Africa variant and the parental strain. Again, suggesting that there's basically there's not something magic about that variant. It's not the immune system. Can't see that variant. It just hadn't before. And in fact, there's data that people have had regular who have natural immunity to COVID-19 and who give one dose of RNA vaccine actually make really good antibody responses to the South Africa variant, even though they've never seen the South Africa variant, which is consistent with the immune system being pretty sophisticated about making antibodies that can recognize a virus in multiple different ways. So even if one solution doesn't work, it's got multiple other solutions at the same time, as well as those people, as I mentioned before, those people getting a big bump overall in their immune response. So, whether having natural immunity or vaccination generates a decent amount of immunity, but then a booster vaccine looks like it's likely to generate, well, a booster vaccine on top of natural immunity definitely generates a big bump in overall immunity. And that will probably also occur when people get booster doses after vaccination, though we don't have the data for that now. So from an immunological perspective, I think there's a decent chance that we have to do with one big round here of variants and then it becomes less of a problem in the future. Maybe the virus has one additional escape that requires one additional round of coming up with a better booster vaccine. And I think the virology largely supports that as well, that the viral evolution experts look at the mutation rates of this virus and people like Jesse Bloom will have looked at mutation rates of common cold coronal viruses and how they've interacted with human antibody responses over time, suggest a relatively slow evolution of that virus, which I think is consistent with. If you've got a good vaccine, it's likely to be able to protect. Professor Crowdy, thank you as always for your time and clarification of these important questions. And just to wrap things up, I know you and your team there at the Crowdy Lab at Lilhaia Institute of Immunology are always busy and continues to look at these questions. So what are you and your team looking at now and are you working on any other publications at the moment? Yeah, so one of the questions about variants has been, even if the antibodies don't work in T cells, provide some protection or do the variants escape T cells. And so Alex Eddie's lab upstairs is leading really great efforts on that and we're helping out with that. And then continuing to ask and answer questions about immune memory after getting vaccinated or after getting infection, how long do those last? The immune system is complicated to their lot of parts of that memory to measure and track over time and how does that relate to variants. And then trying to get answers about these questions in particular populations of interest, like people over the age of 65 or people who may be struggled to make good immune responses normally. Obviously these are, you want to have good answers for populations at risk. So things like that are high on our list as well as doing our day jobs of the not COVID research at the same time. Well we look forward to seeing those publications when they come out and speaking with you again in the future, really appreciate your time today. Thanks Kyle, great stuff, thanks for having me."
"Children and COVID-19 with Daniel Griffin (Long COVID, Vaccines, School Safety)",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-03-19,QKZTvDv_vwI,"Well, I'm excited to be here with Dr. Daniel Griffin, instructor in clinical medicine and associate research scientist at Columbia University. Dr. Griffin is board certified in infectious disease and co-host of the popular podcast this week in virology. And Dr. Griffin, your perspective during this pandemic has been so valuable because you've combined the body of research about COVID-19, including your own published research and a clinical perspective. What are physicians like yourself and other medical professionals actually experiencing on the ground? And you've been saying for months now that there are a lot of misconceptions about COVID-19 infection in children and that this is something that we should take very seriously. So you are an ideal expert to help clear up these misconceptions and also give an update on the vaccine outlook for children. In addition to some practical tips that parents or other people around children can use. But I want to start with a very simple question. Are kids less likely to get and transmit COVID-19 as compared to adults? Well, thank you, Kyle, for giving this opportunity to speak about kids in COVID. I think we all care about this important issue. And I will start off by saying that is clearly now a myth that children don't get COVID, that children can't spread COVID. And we all suspected this early on. And this is one of, I'll say, of the nice perspectives that I can often bring because I'm on the ground. I'm not just reading the literature and then digesting it and spitting it back out. I'm actually working directly with patients in my position where I get to talk to a lot of other clinicians. I get to see what's going on not just in my experience, but in our experience. And I've also worked with a lot of schools and camps and programs because hey, we all have kids, we all care about kids, maybe some of us once work kids. And I like in this first scenario, we saw the initial reports out of China, hey, kids are not getting COVID. But then you have to look a little deeper. And I like in the analogy, like, hey, on a rainy day when I keep my kids inside the house, they don't get wet. That's what we were doing early on in COVID. We were keeping the kids home. We're keeping them in the house. And yes, you don't get COVID if you're not going to the supermarket. If you're not going to work, if you're not going to the schools or these other areas. And I'll get into the risk factors in those other areas. But no, you put a child in the same proximity to someone with COVID. Kids get COVID. Kids spread COVID. Our kids turning up positive on the acute tests for COVID-19 as compared to adults. And if so, why might that be the case? Yeah. So children definitely can test positive for COVID. But there are a few differences. One of the things you probably noticed is if you've ever seen a child being tested, we tend to be a little gentler with the kids. Even early on when we were doing the brain biopsy routinely, these beautiful tests as they were described. With kids, we often were just sampling the anterior areas. Maybe we're getting quite as good as sample. And also there's a bias to not wanting to test kids, right? If mom and dad both have COVID, they test positive. Johnny's coughing, sneezing, not feeling well, we presume COVID. So a lot of times you'll end up with these biases. But no, kids, kids test positive, just like adults, if you get a good sample. But there might be a little difference where we're learning that children may not shed the virus as long. So there may be a shorter period, a shorter window that you can catch them having that positive PCR test. We know that any testing strategy for acute infection is not going to pick up every infection. What do we know at this time about the prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population and specifically with kids? Yeah, so one of the ways that we look back and say, oh, how many people have been infected over time is to do these serology, these antibody tests. And I think what we've realized is, wow, we probably missed half or the majority of the infections. You know, not necessarily missed them so much as the people did not go in, they did not get tested, it did not get confirmed. And more people are testing on these blood tests of having had COVID than we initially identified. We're seeing that for parents. We're also seeing for children. But one of the things, and there's two challenges here, one of them is people with mild cases. Sometimes we'll have negative blood tests, negative serology tests. And so that's particularly a challenge for us with children because it is true that in general, children have more asymptomatic, more mild cases than adults. Some recent data that was just put forth by the CDC, it looks like actually maybe 90 percent of the cases in children were missed. When they looked at the numbers reported less than 10,000 cases reported in children, when they did the blood tests, it looks like maybe over 100,000 cases in children. And as I mentioned, that's probably an underestimation as well because not every child infected with COVID ends up with that positive blood test. So we actually think that in areas where children have been out and about, where parents and adults have been out and about, that we have a much higher number of infections than we initially realized. At this point, we've all heard that severe complications from COVID are less likely in children than adults. But can you put some context on this? Is it like one in a million children that get infected with COVID-19 have a severe complication? Or is it more common than that? And are any particular groups of children more at risk for severe complication from COVID-19? I think it's really important to put in perspective what we say about COVID in children, as far as severity, as far as the risks. So I'm going to break it down into, say, three categories. So the first is, what's the risk that a child gets exposed, gets infected with COVID, and ends up in the hospital? And I'm going to say that is much less common than we see in adults. We early on, we're seeing about 10 to 20 percent of the adults ending up in the hospital. But there's really a curve here. If you're in your 80s, okay, maybe 30 percent. You get down to about 65, it starts dropping. You actually get down into children, say, 18 and under. Here you're talking about well less than 1 percent. We're talking about maybe a percent of 1 percent end up in the hospital. So it is, it is a low likelihood that a child will end up in the hospital. We've probably all heard about the multi inflammatory disease that we see in children. We're talking about thousands of cases in our entire country. So this is again, this is a low risk. We have seen deaths in children, but a lot less. We're looking at half a million deaths in adults. We're looking at thousands of deaths in children. So much smaller, just looking at our country. The one thing I do want to bring up, and I think this is what parents are getting quite upset about now, is children like adults may get COVID and then not be better in just a week or two, the long COVID that we've been hearing more and more about in adults. In adults, we say that's about 20 percent. Now in children, it may be as high as 10 percent, at least what we're hearing in the UK where they have really good surveillance. Here in the US, we're starting to see this more and more on the ground as children are trying to return to sports as children are trying to do their virtual school. Kids are going out to play soccer and they're realizing, I can't run up and down a soccer field. What's going on? I had COVID a couple of months ago and I thought I was fine or the teacher calling and saying, hey, your son is not paying attention to the school. What's happening? And the parent relating that, okay, a couple months ago, my son had COVID, but it was mild, but this long COVID. So I think that's really important when we think about children. We say, oh, don't worry, it's going to be mild. They're not going to die. They're not going to end up in the hospital. But they may have trouble doing sports. They may have trouble in school. So I think that's one of the components of COVID in children that we can't lose sight of. With this long hauler syndrome or post-acute COVID syndrome, long COVID goes by many different names. I know you've been a big advocate for these patients during the pandemic and you've seen a lot of these patients and spoken with colleagues about them. As a parent, with a child that's watching this, what symptoms should they be looking for? Because as you've mentioned, many children that have had acute COVID, they may not have had remarkable symptoms. But we're finding out now it's for my understanding possible that they could go on to have long-term symptoms from COVID. What tips can you give parents to kind of clue them into what to look for? Yeah, I mean, the first thing is don't let your child get COVID, right? You can't develop long COVID. You can't have a post-COVID complication if you never had COVID. There are certain things about the presentation that make it more or less likely. But what I think the most frightening things we have now realized is about a third of our long COVID patients had an asymptomatic initial infection. And when they started having their symptoms, we did a blood test and realized, oh my gosh, you had COVID before. And then we sort of pieced together the exposure that seems to explain that. So it's hard. If your child is exposed and test positive, reassuring, I could say 90 percent, they're probably going to be okay. But now we're hearing 10 percent, maybe not. So we don't see long COVID just in people end up in the hospital. We don't see long COVID just in people that have severe disease. We sometimes see long COVID in adults and children who've been infected and maybe even had an asymptomatic first episode. You mentioned the potential symptom of not returning to sports as well. There's sports performance diminishing, maybe cognitive performance diminishing in the classroom. Any other specific symptoms that you're seeing, I'm hearing that it can be all different types of symptoms with long COVID. But are kids experiencing the loss of taste and smell that adults are chronically in some cases? Yeah, so it really seems to be very similar. I actually do calls on a regular basis with our pediatrician just to get a really big overview of what are we all seeing, right, to get larger numbers? And children end up with the same. It could be headaches. It's actually quite common in kids. It could be loss of taste and smell. It could be hair loss. Actually, I have to say a few of those cases have been really traumatic. You can imagine an adolescent and their hair starts falling out and not growing in. It could be challenges. This brain fog as we see in adults. We see that in kids also having trouble concentrating in school. But really big stuff is the fatigue, the low energy. You know, it's hard enough to get my teenagers out of the bed every morning. And I can imagine like if that was magnified to any degree. So really think about what we hear long COVID in adults. We're seeing that spectrum in our kids as well. I mean, one of the things that I think is a challenge, more of a challenge for my pediatric colleagues is that a lot of times COVID presents in a child just as a stuffy nose, just as a sneeze. We usually say, oh my gosh, the only thing COVID doesn't cause a sneeze as well. In our adolescents and children, we're seeing sneezing congestion. And what we would have thought is not typical COVID symptoms. You mentioned earlier that kids certainly have are less likely to get severe COVID as compared to adults. What are the current theories about why that may be the case? And is there anything we can learn from a child's immune system that we can apply to our own lives as adults? Yeah, I mean, one thing we've known for years is that children tend to handle first exposures to respiratory viruses, respiratory infections better than adults. You know, maybe it's their sort of getting used to what's in their world to use almost an analogy there. As we get older, our immune systems don't work quite as well. They overreact. And I think what we're seeing in a lot of the children is actually a reasonable appropriate immune response. And as we get older and there's a spectrum to this, the older you are, the more likely it is that you're going to over-respond. You're going to have all these cytokines, this whole inflammatory storm. Kids, most kids, as I'm saying, you know, they get this most of the time they clear it, most of them don't even have symptoms. And unfortunately, there is this small subset. And I think that's what raises concerns for us. The kids that seem to have something up with their immune system. For a child that's had acute COVID-19 and is active and maybe on a sports team, what type of advice would you give them and their family as far as deciding whether to return back to sports safely? Should they get a cardiac evaluation? Should they check in with their, you know, pediatrician? What should be the protocol for getting back to sports? Yeah, a lot of us actually have put protocols in place and we have protocols here in place in the tri-state area. Any children that have actually had symptomatic COVID, particularly any that have had more than a mild case, we're recommending that they're evaluated by a cardiologist prior to returning to sports. And we don't necessarily do a stress test, but it might just be an exam, it might be an EKG and then we kind of go from there. But just to be on the safe side, we're trying to make sure that we don't send these kids back out there while they have inflammation of the heart, which we've clearly seen. And then once they get out there doing the sports, then we sort of get a sense of how they had this impact on their ability to perform on the sports field. Going back to this multi-inflammatory syndrome, you mentioned in a previous interview or maybe it was on this week in biology that this potentially seems to have changed a little bit over the last several months and that it may be presenting differently now. Can you talk more about that? Yeah, so this is something originally we started hearing about communications, pediatric ER clinicians were seeing this. The first case reports were coming out of the UK and these were mostly children who did not have a recognized acute COVID infection. And then we're coming into the emergency room basically in shock with all this inflammation of their blood vessels with multi-organ effects. And then on blood testing, maybe even sometimes when you did the PCR test, you could still document that they had the infection. So this is sort of a week three, four, a later complication, something that all our evidence suggests is an immune mediated complication. Early on, it was about 50-50 whether or not these children would end up in the ICU. Over the last couple months, 80 to 90 percent of these children have ended up requiring ICU level care. So something has changed here. And they go to the ICU specifically for just respiratory complications, not hypoxemia presumably. So it could be both. It can be the respiratory complications, needing the oxygen and the respiratory support. But a lot of times these kids can't even keep their blood pressure up. It's like they're in septic shock, blood pressure is dropping. They need IV fluids. They need all kinds of medicines to keep that blood pressure up. We call pressers. These kids can be really ill and unfortunately we have lost a number of children from this syndrome. And what are the first symptoms that one should look for that could clue them into this syndrome? Yeah, I have to say this is tough. I mean a lot of times the child will become maliceless, low energy. Fever is often the breathing might start to increase. Yeah, I mean I don't want to alarm all the parents. This is fortunately not a hardly common, but we have seen thousands of cases already here clearly documented. And so this is one of the challenges because you don't have that acute COVID necessarily warning you that this is something to think about three to four weeks later. It's just out of the blue, your son, your daughter. It's just not feeling well is kind of listless. And then we realize that this is what's going on. Well, Dr. Griffin, you are a parent yourself and you're navigating this situation like the rest of us as more, more, more adults get vaccinated and schools are opening up and people are also looking ahead to summer plans and summer camps. Any tips, how are you navigating this as far as social time for your kids, activities, back to school and any practical tips you can give to other parents that are watching this? Yes, so this is the challenge. Now that our teachers, our adults are getting vaccinated, unfortunately what we're seeing right here in the New York Tri-State area is an increasing number of infections in the kids. And I think there's two perceptions here. One is the reason why a lot of children were kept home from school or kept indoors, had limited play dates and other social interactions is we were concerned that the children would get infected and then it would spread to a more vulnerable person. I'm a little concerned now that we're seeing clear evidence of the long effects of COVID in children. So I use my son Barnaby as an example. He's 15. He's in high school. He loves to run. And he is probably not going to die of COVID if he gets infected. But what impact might it have on his ability to concentrate? What if he starts developing these chronic headaches? What if he goes out for sports, which as a young boy is really critical to his sense of self and he can no longer run and compete and enjoy that activity with this friends? So this is a challenge for us because as the parents that everyone else gets vaccinated, if we go into the school openings and we go into the sports with the idea that, oh, if the kids get infected, it's fine. That's going to be a problem. We don't want 10 percent of our children having the long COVID. Even though we count the numbers of children that have died in the thousands, as opposed to the hundreds of thousands, that's a lot of children that have died. So I'm concerned going into this. But I will say we have learned over the last year we can open camps. We can open schools safely. Unfortunately, we've also learned that we can do it unsafe as well. Do you think that kids need to wear masks outside if they're playing soccer or engage in other sports outside, for example? Well, one of the things we've learned, so I'm going to say they can play soccer without masks. It's going to get me in trouble, but everything I say about kids does. That's okay. We've learned that there are different things that you can do and they increase or decrease your risk accordingly. So one of the biggest things we've learned is that if you are outside, that reduces the risk of transmission. About 20 fold. That's huge. That's orders of magnitude. We talk about a mask reducing the risk by 80 percent. That's not orders of magnitude. That's an 80 percent drop. But outside. So outdoors is great. If the kids are all hunched together in a ball on the sideline at the soccer field, that's a little bit different. So masks on when they're at the side, try to keep them a little bit distance. But when they're out there playing a soccer field, those sort of short quick interactions, that seems to me to be a very low risk activity and is reasonably low risk. I think we've got to start making reasonable low risk decisions, not looking for that 100 percent safe because it is not 100 percent safe to keep a kid locked in the basement. We've got to start figuring out what are acceptable risks. I want to shift gears to vaccines and all three of the authorized vaccines in the United States at this time have been in the news lately because they are trying to get a vaccine. So we have Pfizer, which is EUA, down to 16. We have Moderna, which is down to 18 and J&J, which is down to 18. Now the Moderna and Pfizer are a newer technology, this mRNA technology, which we have in the United States. We have Pfizer, which is EUA, down to 16. We have Moderna, which is down to 18 and J&J, which is down to 18. Now the Moderna and Pfizer are a newer technology, this mRNA technology, which we have never used in children before. Actually, we never used it in adults before, but now I can say a few months into this, we've now given it to millions of adults, pregnant women, women wanting to get pregnant, all sorts of people, women never wanting to get pregnant, men never wanting to get pregnant. So we have a growing experience in adults, but we still have not used this in children. From a scientific view, there's no reason to think that these vaccines will represent a risk to younger individuals, and they're being actively studied right now for safety and efficacy. Everyone's guessing about the timeline. The current is the under promise over deliver, so we say that, oh, these will eventually be there, but then we give you a really long time scale and then when they show up early or delighted. The J&J, actually, I'm going to talk about this platform because this platform, this technology actually has been given to kids, to children as young as four months of age. Not this specific vaccine targeting the SARS-CoV-2, that causes COVID-19, but when we were doing this in West Africa, hundreds of thousands of individuals were vaccinated to end the Ebola outbreaks using the same technology that went to pregnant women, that went to children down to four months of age. That vaccine platform, we actually have quite a bit of safety data. We are getting the safety data on this specific vaccine for J&J as well. All the studies are ongoing. They enrolled pretty quickly. Poor Barnaby, again, we tried to put him in a Moderna trial, but you had to drive to Massachusetts multiple times, which we were maybe willing to do at one point, but now we're going to get this data going forward. There's every reason to believe that these are going to be safe, effective, and available for our children. It's just a question of when. Along those lines, do you think the J&J vaccine might be the front runner for authorization among the vaccine candidates for children? I have to say, when I saw that there was an extra 100 million purchased, right, when we now have 200 million doses of J&J, this vaccine honestly makes the most sense for children. It's a one and done. It's a vaccine, which has very low reactogenicity. So most people get this vaccine. They don't have much of reaction. They don't have a fever. Really kind of an ideal thing to do with mass vaccination in schools and other venues like that. A little tougher if you think about it, giving a child one shot, then they have a fever, or maybe don't feel so great, trying to bring them back for that second one. So I have to say, from a logistical, from a reactogenicity, from a patient uptake, the J&J is really an ideal platform for vaccinating our children. Do you think the widespread vaccination of children is a key component of reaching herd immunity, not only in this country, but as a global community as well? I honestly think it is key. Looking globally, yes, just because you start looking at the numbers. In the United States, we have an older population. The percent of our population under 18 is smaller than some other parts of the world, like Africa, India, even Ireland, I think. So if you start looking at the numbers, can we get pretty close in the US without vaccinating kids? Maybe if everybody else wanted to be vaccinated, but not everyone in a society wants to be vaccinated. So to get to those numbers, I'm probably going to have to have uptake in our children as well. So in the US, I'll say yes, and the rest of the world, I'll say definitely yes. I know you can't predict the future, but what do you think the most likely outcomes are with regard to vaccines? And both adults and children, do you think it's something we'll need to get a booster every year for? Do you think SARS-CoV-2 is going to be endemic in the population? And we're going to be dealing with it like influenza? How do you see this panning out? Yeah, no, I mean, I think we're supposed to predict the future, right? It's the only thing worth predicting. The past is easy to predict. No, and I think in our training and infectious disease and global health and public health, we're supposed to be trying to get an understanding of what is likely to happen in the future. So it's not looking into a crystal ball, it's looking into the science. And there's a couple things here. The SARS-CoV-2 does not just, in fact, humans, it also infects a lot of other animals on the planet. So this is not an easy virus to think that it's ever going to go away. The other thing is we don't live in a society where 100 percent of the population is going to get vaccinated. So again, there's every reason to think that SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19, is here to stay. It's really just a question of at what level? So as we go forward, the question of at what level, the question of how durable is the immunity that we get will really dictate how often we need to get a vaccination for this. The other thing, I think this is really critical, is this is sort of ours to lose. This is a race between the vaccines and the virus. If we do a great job and we really spread the well, so to speak, and get everyone in the world vaccinated, that puts us in a great spot. The more we give this virus, the opportunity to replicate, to reproduce, to make changes to its sequence. The more we give the opportunity for vaccine-resistant variants, and that's on us. So if we just vaccinate ourselves here in the US, and then we celebrate on July 4th and forget about the rest of the world, it's just a question of on which plane flight someone brings a variant back into our country that our vaccines are not effective against. So we have some holidays approaching, including Easter, Passover, and other holidays. You've already given some practical tips for parents to help keep their kids safe from COVID-19. What about families that have decided to gather with other families, any other practical tips that you can give as holidays approach and presumably more gatherings are going to happen? Yeah, one of the things that, and I think hopefully this is helpful to add to the dialogue, is what about the kids? And a lot of people have basically this perception that, oh, the kids will be all right. They don't end up in the hospital, they don't die, but we do want to say that, hey, a percent of the children can get sick and not be well in just two weeks. They might have this long COVID in children. We don't know how long it lasts. We're learning more and more about it every day. So you don't want to just write them off. You don't want to just say, hey, you're under 18, you know, you'll be fine. Let's still make an effort to try to protect them. And how do we do that? So one of the first things is those people who can be vaccinated, that's fantastic. Not only does it protect them, but we have growing amounts of evidence suggesting that they're less likely to transmit COVID to other people. The other is gathering sizes. We're really headed in the right direction, but we're not there yet. Right now, in a lot of parts of our country, we still have pretty high prevalence. So when you get to, when you get a gathering, if you get more than a certain number of people together, you really started increasing the risk that someone's going to be there, infected, and able to infect your children. So you want to think about those decisions. Can the venue be outdoors? Can people get tested before they come? I think we've got to look at the same way we did at the prior holidays. We had a lot of transmission around the December holidays and New Year's. And we saw over 300,000 cases that next month because of that. So these holidays with the growing number of variants, with the growing complacency, definitely represent a risky time. So make these decisions, really think it through. I think we were told that, hey, July 4th is going to be a fantastic outdoor holiday, where we're going to be having barbecues and the like. So let's not sort of miss this opportunity to continue to be safe. Let's not give that virus a leg up in this next set of holidays. Would it be better for kids to get a PCR test as opposed to an antigen test, which we believe may not work quite as well in asymptomatic patients? So I think it's a complicated question, but I'm going to give you a straight answer. One of the things we've noticed about these rapid tests is they're not as sensitive when the level of the virus is low. But then again, people are not as likely to transmit. So the rapid tests are fantastic for picking up in real time, someone with high levels of infectious virus. But this certainly are going to be lots of situations where you want that higher level with the PCR. Not only can the PCR pick up low levels, but because it can pick up low levels, it can pick it up while someone is just starting to have an increase in the virus. So it might pick it up a day early. So ideal is to get the rapid test. You know right away if it's positive, but if it's negative, then we are recommending doing the PCRs. And one of the great things is we have a lot of testing capacity. Unfortunately, we're not having a lot of people doing a lot of tests, which results in another great thing is we're usually getting results back really quickly. So I think that if you're thinking about testing before the holidays, the capacity, the quick turnaround time is there. And I think we even have some new legislation saying, hey, no one should pay for these other than those big insurance companies in the government. So I think we have access to quick turnaround free testing. I guess not free. It'll probably be paid for by our taxes, but that's okay. Rather, rather pay taxes than a hospital bill. Do you think there's a role in antibody testing for parents, you know, getting their kids tested and looking at things like play cohorts, other kids that their kids can safely play with, could antibody testing be part of that strategy? So I don't think antibody testing is great. Unfortunately, we have certainly seen reinfections and we've certainly seen people with a positive antibody test go on to have a positive PCR afterwards. So I usually discourage the antibodies. And I say, you know, go ahead, keep your kids safe, do the testing for the virus. The antibody is not as reliable. I think sometimes gives people a false sense of security. Well, we've covered a lot so far. Any other angles to kids in COVID-19 that we haven't discussed yet that you want to mention? Well, I think the big hot topic now is schools are we're going to be really opening schools to full enrollment. And tied in there is this three feet versus six feet, right? It's six feet magical. It's three feet enough magic. And I'll continue to talk about this, but there's levels of safety. We know that if you wear a mask, about an 80 percent reduction in your risk. If you get the deaths out to about three feet, you're going to get another 80 percent reduction. You get to six feet a little bit more. But most of our schools cannot go back to full class with a six foot distance. So a lot of our schools are going to be looking at ways of combining different strategies. If you have upgraded ventilation systems, if the kids are wearing masks, sometimes they're even doing these plexiglass shields. They're keeping the discs the desks three feet apart because they have those physical barriers. There are ways that we now know to get our kids safely back to school. Schools have not been areas of high transmission. So this is going to be our next challenge is looking at real world examples and seeing how we can safely get our kids out of the house and back back to their peers, back to their teachers and moving forward with their lives. And along those lines, do you think it's appropriate at this time for kids to go back to in-person learning? You know, I've worked with a lot of schools giving them advice free advice, right? So it's worth whatever I get paid. So my free advice and some of our schools actually have to say one of our school districts on the South Shore has had in-person in the morning for half of the school, in-person in the afternoon for the other half. They've not had to shut. They've not had transmission. I've worked with another school in New Jersey. There are several schools that have successfully kept the kids in class. I think we now have the resources. We now have all this stimulus coming that I think a lot of schools are going to be able to safely be open. But again, I always say it's also possible to open a school in a manner that is not safe. So a lot of our ability to open the schools and get the kids in-person really comes to us. Getting those resources there, making sure we have those ventilation systems, the spacing and all the other mitigation strategies. But yeah, we are at a point where I think we're going to get schools open very soon. If they're not opening in the next few months, I think we can all look at September of next year as having our schools fully open and in-person, not hybrid models. Any other practical tips for teachers that are going back to in-person learning to help keep themselves safe? I mean, the best thing a teacher can do is get vaccinated. That really has turned out to be a really tremendous effective approach. But the other, continue with these mitigation strategies that we've talked about. You don't really want to have a mild case. So, wearing the mask is reasonable. Keeping your distance is reasonable. Also, keep you invested in the ventilation and everything else. So I think we've learned that teachers can safely do this. What are the high-risk activities for teachers? Not so much teaching the class as hanging out with your colleagues in that break room. Taking off that mask to have a cup of coffee or something to eat. So, you know, think about your decisions and we want to keep our teachers as well as our kids safe and healthy. So, make smart decisions and I think we've learned there are ways to do this safely, but there's also ways to make mistakes. For several months now, you've highlighted the different stages of a COVID-19 infection that I found really helpful. And I believe you had a publication about it as well. Can you describe that for listeners that are new to your work? That took a lot of work. I'm very proud of that work. But we did. I got together with it. It was about 35 of us from around the world. It was, you know, clinicians at the bedside, researchers, people looking through what were their personal experience, what were we learning. And we really, really realized with COVID-19 timing matters. This is not a monolithic disease. There's a first week after someone has been infected, what we call the viral replication phase. This is when they're out. This is when some of our therapies, like the monoclonal antibodies, really critical, really make a big difference. But it's not when they end up in the hospital. It's not till week two and they enter into this early inflammatory phase that we start seeing them end up in the hospital. And at this point, when we throw our antivirals, we throw our monoclonals in a sense, we've missed our window. This is when our focus is on how do we modulate this dysfunctional immune response. And then, unfortunately, some people continue to progress. They end up in the ICU. They're there, week three, they're week four. And we start realizing this is when we're starting to see the clotting complications. This is when we're starting to see the secondary infections. This is where those kids who were fine initially come in with this late multi-system inflammatory process. And then, even after you've made it through then, there's a post-infection risk of clotting, this post-infection hyper-quagible phase. And then, for some individuals, as we discussed today, it doesn't even end there. There's a tail for months, continued fevers, for months, continued fatigue and impacts on their life. There's a stage when the hair starts falling out, other things like that. So, you know, that was a bunch of us getting together. What are we seeing? Let's come up with common terminology because if you try a therapy at the wrong time, it's not going to work. That doesn't mean the therapy doesn't work. It just means your timing was off. So, until I think we really laid this out and really understood the stage of the disease, it was really hard to design our trials. Also, hard to know when you should give which therapy. And have you seen those stages that you and your team identified? Have they been adopted internationally pretty well? They seem to be, and if you look at the treatment wrecks, they're sort of falling right into these categories, right? You know, the monoclonals that we talk about, they want to be in the first seven to ten days. Once you see signs of that early inflammatory phase require for oxygen, then you're moving into the dexamethasone stage. That's when you're moving into the anticoagulants and the hospital admissions. So, I think this framework has been adopted and is really being used in a lot of the trial designs now. Is there any current research that you're working on? So, actually, the big thing now, I guess I'm shifting into the long COVID, but I'm also working, continuing to work a lot on the monoclonal. So, I mentioned earlier today, I was on a call, we're shifting over to cocktails in a lot of our sites. Actually, all our sites across the country as we're seeing changes in the virus sequence. And we're trying to look at a couple, I think, interesting questions. One is not only how well do people do with the monoclonals, but does it prevent long COVID? So, maybe this isn't just a therapy to keep people out of the hospital, maybe this is a therapy to protect people from that disability. So, large, large study ongoing looking at that. But then we're also following, we got funding to follow up to 10,000 people who've had COVID to see how they do over time. We want to see, you know, what percent of them continue to have symptoms. We want to see what happens with those antibodies after natural infection as well as vaccination. We also want to see this sort of exciting new development, what's the impact of vaccination on long COVID? We started seeing some interesting observations that maybe 30, 40 percent of people with long COVID get a vaccine and get better. So, we're studying, trying to get a real solid number on that and also trying to understand are there particular vaccines that have that impact? And then what's the mechanism? What's going on there? So, hopefully a lot of more exciting information to be coming in the future. That's, I got to ask you more about the patients with long COVID, getting a vaccine and then having a resolution of their symptoms. What kind of theories are floating around out there about how that could work? So, I have to say that was a very pleasant shock. A lot of my patients with long COVID were quite hesitant to get the vaccine. Dr. Griffon, I'm sorry to finally feel a little bit better. What if I get the vaccine and I just lose all this ground? And so, I scheduled to see my patients a couple weeks after that vaccine and low and behold, a chunk of them said Dr. Griffon. I don't understand what happened, but my brain fog is gone, my fever has resolved. I can smell again, my fatigue. I mean, it was really tremendous to say. There's a couple ideas. I was actually reading an article by Akiko up at Yale and I was waiting to see my name because everything she wrote was exactly what I think. And it was a competing idea. One is this idea that a lot of people with long COVID never really clear the virus. That there's some sort of low level viral persistence, particularly in the gut. This is a virus of the gut. This is a diarrhea virus in bats. So, that's one idea. And the idea is you get the virus and you finally clear that. Finally, that anogenic that stimuli that persistent virus is cleared. So, that's one idea. The others are something wrong with the immune system. The immune system has never really had a proper response. Now, with the vaccine, you get a nice robust proper response. And when you come down from that, you actually have a proper sort of post inflammatory calming of this immune dysfunction. Those are really the big, really the big competing theories. Is it the virus or is it the immune system? So interesting. And I also wanted to ask you about monoclonal since you've done a lot of research around that. Are you starting to see more uptake from hospitals with monoclonal, I know for a while they were available. They were sitting on shelves. They weren't getting used. Is the utilization kind of rates gone up? So, the utilization rates of monoclonal is really shot up recently. And I think a lot of people were waiting for the big phase three trials. And this last week, we saw a couple phase three trials come out. We saw data from Eli Lilly with their cocktail showing 87 percent reduction of people progressing to end up in the hospital or require any medical care. We also saw an absolute mortality reduction. Those people in the placebo group that did go on to end up in the hospital quarter of them died. Nobody in the monoclonal therapy group died. VIRGSK, that's a conglaboration. They came out with their data also showing 85 percent protection reduction in people progressing. So, I think when these big phase three trials came out, people got really excited. Early on, I think the timing was off. In early April, Steve Katani, a United Health Group, and I had a conversation with the folks at Regeneron. And we said, what do you do in testing your antibodies in week three of illness? We already had an idea at that point that there were different phases in timing would matter. And those trials did basically show. If you wait, you give this too late, it's useless. But now we're seeing really compelling data. You get this in in that first week and it's actually pretty miraculous, the benefit. If a patient ends up in the hospital with COVID-19 or a loved one ends up in the hospital, and they ask for monoclonals and they say something like, sorry, we don't have any here, we don't do that here, what should the patient do? What can they do to advocate for themselves? Yeah, so the key thing with monoclonals is this is a first seven to day, seven to ten day therapy. This is not something you get once you've already been in the hospital requiring oxygen. At that point, you're not doing anything helpful, but even be harmful. But during that first seven to ten days, you can get monoclonals in a lot of different places. And one of the biggest things, the internet has opened up the world. So if you type in got COVID, that actually bring you, I'm going to thank survivor core for this. They set up a really nice website, which allows you to click a few times. You can either find out a local care facility like an acute care hospital for the products. You can go to United in research where we'll actually within 24 hours, deliver you monoclonals in your own home throughout the entire US. Or if you don't qualify to the current guidelines, there's actually a bunch of ongoing research trials that people can take a look out. So yeah, there's nowhere in this country that you should not be able to get monoclonals within 24 hours. You might have to drive a little bit, but a lot of times you don't have to drive it all. You can stay home and we can actually get them delivered to you in the home. And I should I mention it's for free. Right. It's amazing. You're a tax dollars at work. Because you know what, to be honest, not only is it a great thing, but it makes sense. It is much cheaper as a country to treat someone, to cure them, to keep them at home, than to let them go on to develop COVID, to end up in the hospital. Absolutely. And any side effects or complications that you're seeing from monoclonal treatment? Yeah. So we've now given this to thousands of people. It's actually generally well tolerated. A few individuals we have seen that they'll get a fast heart rate. They might feel a little bit faint, but incredibly well tolerated, incredibly safe therapies. Well, I want to ask you a little bit about the work that you do, Dr. Griffin. You are an instructor at Columbia University. You are a regular contributor to this week in biology and give those excellent clinical updates. You're also very involved with parasites without borders. Can you tell us more about what that organization does? Yeah, I have to say it was really fortunate that parasites without borders existed going into this pandemic because we're a non-profit. We're completely supported by donations so we don't have to answer to anyone. So in our collaboration with microobe TV, it really allowed us to give unbiased, solid scientific guidance during this pandemic. So we really had a commitment to what is the science telling us? Let's get that science out there. I didn't have to answer to any political figures. I had a great team going through the literature, sort of keeping me updated on why I couldn't sleep, but what I needed to read instead. And through this platform, we've been able to every week, we put out the articles that you should be reading, not just the headline, but the whole article. We come out every week on this weekend by relative with our clinical updates where I try to take what I'm seeing on the ground and what we're hearing from the scientists looking at this, put it together into something that makes sense. It's been great in creating a forum for a lot of physicians and scientists to communicate, really allowed us to take clinical observations and translate these into studies that really give us solid data on what treatments work, what mitigation strategies work. So it's been tremendous that that was in place to allow us to give this information to everyone. You are an MD PhD. And what has been your path to becoming a clinician and a scientist? What got you inspired to get into medicine and what got you inspired so much that you have wanted to get both your MD and your PhD? Well, it was a long path. And I always played my parents for like thwarting my dreams of becoming a plumber, which you know, I say it would have been financially better. But I as a teenager was living in Greenwich Village when the when the HIV crisis happened. And I don't know if people know this, but there was this young, excited, energetic, infectious disease doctor. And my mother was the was the community member on the task force with this young Anthony Fauci. And that was actually some of my first exposures seeing what was going on, volunteering at St. Vincent's Hospital. And then later I ended up in medical school, trained there in New York City at NYU. And then the crisis was continuing. And then after my early training actually spent 10 years in rural Colorado as a primary care doc. And it was after that experience that I went back, did my PhD, and got into this MD PhD arena. So, doing a mix of mainly clinical, mainly seeing patients, but still doing research, still publishing, still trying to contribute to the to the literature. So, you know, I blame my parents, getting me getting me down this road. But yeah, I think I've been really fortunate to be in this position. Hopefully having the, well, my PhD in immunology, which really helped a lot, my advanced training and infectious disease. And then all the other global health public health training that I've had over the years to really, really, because you needed the training before the pandemic started. So, I was glad to have gotten it. What does a typical day look like for you now with all these different hats that you wear and clinical duties? Yeah, it usually starts with me waking early and reading all the papers. And then heading off to the hospital. Usually mornings at the hospital, I'm doing consults on the complicated patients. So, my role is often a physician will call and say, you know, Dr. Griffin, this is complicated. Can you jump in and help us out? Going, seeing the patients, talking to them, helping come up with a treatment plan. So, in the office, seeing out patients. And then through the day, lots of phone calls, lots of communications with other other physicians in our urgent care centers and all our primary care sites. And then speckled through the week are my connections with the United Health Group and all our research projects. So, and then at the end of the day, I think last night it was about 1040, time to put Barnaby to bed and then a couple more hours of reading before going to sleep. Very full days. What are some of your favorite sources for getting information about the pandemic? You know, it has really changed. So, you know, my greatest strength, I think, is all my friends and colleagues who help guide me towards which papers I should be paying attention to. So, people like Vincent and Dixon and Chuck Canersh and Peter Hotez and all these people who send stuff my way and say, hey, you should take a look at this. So, that has really been great. We used to look at basically major journals, but we've now shifted towards the preprints, right? And before the pandemic, I had never ever put a preprint up there. I also would ignore the preprints. You needed to see it peer reviewed. So, now a lot of the preprint servers, the first time I see things, but then once they come out in different journals, then I'm seeing them as well. So, it's really broad. You know, it used to be you watched the New England Journal, you watched the clinical infectious disease, open forum infectious disease, the Lancet. Now it's amazing the number of different sources where we have to look to get all the most up-to-date data. As we look back on this pandemic, and we've been dealing with it for over a year now, what are some major lessons that you hope that we can learn as a society and as a medical community? As we move forward, hopefully to a much better place with this pandemic, and as we look ahead to other potential pandemics. I think one of the biggest things we learned is that it's really important that our public health and our scientific institutions are separated from politics. I think we even continue, I had to say, to this day, there's politics in the response. And we have to be careful about that. We want our society to get the truth, to get the science. We don't need to dumb it down. I actually think we have a bright population who would rather be educated up than spoken down to. And I think a lot of the different communications that have been put in place, we're going to have to preserve these. We really on the fly had to build up our COVID update through parasites without borders. We really had to ramp up our micro-TV communications. I think it's going to be critical going forward that the CDC maintains its autonomy. The FDA keeps their autonomy and the communication is really separated from the politics. I think this pandemic was predicted. People say who could have seen this coming? Well, actually a lot of us have been predicting it for a while. We're also concerned that there's a next pandemic on the rise, and if we don't change. So hopefully we have learned these lessons. I know we'd like to just forget this year ever happen and move forward, but let's not forget this year ever happen. Let's learn these lessons so we can never have to experience this again. Any other items that you want to share before we sign off? Well, I know a lot of people have been worried about the variants lately. They say it's erased the variants against the vaccines. I like to think we're winning. We are cranking out those vaccines. We are doing millions a day. We are going to below right pass that 100 million people vaccinated in the first 100 days. And I really think there's every reason to believe that come this summer. We're going to be in good shape. But let's just keep an eye on the kids. The kids won't be vaccinated. Come July 4th. So just because we're safe, we still have a responsibility to keep our kids safe and realize that being at low risk does not mean being at no risk for our children. Well, Dr. Griffin really enjoyed chatting with you today. Thanks so much for your research, for your clinical updates on this week in biology and your leadership during this pandemic. Really appreciate it. No, thank you Kyle. It's great to have this opportunity. I know a lot of people care about kids in COVID. So hopefully this will be helpful."
Coronavirus Update 123: COVID 19 Vaccines vs. Variants,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-02-24,9ymKocjsmUo,"We'll continue to make Cram COVID-19 update. And while the numbers are staggering as to the number of global cases and global deaths, it seems as though the numbers are starting to come down. In the United States, daily new cases have dropped precipitously. As have the daily new deaths. You can see, for instance, in California, daily new cases continue to fall. Daily new deaths in California continue to tick down overall. In fact, in San Bernardino County, where I work here in Southern California, there's been a sharp decline in hospitalizations from COVID-19. The UK has also seen a drop in new cases. As well as a drop in daily deaths. In Spain, daily new cases also continue to drop. As do daily new deaths in Spain. But there are spots around the world where this is not happening as precipitously. For instance, daily new cases in Brazil seem to have leveled off and are not coming down. The same can be said for daily new deaths in Brazil. In Germany, where cases have fallen, there seems to be a leveling off or plateauing of the daily new cases. This is while daily new deaths in Germany continue to fall. Is there more information behind this trend? Well as it turns out, there is some information. Authorities are noticing that COVID infections are rising again in Germany, just as schools are planning on reopening in 10 of 16 states in Germany. And experts believe that what's driving this is more infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2. And specifically in this story by DW, the concern is that it's the UK variant spreading in Germany that's causing this increase in cases. Now, at a press conference, the German Health Minister, Jen Spahn, told reporters that 22 percent of all the new infections in Germany was related to the B-117 coronavirus variant and realized that just two weeks ago, this variant was only 6 percent of new infections in Germany. So they've got to assume, according to Health Minister, that this variant is soon going to become the dominant variant in Germany and perhaps around the world, as well as potentially other variants, for instance, the one from South Africa. And as a result of this, Germany is currently banning travel from Austria and Czech Republic regions. And remember that all this is happening amongst the push for elementary schools in Germany to reopen. And I guess a possible answer is going to be to accelerate vaccination of teachers to keep schools open. And of course, that is the same question that we have here in the United States. And here you can see a map showing the 50 states where, as you can see in grey, there is no state order either way to open or close the schools. And so it's left up to the counties and the school districts. Notably, the squares that are colored either show in green that they've been ordered to be reopened. Orange that there's a partial closure in effect. Red shows full closure in effect. Or the lighter orange in West Virginia, for instance, where some grades have been ordered open. The big question right now is whether or not this decrease in the numbers is going to stick around for a while, or if it's just a pivot point, and we're going to go back up again with the variants. And this medical news today article actually went a long way in looking at the current data and telling us how well the vaccines are going to hold up against these variants. So there are currently three different variants that we're concerned about. There is the B117 variant. There is the B1351 variant. And then there is the P11 variant. Now the B117 variant is from the UK. The B1351 variant is from South Africa. And the P11 variant is from Brazil. And of course the two vaccines that we currently have available in this country, the United States, is the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine. Now there is some emerging evidence that these current vaccines have efficacy against these variants. So here's a paper that was published on the 29th of January 2021 looking specifically at that B117 UK variant and the Pfizer vaccine. And if you look at the abstract, it calls out this B117 variant. And what they do here in this study is they tested the SARS-CoV-2S pseudoviruses that have this strain or the B117 lineage spike protein with the serum of 40 participants who were vaccinated in a previously reported trial with the Pfizer vaccine. And they showed that the immune syra had slightly reduced but overall largely preserved neutralizing titers against the B117 lineage pseudovirus. Concluding them to say that these data indicate that the B117 lineage will not escape the Pfizer mediated protection. And here you can see a graph of the PVNT50 which is basically a way of quantifying neutralizing antibodies. And as you can see here, the reference between the initial Wuhan reference virus and the B117 variant, the difference is very, very small. And here's another paper that was published this time in cell titled Reduce Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B117 variant by Convalescent and Vaccine Syra. And even though the B117 was harder to neutralize than the parental virus, they did not notice widespread escape from monoclonal antibodies or antibody responses generated by natural infection or vaccination. So if we go back to our chart, it looks like we're okay here in this situation, meaning that the Pfizer vaccine seems to be able to take care of the B117 variant. Well, what about Moderna? How does it fare against these variants? Now, there is a paper that has not been peer-reviewed or published but is on the Medical Archive Server titled mRNA-1273 which of course is the Moderna vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies against spike mutants from global SARS-CoV-2 variants. And in this study, what they did was they assessed the neutralizing capacity of Syra from human subjects and non-human primates that received the Moderna vaccine. And what they found was that there was no significant impact on neutralization against the B117 variant. They did notice that there was an impact on neutralization somewhat on the B1351 variant, but taken together they said these data demonstrate reduced but still significant neutralization against the full B1351 variant following the Moderna vaccination. And of course, we'll give a link to this preprint in the description below. And of course, this preprint led them to release a press release titled Moderna COVID-19 vaccine retains neutralizing activity against emerging variants first identified in the UK and in the Republic of South Africa. And in this release, they're pretty confident that the Moderna vaccine is going to be very good still against the B117 variant. They also make that somewhat against the B1351 variant, the one from South Africa. However, they did notice that there was an antibody tighter that was approximately six fold lower relative to prior variants. And they say here that these lower titers may suggest a potential risk of earlier waning of immunity to the new B1351 strain. So if we look at the B117 from the UK, it looks as though we're good for the Moderna and plus minus on the South African B1351 variant. But remember that something that both Pfizer and Moderna would want you to remember, of course, is here we're just looking at B cells in terms of antibody titers. But this does not take into consideration is T cell response. And remember, there is a T cell response to these vaccinations. Currently we don't have data on the P1 variant. So time will tell whether or not the vaccines that we currently have are going to be effective enough against these variants. But what are the vaccine manufacturers doing just in case? In fact, what they're doing is they are taking another look at those variants and coming up with a quote copy and paste way of producing a booster that will be effective against those variants. In fact, both companies, Pfizer and Moderna are looking at doing that in about six to nine weeks by sequencing the RNA of the portion of the genome in the SARS-CoV-2 that makes the spike protein in a modified variant way. We can now engineer the appropriate vaccine so that the response against that vaccine is more robust than the current vaccine model. For more information on how these mRNA vaccines work, check out our interview with Shane Crottie and also to find out more about how vitamin D might be involved with COVID-19, check out our video on vitamin D. Thanks for joining us."
Coronavirus Update 122: The Research So Far on COVID-19 and Vaccines vs. Pregnancy,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-02-15,qDfnkNhpXiw,"So in this video, what we're going to do is talk about the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy. And specifically, we're going to look at outcomes, for instance, with maternal mortality and the ability to take pregnancy to full terms or look at preterm labor, et cetera. And we're also going to look at the effects of pregnancy on COVID-19. In other words, what are the effects of being pregnant on outcomes such as the need to be admitted to the intensive care unit or the chances of needing mechanical ventilation? Then we're also going to look at the effects of pregnancy on the vaccine and vaccine efficacy. How well is the vaccine going to work if somebody is pregnant? And then we're also going to look at the effects of the vaccine on pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. In other words, does getting the vaccine affect the ability of the mother to take the pregnancy to full term? Let's start first of all with what is the effect of COVID-19 on the outcomes of pregnancy? And I'd like to thank Dr. Victoria Mail, a reproductive immunologist at the Imperial College in London. She put together this document and will put a link in the description below. I'd like to also add that there's a separate video where she sat down with Kyle Allred and discussed with him the finer details of this topic. So the first thing we have to ask is what is the effect of COVID-19 on patients who are pregnant? And when we look at this topic of what is the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy, you've got to understand that different studies have different levels of evidence. And once again, the prospective study is going to be better in terms of weight than a retrospective study or an observational study. The problem is, of course, that early on in the pandemic, most of the studies that come out are retrospective or observational. So let's look at those as they were coming out. So this paper came out in November of 2020 title, pregnancy outcomes among women with and without severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus, to infection. Basically, what they're asking here is what is the effect of SARS-CoV-2 positivity on pregnancy? So in the study, we had patients who were pregnant and 252 were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 3122 were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And what they essentially found in this study is that there was no difference in these two cohorts with respect to preterm birth, preeclampsia, C-section rate, or abnormal heart rate. Also, importantly, is then when they took the placenta out and they gave it to the pathologist, the pathologist was blinded as to whether or not the patient was SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative. And what they did was they found no placental abnormalities. And that's important because there has been some discussion about antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus potentially cross-reacting with a protein in the placenta. But here, there were no differences in terms of microscopic analysis of the placenta. So at least in this study, which was retrospective, there didn't seem to be much effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy. Here was another study, again, a retrospective cohort study looking at early pregnancy and asymptomatic women with COVID-19. We'll call this the asymptomatic study. So in this study, they took about 113 women in the first trimester that were coming in for their first trimester evaluation. And they compared it to 172 that had come in the year previous. Now, in this situation, we don't know if they were positive or negative. We're just looking at patients in the first trimester in the era of a pandemic versus in the era without a pandemic. And what you can see here is that the viable clinical pregnancy rates were not different between the two groups. There was no significant difference seen in the total number of arrested pregnancies or in each type of miscarriage. And so the conclusion of this study was that the COVID-19 pandemic environment does not seem to affect early first trimester miscarriage rates in asymptomatic patients. And so this retrospective study, again, showed no difference or no effect at this point on COVID-19 with pregnancy. Now, here's another case control study that was published last year. And it was studied out of Italy again, a case control study titled coronavirus disease 2019 and first trimester spontaneous abortion, a case control study of 225 pregnant patients. Again, we're looking at the possibility that COVID-19 may affect pregnant patients. And so we'll call this the Italian study. And as part of their case control, they looked at a case of spontaneous abortion and the control was ongoing pregnancy. There were 100 subjects in the spontaneous abortion group and there was 125 in the ongoing pregnancy group. And then what they did was they looked to see what the prevalence was of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. And they found that in the spontaneous abortion group, it was 11 percent, and in the ongoing pregnancy group, it was 9.6 percent. But the p-value here was 0.73, which was not statistically significant. In other words, to say that there was no difference between these two values. Again, retrospective data indicating that COVID-19 did not have effects on pregnancy outcomes. But as we've said, we would rather have prospective studies and large studies at that. And so have there been studies? And the answer to that question is yes. Enter this study titled Clinical Manifestations, Risk Factors, and Maternal and Parynatal Outcomes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in pregnancy, living systematic review and meta-analysis. So this is a massive study that actually is a meta-analysis of 77 other studies, which were included, and represent over 11,000 patients, patients of pregnant and recently pregnant women attending or admitted to the hospital for any reason, and were diagnosed as having suspected or confirmed COVID-19. So this is really where you're going to want to see and look for data. So what does this study say about the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy? So here is table one in that study. And we're actually to come back to this study later on in the video, because we're going to talk about the effect of pregnancy on the outcomes of COVID-19. But for now, let's be focusing on the comparison group of pregnant women without COVID-19. So in other words, we're trying to see what the effect of COVID-19 is on pregnancy, and so we're going to compare it to those women who are pregnant without COVID-19. And the way to do that is looking at the odds ratio. If something is greater than one, then there is an increased odds of something. And if we look at the 95 percent confidence interval, and it includes one, then that means it's not statistically significant because the effect is one times that amount. What I mean to say here is that we can say something is statistically significant if the lower range is above one. We could say here that COVID-19 was not statistically significant in terms of all cause mortality from maternal outcomes. In other words, it did not seem to increase all cause mortality. However, if we look at ICU admission for the maternal outcome, because the 95 percent confidence interval is well above 1.0, we can say that COVID-19 statistically significantly increased the ICU admission rate for maternal outcomes. What about preterm birth? Again, here we see 1.16 to 7.85, meaning that COVID-19 statistically significantly increased the risk of preterm birth. It did not increase the risk of cesarean section. What about perinatal outcomes? So what about the baby? Here we see that COVID-19 did not statistically increase the risk of stillbirth. Did not statistically increase the risk of neonatal death. It did increase the risk of admission to a neonatal unit. It did not increase the abnormal APGAR score at 5 minutes. That's a score that is used to grade how the appearance of the baby is at 5 minutes in this case. And it did not increase the risk of fetal distress. And so one of the conclusions that was come to in this study was that preterm birth rates are high in pregnant women with COVID-19 over those women who are pregnant without COVID-19. And in this case, the preterm birth rate was about three times higher, and that was based on an N number of 339 subjects that were looked at in this meta-analysis. So it seems as though if we ask the question, what is the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy? It seems as though it can increase the risk of preterm birth, and it increases the risk of admission to a neonatal unit. Now another question is, what is the effect of pregnancy on the outcomes of COVID-19? And that's the second question that we're going to tackle. So now we're asking a different type of question. We're asking the question is, what is the effect of pregnancy on the outcomes of COVID-19? And for that, we go back to our JAMA study, which was a retrospective study. This is the one titled, pregnancy outcomes among women within without severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus to infection. And this was a study where 95 percent of these women were asymptomatic or mild, and only about 5 percent had severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. And what they found in the conclusions and relevance was that placental abnormalities were not associated with disease severity. And hospitalization frequency was similar to rates among non-pregnant women. And so it would seem in this retrospective study that the status of pregnancy really didn't affect how severe the COVID-19 would progress. But once again, this is a retrospective study and really not the top form of data and evidence that we need to make that kind of decision, known fact what we need is a randomized controlled trial or even a meta-analysis of many randomized controlled trials. And so for that, we go to our meta-analysis that was published in the British Medical Journal, clinical manifestation, risk factors, and maternal and perinatal outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy, living, systematic review, and meta-analysis. Again, this was a meta-analysis looking at over 11,000 patients. And what it found was that pregnant COVID patients are more likely to need ICU care than non-pregnant patients. Again, now looking at the top part of table one, here we're looking at the comparison group as non-pregnant women of reproductive age with COVID-19. So what happens here when we are looking at pregnant women with COVID-19? We see that there is no statistically significant increase in all-caused mortality, but that being pregnant does increase your risk of ICU admission, does increase your risk of invasive ventilation, does not increase your risk of ECMO, does not increase your risk of oxygen through nasal cannula, does not increase your risk of ARDS or of major organ failure. The other thing that they looked at in terms of pregnancy is they found that pregnant patients with COVID-19 were less likely to have fever and also myalges as symptoms. And you can see here in the meta-analysis that they did when they combined this to the subtotal, they found that the confidence interval was very small, which was very good. And also it was very significantly less than one, meaning that pregnant patients who have COVID-19 are less likely to have myalges as a symptom and also fevers as a symptom as you can see here, the subtotal was less than one. And so all of this led the authors of this paper to conclude that pregnant and recently pregnant women are less likely to manifest COVID-19 related symptoms of fever and myalgia than non-pregnant women of reproductive age and are potentially more likely to need intensive care treatment for COVID-19, pre-existing comorbidities like high maternal age and high body mass index also seem to be risk factors for severe COVID-19. So this can answer the question for us of how does pregnancy affect COVID-19? It can increase the risk for ICU, it can increase the risk for ventilation, but it decreases the potential symptoms of fever and myalges. The next question that we have to face is what is the effect of pregnancy on the efficacy of a vaccine? That's the third question we're going to tackle. So pregnancy is a situation where there is an immunocompromised state and this is not hard to understand because it is at this time that the pregnant patient has within them, a fetus which is genetically different from them and so they're more tolerance of non-self. The question is, is the pregnant state affecting at all the ability of a potential vaccine to be efficacious against COVID-19? Well, the first problem is that in all of the early data tests and all of the phase one, two, and three trials for the vaccines, the state of pregnancy excluded them from those trials. Now, this doesn't mean of course to say that people didn't get pregnant after they were enrolled in the study, but one of the exclusion criteria for entrance into the trial was pregnancy. And so for that reason, we don't have data on the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. That's not to say that we don't have data. Here's a paper that was published just about a year ago, but this was looking at the influenza vaccine and it's titled Influenza Vaccine Efficacy and Effectiveness in Pregnant Women, a systematic review and meta-analysis. And this was actually a study looking at 19 other studies that were pooled from 11 different countries and they were looking at different vaccines. One was a seasonal vaccine and the other one was specifically against the H1N1. And the way that they tested them was to see whether or not they tested positive in the laboratory or whether or not there was an influenza-like illness or a respiratory infection type illness. And there were some mixed results, but the bottom line was vaccination in pregnant patients was protective against laboratory confirmed influenza. And so it would seem that pregnancies effect on the vaccine would be pretty minimal, but more data is needed. And then of course the question that many people have is what is the effect of any particular vaccine for COVID-19 on pregnancy? And that's the fourth question and the question that we're going to delve into at this time. So we want to know what is the effect of the vaccines on the pregnancy? And that could mean a patient who's not pregnant that wants to get pregnant or a patient that becomes pregnant after they've gotten the vaccine or somebody that gets the vaccine while they're pregnant. So of course the vaccines are very different and they're very different vaccines on the market. So we're going to look at three vaccines that we actually have data for. As we said before, when these studies were started, one of the exclusion criteria was that the patient was pregnant, but that of course doesn't stop people from getting pregnant after they're enrolled in the study. And there is some data on that and we will of course give a link in the description below. The first vaccine that we're going to talk about is the Pfizer vaccine. And if you want more information on the Pfizer vaccine, go to make cram update 116. But briefly this is an mRNA vaccine and it is two shots. And as part of the safety testing, they did studies on rats. And rats were given the vaccine both pre-mating and also during their gestation. That means while they were pregnant. So what did they find? They found number one in the studies that antibodies were found in the maternal rats. They also found that antibodies were found in the fetus. And number three, they found that antibodies were also found in the offspring after they were born. They found no effects on fertility, no effects on pregnancy in these rats, and no effect on fetal development. In these studies, there was no data on placental transfer. That means the antibodies going through the placenta. And there was no data on the presence of antibodies in the milk. Okay, let's talk about Moderna. And if you want more information about the Moderna vaccine, go to make cram update 117. You'll know that Moderna is also an mRNA vaccine and it's also given in two shots. They did very similar to the Pfizer vaccine. They also gave it to rats and the vaccine. And they found very similarly that there was no effect on female reproduction, development or postnatal development. Next, we're going to talk about the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. And if you want to follow that, look at make cram update 118. And currently, as it turns out, animal studies are still pending on this vaccine. Now, as I told you in these trials for these vaccines, patients have gotten pregnant. And of course, we'll give you the link to the data on that in the description below. But let me just summarize it for you since we have it here. So in the Pfizer group, there were 23 patients in the entire study that became pregnant after enrollment. Now, we're not told how many of those were in the vaccinated group and how many were in the control group. But we do know that there was one miscarriage in the control group. In the Moderna trial, there were 13 subjects that became pregnant after enrollment in the study. And we are told here that there were six in the vaccine arm. And there were seven in the control arm. Now, in those arms, there were zero miscarriages in the vaccine group and one miscarriage in the control group. In the Oxford AstraZeneca trial, there were 21 patients that became pregnant. And in the vaccine arm, there were 12 and in the control, there were nine. Two in the vaccinated group had a miscarriage and three in the control group had a miscarriage. Now, while these numbers are not powered to be able to tell us about fertility, at least preliminarily, there doesn't seem to be a huge difference between the number of patients enrolled in the study who got pregnant that were in the vaccination arm versus the control arm. And while these numbers are pretty low, the same conclusion can kind of be made preliminarily here with the miscarriage rates as well. But I stress again that they're going to need to follow this data and continue to watch it to see whether or not anything emerges. But you can see clearly that patients who have taken the vaccine have gotten pregnant along the lines of the numbers of those who got placebo. So looking at accidental pregnancies in the clinical trials for the vaccines is just one way of evaluating the effect of the vaccine on pregnancy. Another way is through the vaccine adverse event reporting system. The VA ERS is a way of allowing the public to report an adverse event after they've been vaccinated. This system allows patients and providers to notify the reporting system about an adverse reaction that has occurred. And so because of the millions and millions of people that have been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines, we're going to expect a number of adverse events. For example, about 10 to 20 percent of known pregnancies ended in miscarriage, unfortunately. In other words, the background level of miscarriage is 10 to 20 percent. So with thousands of pregnant women getting vaccinated or finding out that they're pregnant after getting vaccinated, you expect a relatively large number of miscarriages to be reported to this system. Some people have incorrectly stated that reports to the system mean that a vaccine or medication caused the adverse event. In reality, what we want to know is if the rate of a particular adverse event is greater than the background level. And so I would expect to see adverse events that happen in normal everyday life like autoimmune diseases and other reactions and chronic diseases. The question of course is whether or not there is a higher proportion of these events among patients who have been vaccinated. And so we can do our part by making sure that if there is an adverse event that it is reported to the VA ERS. And of course we'll put a link to that site in the description below. And so if we go back to our original question and we asked the question, how does the vaccine affect pregnancy with at least the ones that we have reviewed, it seems to be that there is no if minimal effect of the vaccine on pregnancy. So to review, it looks as though there is an effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy in that it causes an increased risk of preterm birth and increased risk of admission to the neonatal unit. There seems to be an effect of pregnancy on COVID-19 in that it can increase ICU admission and ventilator requirement. And it does apparently reduce the symptoms of fevers and myelges. The effect of pregnancy on the vaccine we believe is probably minimal, although we don't have studies yet to fully assess that. And then again, preliminary data seems to show that the vaccines affect on people who are pregnant seems to be minimal. But again, more data is needed to fully fill out and make robust that data. Please click here to watch our interview with Dr. Victoria Meal, an expert in reproductive immunology as she does a deep dive into the topic of COVID vaccines and pregnancy."
"COVID 19 and Pregnancy: Vaccines, Fertility, & Breastfeeding with Dr. Viki Male",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-02-13,fFudXb8l7H8,"Dr. Meal, you specialize in reproductive immunology at Imperial College in London. So you're a great expert to talk to about a variety of questions related to COVID-19 and pregnancy, how safe are vaccines during pregnancy, and what about breastfeeding questions as well. But to start, I'd like to ask you just a general question about what happens, if someone gets pregnant, what happens to their immune system? Yeah, that's a really interesting question, and a long time ago in the 50s, it was suggested that maybe in pregnancy a woman's immune system would be weakened to help her to tolerate the fetus, which is, you know, after all, non-self. So it's kind of in some ways a little bit like an organ transplant. But actually, we now know that really the immune system doesn't get suppressed during pregnancy, but it does get changed in some ways. So some people with certain kinds of autoimmune diseases that are really dependent on antibodies will find that their diseases get worse during pregnancy. So you're getting a stronger antibody response. But people who have autoimmune diseases that more rely on things like T cells might find that their disease gets better during pregnancy. And similarly, we see that pregnant women are more susceptible to some infectious diseases, and for some infectious diseases, it makes no difference. And for some infectious diseases, actually, they seem to do a little bit better. I want to start right away with a rumor that's been circulating a bit on the internet, and it's about fertility and vaccines, specifically the COVID-19 vaccines. Is there any evidence that getting a COVID-19 vaccine reduces fertility for a woman? No, there's no evidence at all that this is the case. And we actually have several strands of evidence that it won't reduce fertility. To me, probably the strongest strands of evidence are the people who got pregnant by accident during the trials. So in the trials, pregnant women weren't recruited, and they asked people not to become pregnant during the trials. But these things do sometimes happen. 53 people became pregnant unexpectedly, shall we say. And those people were equally divided across the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated groups. So clearly the vaccines aren't stopping people from getting pregnant. And those people are being followed up quite carefully, and so far they're all having normal pregnancies. So again, we can say that the vaccines aren't poorly impacting early pregnancy. We're also beginning to see some people who are getting vaccinated just in the line of perhaps because they're health care workers or whether they're on the front line, and they're also getting vaccinated shortly after they've been vaccinated. So really in people, it seems the vaccine is not stopping you getting pregnant at all. If you want to get, if you want to not get pregnant, you need to use a contraception. And we also have evidence from animals that the vaccine doesn't stop them getting pregnant either. Do you know how that rumor got started about the COVID-19 vaccines reducing fertility in women? I think I know exactly how it got started, although of course it's difficult to be sure, because a lot of things circulate for a long time on the internet before they necessarily come to the attention of people who can really fact check them. But we think that what happened was a man called Michael Yeden, who about a decade ago was employed by Pfizer for about six years. So you know, there was that aspect to it. He was suggesting that there's a certain amount in common between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or what we would call COVID-19, and a protein in the placenta, which is called Sinsitin-1. And he was proposing that because there are some similarities between these, that antibodies that attach to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 might attach to proteins in the placenta and that might cause reduced fertility. Now as it happens, we really have quite strong evidence that this won't be the case, because there's really not very much similarity between the spike protein and Sinsitin-1. And also, I know some people at Yale, Alice Lou Culligan, who's in a Kiko Iwasaki's lab, have actually made the effort and taken antibodies from people who've had COVID-19 and seen if they bind to this protein. And they don't. So it was a theoretical concern, and we have good evidence to suggest that it won't happen. But because of the way that this was reported, it was said, oh, expert who's working at Pfizer says that this is a big concern, that is really, I think, why it took off. And although the report was taken down quite quickly, it got screenshotted and it got shared a lot on WhatsApp. Before, people like me really found out about it and started saying, well, this is probably not true. Now what about with a natural infection? If someone gets COVID-19, any chance that that could reduce their fertility? Well, this is one of the things that we have been on the lookout for, because you can imagine that it might. But so far, the evidence seems to suggest that people who have COVID-19 early in their pregnancies, or people who have COVID-19 and then go on to become pregnant, seem to have absolutely normal pregnancies. So COVID-19 early in pregnancy, as far as we can tell, is not a problem. Later pregnancy though, it can be. Okay. So what happens later in pregnancy? Well, later in pregnancy, we find that people who get COVID-19 are more likely to need to go into intensive care than women who are the same age, but who are not pregnant. And if you compare them to other pregnant women who don't have COVID-19, there are about three times more likely to give birth early. And their baby is about three times more likely to need to go into the neonatal care unit. So for this reason, COVID-19 is definitely something that's worth your while trying to avoid when you're further along in your pregnancy. And from a fertility standpoint, just a woman's ability to get pregnant and maintain that pregnancy, you know, full term, are there any viruses, other viruses besides the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 that have impacted fertility negatively that we can learn from? Oh, I'm not sure if there are definitely viruses that impact fertility negatively, but they're not very similar to SARS-CoV-2. So I don't know how much we can learn from them. So an obvious example would be human papilloma virus, which causes cervical cancer. If you get cervical cancer, it can make your cervix a bit less competent or, you know, the extreme end, if you end up having to have a hysterectomy, that is extremely bad for your fertility. Similarly, we have things like rebella, which are if we take a broad view of fertility bad for your fertility, because if you get infected while you're pregnant, then you can have congenital rebella. And there are also other congenital viruses like that. The other one that's worth thinking about, I suppose, is influenza. And the reason I'd like to think about that is not so much because it's bad for your fertility, but because it's dangerous during pregnancy. And this is one of the things that we actively vaccinate pregnant women against in order to protect them and their babies. Are pregnant women any more likely to get COVID-19 than the general population? So this is a really interesting question, actually. And I would say that what the evidence so far seems to say, and it's difficult to tell because pregnant women in lots of places are being more careful than their non-pregnant counterparts, and you can understand why. But it seems to be the case that they're not more likely to catch COVID-19. And kind of early in pregnancy, actually, they tend more often to not have things like fever or the kind of classical symptoms. And this might be because of that slight difference in the immune system that I mentioned in pregnancy. So in some ways, actually, early in pregnancy, they may do better. I were pregnant women excluded from the initial vaccine trials for the COVID-19 vaccines. And do you agree with that decision to exclude them from the trials? So they were excluded from the trials, I would say, because that's standard practice when you're trying a new medicine, just because in case there's something really surprising and unexpected. For these vaccines, we have no reason to believe that they would harm pregnancy, but just in case there was something we were not expecting, it would be bad if we had included a lot of pregnant women and the impacts would be not just on them, but also potentially on their babies. So that's why we usually don't include pregnant people in trials. However, there is an argument for these trials because we're in a situation where we should have known that as soon as the vaccines were approved for use, that we were going to have to give them to pregnant people, because so many health care staff are women of reproductive age who are having babies because that's what women of reproductive age often do. So we should have known that we would need to quite quickly deal with this question of whether it would be safe to give pregnant women the vaccine. And I think actually that in the end, we have come to a reasonably good compromise position, certainly in the United States you have, because what's happened is the vaccine has been rolled out to pregnant people who are at high risk, so the risks for them are high, which means that of COVID rather I should say, so the benefits of having the vaccine are high. And then what the US is doing is they are really tracking these people. They are absolutely tracking these people, you know, all the way. And that means that really quickly we'll know if there's any kind of problem. And that data is put out, published quite regularly, and I've been taking a look at it myself and so far, I'm going to say it raises no flag, no red flags. That's not actually my words, that's Anthony Fauci's words. So obviously some of the people who have been vaccinated have had some problems, but they've been having problems at exactly the same rate as people who haven't been vaccinated. So so far the profile, the safety profile of the COVID vaccines looks good too. And it's my hope that by the time we get to the point where we're offering the vaccine to people who aren't at high risk, where, you know, the benefits are will have a really, really good safety data, which will mean that we can offer the vaccine to these people with confidence. For pregnant women who get the COVID-19 vaccine, is there any evidence that their immunity is passed on to their developing fetus? So we know that people who get actual COVID-19 will pass some of their antibodies onto their babies. And we've seen one case report so far where a woman got the vaccine, the Moderna vaccine, three weeks before she gave birth. And when she had her baby, it was a happy and healthy baby girl. And the baby had antibodies that had come through from the mother. From the perspective of the immune system, just kind of in broad strokes, what what happens during breastfeeding? How much immunity is passed on to a baby during breastfeeding? Well some immunity is passed on to a baby during breastfeeding and we know that women who got COVID-19 naturally actually did pass on some immunity to their babies through breast milk. But it's an interesting question of whether that will happen for the vaccine, because there are five kinds of antibodies and the one that is mostly raised by the vaccine is called IgG. And that goes really well across the placenta, which is why we saw it in the baby who had antibodies from her mother getting vaccinated. But the other kind of antibody that is not so well raised by the vaccine is called IgA. And that mainly protects us at mucusal surfaces. And that's the antibody that mostly goes through in the breast milk. So we saw antibody going through in the breast milk of women who were naturally infected because those women made a good IgA response to natural infection. But the vaccine mainly makes an IgG response. And IgG doesn't really go through in the breast milk. It goes through a tiny little bit, but not very much. So one thing that will be quite interesting to see is if antibody from vaccination goes through in the breast milk. And if it does, does that give any protection to the baby? We don't have that data currently. As far as I know, we don't. I have a colleague who's actually doing this kind of a study, but I haven't seen that data yet. And how about T cells? I've learned a lot about T cells during this pandemic and their central role in immunity. And sometimes prior to the pandemic, I thought of immunity as just antibodies or just B cells that make antibodies. Are T cells transferred through breast milk as well sometimes? T cells do get into the breast milk. And there's some evidence that those can be transferred kind of across the lining of the gut. So I suppose another possibility is that there may be some anti-covid T cells that could be transferred to the baby in a breastfeeding mother. And that's also something that I know the people who are doing the breast milk studies will be looking at. If someone is breastfeeding and they haven't had the COVID-19 vaccine and they're offered it, do you think they should get it? If I were breastfeeding and I were offered the COVID-19 vaccine, I would absolutely get it. What about women who are planning on getting pregnant in the near future? I know we talked about this a little bit already, but if they're thinking, all right, the next three months or so really want to try for that, do you recommend they get the vaccine? Again, I would say that for that group of people, there's no reason not to get the vaccine. And potentially there's a good reason to get the vaccine because if you are successful in getting pregnant, you'll then find yourself in a position, you know, nine months down the line, where you really want to avoid getting COVID-19 because of those extra risks that we talked about around having a preterm baby or ending up in intensive care. And one of the best ways to avoid getting COVID-19 is to have been vaccinated. So again, for those people, vaccination looks pretty attractive. For a lot of people that want to get vaccinated, it's still going to be a number of months before they might have that opportunity. You mentioned that there's some increased risks for pregnant women if they get COVID-19. From a public health standpoint, I guess it seems obvious that pregnant women should probably be even more vigilant with regard to physical distancing, hand washing, ventilation, these strategies. Would you agree with that? And do you think it even would get to the point where they should consider taking time off work until they get offered the vaccine? That's a very difficult question because not everyone is in the position where they can take time off work. And for a lot of families, that would be a very difficult decision because you'd lose one income. What I would say, and I think pregnant women are really good at doing this anyway, is mask, hand wash, distance. And if you are able to and you feel more comfortable to take time off work, then it wouldn't be a bad idea. But I think that most people can carry on working safely if they take these precautions that we're all being asked to take. So just to summarize a bit, if a friend or a family member came to you and said, I'm pregnant and let's say they're in their second trimester of pregnancy, I'm offered the vaccine. And should I take it? In that case, I would absolutely say that from everything I've seen taking it seems to be the better option. It's protecting you against a real risk. And from everything we've seen so far, looks to be safe in pregnancy. So on the balance of risks and benefits, I think it's a good idea. And if they were in their first trimester, do you think they should consider waiting until a later trimester to take the vaccine if offered one? That's a very good question. And again, from what I've seen of the data, I would say that on the balance of risks and benefits, if you're being offered it, at this point you're being offered it because you're at high risk, you probably still are better off taking it. But I know some people have said that it's better to wait until after 20 weeks. And as far as I can work out the logic for that, it's not so much that they think there's any bigger risk before 20 weeks, but just that often things go wrong before 20 weeks because that's how pregnancies are. And they feel that if something went wrong, a woman might blame herself for having had the vaccine. So that's not really a risk and benefit decision. That's a decision that you would have to take yourself knowing how you would feel. But from my point of view, having seen the safety data so far, I would still say that if you're being offered it in your first trimester, probably it's a good idea to have it. Taking a step back from the COVID-19 pandemic, since you are an immunologist that specialises in specifically reproductive immunology, for anyone watching this that's planning on getting pregnant or maybe already is pregnant, what are just some general tips to consider to optimize immunity? Okay, so when we talk about lifestyle things we can do to improve immunity, they're always really boring because there are things that your mum probably always told you to do. So, you know, you need to healthy balance diet to get a good night's sleep, get some exercise. All of these things that you need to just be healthy are also good for your immune system. So in terms of pregnancy, you know, keep up that good work. And if you know, that's not something you've been great at so far, well, maybe this is your motivation to get better at it. Not really an immune thing, but very, very useful and important in pregnancy to take folic acid. So people who are starting to think about that might even want to start taking folic acid while they're trying to conceive and to continue taking it during their pregnancy. And then specifically speaking to your immune system during pregnancy, the main thing that I would say is important to do is you will be offered the flu vaccine, you will be offered the vaccine against hooping cough or whooping cough, depending on where you are living. It's the same disease, by the way, we just pronounce it differently. And I would recommend that you take those vaccines because they will protect you against flu, which can be bad for you as a pregnant person. And they will protect your baby against pertussis, which will be bad for your baby until he or she is able to get his or her first set of vaccinations. So those are probably the most important things to do. As you very eloquently said, there's unknowns to these vaccines. We'd of course like to have more robust data on some things. But there's also known risks to getting COVID-19, to getting influenza, to getting pertussis. Yeah, exactly. But I think one of the things that people are finding quite difficult, I think people find it difficult in general is balancing these kinds of risks because we don't have a very good instinctive feel for these kinds of things. And particularly when we're in a new situation, like for most people when they're pregnant, it might be the first time. And a lot of people will only have a couple of pregnancies in their life. So it's not something you get super experienced at, like I can set off driving in my car. And I know that I'm almost certainly not going to crash it because I've never crashed it. Whereas it's harder to assess those risks in a situation that say new view. And of course, the pandemic's new for all of us, which makes it doubly difficult. But what I'm trying to do and what I hope, you know, people's doctors and midwives will try to do with them is to have these kinds of discussions about, you know, this is exactly the risk. And this is exactly the benefit. And this is what we don't know. And with all of that together, people, I hope can make an informed choice supported by the evidence and supported by their, you know, their care team. And that's what I really hope everyone will be able to do. Well, amidst the challenge and the suffering of this pandemic, you know, I think there's been some silver linings, including more recognition of healthcare professionals, more recognition of scientists like yourself that are really, you know, contributing to our understanding of what happens with, you know, SARS-CoV-2 infection with specific instances like SARS-CoV-2 and pregnancy. So tell us a little bit about your pathway to becoming a scientist and, you know, your current position as a lecturer at the Imperial College in London. And well, I was always quite interested in the human body because when I was very little girl, I used to get up early in the morning before my parents got up. And I would watch a program which is called Once Upon a Time Life, where all the cells in the body had characters and they did stuff. And the immune system was pretty important actually because they're like the army in that story. And that's kind of what triggered my interest in the human body and probably even in the immune system. And then, you know, that ultimately led me to going to university to study biology, human biology. And I studied both pathology, which included immunology and physiology, which included human pregnancy. And I had a really inspirational teacher there called Matt Mason, who basically asked me to go and look into the intersection between these two areas. And that really set me off on looking into this. And that took me into a PhD in Cambridge, which is with my supervisor, Ashley Muffet. And I was really interested in a subset of immune cells called natural killer cells. It had a very important role in pregnancy actually in helping the placenta to implant properly during pregnancy. And then I went away for a little while. Well, I went away from Cambridge. I went to London. And I wanted to do some work not in humans, but in mice, because I thought it was important to have, you know, more than one way of looking at the immune system. And I was very interested in how in K-cell develop in the bone marrow of mice. And then I had my own baby. And because of how the funding system works, I actually ended up losing my job on the day before he was born. And that meant I was unemployed at home with a baby. And I spent a whole year basically applying to every possible job, because I was so keen to get back into science. At some point, I thought, gosh, I'm never going to get back into science. And it caused me to apply for things that I never thought I would ever have a chance of getting, including a fellowship that was funded by the Welcome Trust in the Royal Society, which allowed me to start my own lab. So I went from not even working in someone else's lab, pushing a baby round the park to starting my own lab at UCL. And I was looking at cells in K-cells in the liver. And after I've been doing that for a couple of years, Imperial said, well, why don't you come back and why don't you come back and look at these cells in the uterus, which is what you've always been very keen to do. And so I thought, that sounds like a great offer. So I moved back to Imperial just before this pandemic started. So I've kind of only just found my feet there before we had shut everything down. But we're kind of getting started back up again. So that's been my career story. Excellent. Any current research that you and your team are working on? Well, we're very interested still in natural killer cells in the lining of the uterus. And one of the things that we want to know is, are they involved in good and bad outcomes to pregnancy? So there have been some immunogenic approaches that look at this that basically say if you've got certain genes on your MK-cells, do have a good and bad outcome to pregnancy. But what we're trying to do is to look at the actual cells and to see if having them more or less activated is associated with having certain diseases. So I've got two PhD students who are working on that. And I have one PhD student who's working on another kind of cell that's related to MK-cells, called ILC3s. And she's also taking similar kinds of approaches to see if they're important for the outcome of pregnancy. Where can people follow you on social media or learn more about your work? So probably if you want to know what I'm up to, Twitter is the best place. And a lot of what I've been talking about today is a kind of stuff that I tell people about on Twitter to act as a resource for spreading information about immunology pregnancy in these vaccines. So you can follow me at Vicki Love's Fax. That's Fax F-A-C-S, which stands for Flow-Assisted Cell Sorting, which is a technique and immunology that I really love. Yeah, what is that? I'm curious. Fax, oh, Fax is just the best. So Fax is basically if we get a single cell suspension and we put antibodies on it and we've attached the antibodies to all different coloured fluorescent things so that basically each cell has the potential to shine a different colour or a different set of colours. Then we can suck the cells up one at a time, pass a series of lasers and the lasers will basically tell us what is on the cell and if we know what's on the cell, we can tell you all sorts of things about what kind of cell it is and what it's doing. So we can use that to answer really pretty much any question in immunology and your audience who've been following a lot of the studies that have been done about the immune response in COVID or the immune response to vaccines. A lot of those studies will have been done using PSYCHOMENTRY. Dr. Male, thank you so much for sharing your expertise with us today and hope to chat with you again sometime. Yeah, thank you for hopping me. It's been a pleasure."
Coronavirus Update 121: Johnson and Johnson Vaccine - Efficacy and Safety vs. Pfizer & Moderna,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-02-04,13qT7wLxkvU,"Dr. Schwel, vaccine shortages are a big story right now and certainly getting more people vaccinated is a key part of getting us out of this pandemic. There's been some big news this past week with Johnson and Johnson releasing preliminary data about their vaccine candidate. Tell us more about that. Yeah, so on January 29th, Johnson and Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals released some preliminary data on their phase three trials on their new vaccine candidate. We want to go through that data and specifically how it relates to the other two vaccines that have already received early use authorization from the FDA here in this country. But before we get into that, let's talk about the mechanism on how this new vaccine works. Now, each person has about 37 trillion cells in their body and this screen is zoomed in way into just one of those cells. Here we have the cell right here. This is the membrane of the cell. This area here is the cytoplasm and this area here is the nucleus of that cell. Now, do vaccines work on just one cell of your human body? No, they work on a number of cells and that's kind of dependent on the dose. But what we're going to do here is show what a vaccine does to a single cell and then you can multiply that and whereas before with Pfizer, Biontech and Moderna, they use lipid droplets to get the messenger RNA into the cells. This works a little bit differently. So let's go through the steps. As we can see here in step number one in the laboratory, what they've done is they've taken an adenovirus which can infect cells on its own has all the machinery to do that and simply what they've done is they've taken the DNA inside of the adenovirus and they've spliced in the information for that spike protein that is on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. And so here we have information for the cell to make the spike protein for the SARS-CoV-2 virus but it's encoded into a double stranded DNA segment in the adenovirus itself. And so this takes place in the laboratory and the vaccine is made. Now when they do this, they take out the parts of the DNA in the adenovirus that allows it to replicate. And so this virus when it infects the cell as the vaccine will not be able to replicate. So the proteins on the surface of the adenovirus are still able to interact with the proteins on the surface of human cells which then allows it to infect as we can see here. The strand of DNA in the virus which is supposed to go off to the nucleus and does and would normally tell the cell to make more adenovirus particles instead makes a messenger RNA that gets transported out into the cytoplasm where the cell machinery instead of making adenovirus particles like it would normally is now going to make SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. And the same happens exactly as we would see from this point on in the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine. So the difference here is that we're actually using an adenovirus as the mechanism or the vehicle to get the information into the cell. That's the first difference here with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. By the way, this is also very similar to how the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine works. The other difference here is that this is a DNA particle that is going into the nucleus of the cell. Again, very similar to the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine making the messenger RNA and then onto the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Okay, now we have a better understanding of how this vaccine works. I think what people really want to know is how does this vaccine stack up to Pfizer and Moderna and AstraZeneca? Kyle, based on what we're seeing here with this data, and I would caution again that this is not published peer-review data. But the data that we've been given is actually somewhat encouraging. There are some caveats to this and you have to dive deep into the numbers to get the information that you need. The first thing off is that it's a one-time shot. It's not like there's two shots like you need with the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccine. If you look at efficacy and how they define it, the definition of efficacy here is that the patient did not get moderate or severe disease. So mild was okay in terms of the definition of efficacy. Now, it's different in the other types of vaccine studies that we've looked at with Pfizer and Moderna, whereas any kind of symptoms is what they wanted for efficacy. So if you look at the efficacy of Pfizer and Moderna, that was 95 and 94 percent respectively. But remember, these were done at a time when the prevalence of variants like the UK variant, the South African variant, and the Brazilian variant, were not really that prevalent. And so what's kind of stacked against the Johnson and Johnson candidate here is that they did their studies when there was much more prevalence of these variants. And in fact, they did the studies in those very countries on purpose where those variants were. So it's going to be interesting to see how that pans out here. But if we look at the numbers and we try to compare them as best as we can, 95 percent for Pfizer, Biontech, 94 percent for Moderna, and 66 overall percent efficacy for the Johnson Johnson. But if you look deep down into that and you look and see which countries they were in, you'll start to see that, for instance, in the United States, there was a 72 percent efficacy where there's not a lot of variants in Latin America. It was 66 percent. And then of course, in South Africa, where that worrisome variant is in high prevalence, about 95 percent, there was 57 percent efficacy there. And so that on one hand, on first blush, looking at that, you're like, well, this is kind of a disappointment. But in fact, this vaccine actually gets better with age. So if you look at the data a little bit deeper, you'll see that at day 28, overall, there was an 85 percent efficacy in terms of preventing severe COVID. That means, that means hospitalization and death. Okay. And that's really what the whole purpose of trying to hit this pandemic under control is, is to prevent severe COVID-19 that caused you to go to the hospital and die. But what's really interesting about this Kyle is that as the antibodies start to be produced, it's felt that by day 49, okay. So 49 days after the vaccination and again, there's only one shot here. There was 100 percent efficacy that was preventative at severe COVID and also hospitalization. So nobody by day 49 was hospitalized or had severe or died, severe COVID-19, even in places like South Africa where the South African variant was very high. And I think that's very encouraging news. We've talked before about how mild side effects are relatively common with the COVID-19 vaccines that have been authorized so far, pain at the injection site, maybe some fever, feeling fatigue. How did the adverse effects stack up with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine versus the other ones that have been authorized so far? So the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, Kyle, it's kind of interesting. The serious adverse events were actually very low. In fact, they were lower in the intervention arm. So those people that actually got the vaccine had lower adverse events, serious adverse events than those in the placebo arm. And so it's a question is why would that be? Well, it may have been statistically or instantistically significant. What they believe is it could be related to the fact that those in the placebo arm were unprotected from getting COVID-19. And so there may have been some idea that maybe the effects of the COVID-19 that they got may have been increasing the serious adverse events like fever and the symptoms that you would get from getting COVID-19. But it brings a bigger point here is that here's a vaccine that is a one shot. It doesn't need special refrigeration and it appears as though it may actually have less side effects than the other vaccines. But we don't know that because it wasn't a direct comparison in this vaccine compared to the other vaccine. So we can't say that it has less than the other vaccines. What we could say that it's pretty low, pretty low profile of serious adverse events. Of course, scaling this vaccine up and having it fill fill the gap and increase the supply in the United States is a priority. It's a priority for every country around the world right now. So what do we know about cost of this vaccine? Yeah, so Johnson and Johnson has been committed and they've they've said this in black and white print that they are committed to using this and producing this in a nonprofit way so that it can be distributed to the world as quickly and as inexpensively as possible. Do we know anything about this vaccine and its ability to block transmission or the spread of COVID-19 to other people? No, we have not gotten that type of information at this point. You know, one of the ways that we learned about that with the, for instance, the Moderna vaccine was that there was a special screening done at the second dose of the Moderna vaccine and it was based on that data that they were able to come up with about a 67 percent reduction, two-thirds reduction in asymptomatic transmission with the Moderna vaccine. Obviously, there's no second dose here with the Johnson and Johnson. So I think we're going to be waiting for more data. There's probably going to be some blood tests and things of that nature if we want to look at that with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. Okay, Dr. Schwabben put you on the spot here. If you had a family member, a friend, come to you and say, all right, there's two vaccines in the United States that have been given emergency authorization. There's a couple other viable candidates. There's AstraZeneca. There's this Johnson and Johnson. Which vaccine should I get? You should get the vaccine that you could get into your, if you choose to get the vaccine, you should get the vaccine that you can get into your arm as quickly as possible. Look, thousands of people are dying every day here in the United States from COVID-19 and hundreds of thousands of people are coming down with SARS-CoV-2 infections every single day. So the one that's going all of these work effectively at preventing the worst outcome, which is hospitalization and death. I would hate to see somebody wait to get the vaccine that they think was better. And in the interim come down with a case that could be fatal. That would be a waste in my opinion. So the reason why there's so many of these is because we need so many vaccines that we can't just depend on one type of vaccine. So I'm glad there's different ones. It's another tool in our tool shed in the fight against COVID-19. I would say sign up and whichever one is closest to you in terms of timing, get that one.

"Coronavirus Mutations and COVID 19 Vaccine Implications with Shane Crotty, PhD (SARS CoV 2 Variants)",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2021-01-06,j7xsOsrDmPQ,"Welcome, I'm Kyle Allred and I'm happy to be joined again by one of the world's leading immunologists and vaccine experts, Professor Shane Crottie. I want to ask you about the mutations because these have been getting so much attention in the news and people are worried about them. Could you first just describe the landscape of these mutations and the variants that have been discovered and then what that could mean for vaccines? The virus is constantly mutating and that's that that is a normal thing for viruses and I think as as we discussed last time what's a pretty common thing to happen is what happens in the case of say polio and measles where the virus will mutate over time but not in ways that can escape the immune system because the immune response is essentially broad enough and the virus has only certain ways it can mutate and still be a functional virus. And so that's why the polio vaccine works still today, 70 years later and the measles vaccine works today still you know something like 70 years later because they're still recognizing the same virus the exact sequence of the virus has changed over time but it's still it's still seen by the immune system in largely the same way. Now SARS-2 is a new virus and there's certainly a lot of concern about how it's going to behave over time. One of the things that's been observed let's say up through November okay there were lots of lots of thousands of individual variants that had been observed and and the changes people are most concerned about are in the the spike protein which is what the antibodies recognize and then particularly the RBD domain of the spike protein which is which is what the majority of the neutralizing antibodies recognize that one piece of spike and several of the viral mutants that had been seen that had changes had mutations in the RBD again up through November really haven't been concerning. So one of them is position 614 and that's just the number of the amino acid position in the protein so the spike protein is like 1,200 amino acids long and so position 614 is one specific spot in that and that's the variant that swept the globe and so now that's the standard variant that's around and people have checked and if you take blood samples from 100 people and ask can those blood samples stop can antibodies in those blood samples stop that new variant versus the old variant the answers yes and there was really overall no difference so it's a variant that made the virus better in some ways the virus was evolutionarily more fit until it has gone through the population better but it didn't change the way the immune system really recognizes the virus overall and so those plus a lot of other pieces of data about other variants have have largely painted a picture of yes the virus might might change one spot or another but the immune system is seeing the virus broadly enough that it doesn't matter which is which is what I used my computer mouse for the last time right when I talked to them they will you know if that's if that's the spike protein or if that's the RBD domain if if all of your antibodies are just recognizing this one wheel this one spot and the virus mutates that one thing well now you're in trouble because now the immune system can't see it but if if you've got antibodies that are recognizing all kinds of surfaces here the fact that one piece of that surface is now changed yes those particular antibodies might not bind anymore but but there are plenty of other antibodies that do bind and so and so you're still you're still okay and so that's why you want to see antibody responses in a number of people something like a hundred people measured with an original virus and a variant virus do they do they look largely well so the same or not not through November it's it's looked pretty good that the virus probably is making mutations that make the virus more evolutionarily fit you know to basically replicate in in the respiratory track or or things like this but but the immune systems recognizing the virus in in in the same way now there are two variants that are are major variants of concern and VOC so with it so one's called the UK variant the other is South African variant and there are multiple different reasons that those are of concern I think that the UK variants got a lot more data on it that it's clear at this point that that variant start being seen in the UK and something like September and it's spread in the UK much more than would have been expected by random and so it's clearly a more fit variant of the virus and and it's substantially more fit it's it's got a pretty large advantage quite a large advantage for for spreading in in the population so that was one and then two is that it it had quite a few mutations at once and so you most of the time you're seeing a virus with one mutation or two mutations and and this one had more than a dozen mutations and so that was a particular concern because several mutations at once might escape the immune system better than than one mutation and and then the South African variant is a similar thing where it looks like it's spreading quite rapidly through South Africa so it looks like it's got an evolutionary advantage and it's got multiple mutations at at at the same time in in the virus so really those are the two that that are of big concern and in really in terms of immune escape we just don't have the data right now we're we're still waiting to see I think what would both the vaccine companies themselves and what a number of large labs find when they when they do the test that I just described of taking blood samples from from a bunch of people at once and in compare how well did they stop the the new virus the new variant versus versus the original and and if it's if it's largely the same you know for say 95 percent of the people then then okay it's it's it's a new variant that definitely is still a concern because it's clearly spreading well spreading quickly in the population but that the expectation would be that the the immune system is is still going to be good at stopping it oh sorry and I you can take blood samples from either people who have had COVID-19 or blood samples from people who have been vaccinated right and both both of those groups are are of interest and and obviously the hope is is that uh those antibodies will be good at at stopping um the new variants whether it's a person who had had COVID-19 or um or then vaccinated and in all those cases the expectation is that T cells will still recognize these viruses because the T cells are recognizing little bits of sequence all along the genome of the virus and and Alex said his lab upstairs for me has shown now that it's a dozen helper T cell responses and a dozen killer T cell responses per person and each person's responses are different um because of uh HLA so the reason you and I can't swap kidneys um it is because our immune systems are different uh and that's that's also a way of making it harder for viruses to escape T cell pressure because it's it's different pressure in one person than than another so so these variants aren't expected to escape uh T cells uh but those the tests on the antibodies are are really pending and and we need to see a separate but related topic is um why are these viruses spreading so much more um and and and and that those mechanisms and the numbers involved uh also matter for trying to figure out how well the vaccines are going to work uh going forward not because the virus might escape but if the virus is just a lot better at attaching to epithelial cells then then it might be harder for antibodies to stop the virus from attaching to those epithelial cells it's some level it's a competition um and so uh it is certainly really important to to to gather more information on on those topics uh as quickly as possible now where it stands right now is um those they are variants of concern um uh but really overall the antibody responses people make and the T cell responses people make and the magnitude of those responses and the vaccine responses have generally looked good such that it there's really not an expectation that any given viral variant would would just escape the immune system of uh uh uh uh uh of people in general and so that's why the statements by public health officials have generally still been you know pretty supportive and scientists in general have generally been supportive that that the the thought is the vaccines are going to continue to work against against these variants um uh but the fact that they've got multiple mutations and are spreading so well and populations are reasons for concern and really trying to get uh more immunological data as quickly as possible about them. And to clarify the the testing that you're talking about to identify if these variants can escape the immune system um or uh the vaccine response these are done in a test tube right i mean they're taking blood samples from from people and then measuring uh that against these actual variants and in a test tube. Correct and in those experiments are pretty easy to describe you really um the the antibody uh function is called neutralizing antibody which is you can basically just translate that as antibodies that are stopping the virus from infecting cells so so literally what you do is you you'll mix the blood sample that has the antibodies um from a given person with a small amount of virus and you let them sit together for an hour and and and the antibodies if they're there will bind to the surface of all the viruses in the sample and it'll they'll just cover up the virus and thereby keep the virus from infecting cells so now you take that mixture and you put it on target cells and you ask do those cells get infected um and killed actually do the does the virus then kill those target cells and you can just look you you quantify the death of of the cells um and you can do very good quantitations of that in a variety way so yeah it's literally you take you take the antibodies from a person you mix them with virus and you ask can that virus still kill cells or or not it's called the neutralization essay interesting i was shocked when i saw more and more scientists saying yes we think these new variants are make do make the virus more transmissible than than some of the original variants of SARS-CoV-2 it sounds like you you agree without me i've heard some reports it's 50 percent or or more uh transmissible potentially so first question is what are your thoughts on that and second of all how does that work i'm trying to conceptualize this i mean this has been a global pandemic this virus has spread to every country in the world and uh millions and millions of cases how how does the virus get even more transmissible great questions so some of it gets into some epidemiology that is that is definitely not my expertise right and so the the estimates of 50 percent more transmissible or or numbers higher or lower really come from epidemiological calculations about looking at how many cases there are win and wear and comparing that with this strain versus a different strain and comparing it in London versus suburbs or different parts in England right and uh and and those are the numbers that they've come up with they've certainly been done by multiple groups at this point which is something that you always want to see in science that the multiple different people can look at the data right and come up with um uh uh somewhat similar answers um but i think even the people who have done that have said that they're not sure that those answers would be the same in a different population right it's definitely a more transmissible virus what the what the numbers are to put on that may depend on uh on the population um how how can that be so the simplest concept is if the virus can bind to its target cells better with higher affinity stronger binding then it could be more transmissible because it's just as as you breathe in some virus if if the virus is more efficient at latching on to to its target surface um you're more likely to get an infection and those mutations will occur in spike and in that rbd domain because that's the part of the virus that actually binds to target cells and and infects them but there are a number of different factors that could uh could be changing in the virus that could affect transmissibility beyond uh beyond that when some of them are immunological some of them are not um i think the the uh the uh the piece of data that i've seen that was most worrisome to me was a clinical lab in the uk putting a out of preprint indicating that viral loads in nasal swabs from people are substantially higher and people infected with this variant than with the main strain it's going to be really important to see that done by additional labs and and and done in different ways it's the world's a complicated place in there lots of different things to to control foreign science um to me that data looked quite compelling um and they had it and it was something like 600 people 600 samples that they were analyzing and it was you know an official uk clinical lab looking at looking at their uh their samples but it was a there were big differences in viral load and so if that's true it's it would it would say that uh this uk variant has has a mass the set of mutations that let it grow a lot better in in nasal passages than than the previous virus and then there's literally just a lot more virus in people's nose which then if if that's happening it's pretty easy to understand how that's more transmissible because you're just you're breathing more of it out right so if there if there's just more uh virus coming out of you when you're breathing or sneezing or coughing then then obviously it's it's going to be more likely to be able to infect people near you um in that the previous main variant that swept the globe it was it was something like a two to fourfold difference which was a substantial increase and so that that was a pretty big um bump um but then this one at least in this one piece of data appears to be even more which is definitely concerning and so it's uh hopefully there'll be more data on it even in the next week hopefully by other people looking at the same types of data but it's still quite plausible that that even if that is the case that the vaccines will work uh reasonably well against such a virus because when you're already at 95 percent you know protective efficacy that's a really high level and so it's it's plausible that that that will hold up reasonably well even even in the face of a virus that's uh growing significantly more than than than than the previous variant um but there are lots of complexities and unknowns to that there's there's no uh there's no quick way to analyze that that type of data that's that's really the type of thing that you you just literally have to see how well does the vaccine actually protect people against against such a variant i know there's no way for you or anyone else to predict what will happen but it is a possibility that a vaccine these RNA vaccines that have 95 percent efficacy against disease at this point could drop below say even 50 percent if there if a variant has enough mutations involved well let's just play with some numbers that are available right there's not there's very little data on this particular topic available and there's there's no clear reference point um for comparison but one piece of data again it's not definitive but it's a piece was that the the Moderna vaccine was looking to be some of like 67 percent effective against asymptomatic infections um in in the clinical trial okay so so protection is is a gradient right so at one extreme of protection you've got sterilizing immunity um where you just don't get infected at all um and then next along that gradient would be some very truncated infection maybe just a couple of days that you don't notice and then um uh a longer gradient would be i think what people would generally be calling asymptomatic infection you know that you're infected for some period of time maybe even a week um but you never notice it you never felt sick you just you got a test for some reason and it turned out that test was positive and maybe of a substantial amount of virus but you want to getting sick right and and then next on the gradient are a really symptomatic COVID and then hospitalized COVID and ICU COVID right and then and then fatality and so protection is a gradient along immunological protection is a gradient along along that whole that whole spectrum um and protection against protection preventing asymptomatic infection is is probably indicating you've really got what we would call sterilizing immunity or just a really short asymptomatic infection of of a couple of days um and so if you have a vaccine that's giving you 95 percent protection against against symptomatic disease and let's just be simple and we'll call it 70 percent just to give a simple number um 70 percent against asymptomatic um that 70 percent protection is is probably it's sterilizing or very close to sterilizing okay so now you apply now if we apply a new viral variant to that picture and ask how's it going to do against a new viral variant and there are two general categories that we're trying to deal with right thinking about the viral variants is uh is it specifically evading a specific aspect of the immune system right that computerize it is it is it just the specific recognition that's being shifted or is it does it's just more virus in general that it's so it's tougher to protect against right so um so it's well I think we already talked about kind of a specific variant thing but the more virus in general so if you've got 70 percent sterilizing immunity and now you're faced with a new virus that has just more virus around uh you you're not going to have 70 percent sterilizing immunity anymore that's that's that's unlikely that's going to drop um uh some and and maybe uh and maybe a lot um but then there's still a pretty big window there on that on that gradient of protective immunity that you might not be able to you might no longer be stopping the virus from getting in and infecting you at all but once you get infected you have all these other weapons of the immune system right you've got the memory B cells you've got the the memory helper T cells memory killer T cells they're all then have an opportunity to try and shut down that virus within let's say five to seven days before it actually makes you sick so certainly you'd have less protection against infection at all but protection against symptomatic disease it might not drop very much because your immune system is an exponential process um and so and and these vaccines are inducing a lot of different components of of the immune system so given that there's a decent window of time before people show symptomatic disease um yeah the immune system might do a decent job at uh at dealing with variants even if it can't prevent infection present and again the the T cells are definitely recognizing all kinds of different parts of the virus so so we don't really expect variants matter at all for that and interestingly what we talk about variants escaping antibodies you know when you said well the point of memory B cells is to make more of those antibodies when you get infected so if you didn't have enough antibody at the start but once you get infected now you make more antibodies to try and stop the virus but uh that's actually only part of the story with memory B cells um and uh one of the cool things about memory B cells is your immune system makes a library of of memory B cells makes a range of memory B cells they don't all look the same um and and the the leading concept is that the memory B cells are a library of essentially guesses of what types of viral variants might occur so that if you do get infected well maybe you got infected because you just didn't quite have enough antibody but maybe you got infected because actually the virus looks a little different so the antibodies that you had circulating weren't the right ones but you have memory B cells that are that mutated themselves um and and and all looked a little bit different and so any memory B cells that can recognize the new variant that you've already got a lot of those and so it's still a lot better than starting uh uh from scratch so the variants are definitely a concern I mean if if nothing else they they're certainly infecting more people right and and certainly in the absence of of vaccines um uh the variants are gonna make more people sick and more people um uh will die because of these variants because they they are they are spreading more certainly they make it even more important uh to to wear a mask while and do social distancing well because I mean if if the virus is more transmissible and if there is more virus around it makes it all the more important uh to limit your exposure to it um but also to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible to limit the spread of the virus that based on all the available data we we we have that that still looks like the best path forward um and I don't know if you want to talk about the the ideas about uh changes in vaccines or whatnot yeah yeah definitely I mean that that's um I think you mentioned there's a bit of almost chaos um at at this time because the UK has a strategy with their vaccine that they've discussed at this time of trying to vaccinate really as many people as possible with one dose before coming around with the second dose for my understanding and uh some US officials have considered that strategy as well um so yeah what are your thoughts on that and then also this discussion uh again among officials of potentially giving out a half dose of these RNA vaccines as opposed to a full dose those are decisions being made or decisions being discussed and in some moment in the in in America that multiple different levels of government right because some of these decisions are it can even be made uh locally um and it is that there is there is some chaos uh on on on that topic right now um it's those decisions are largely being driven right now by given how bad the cases are can we can we save more lives and or blunt transmissions better by by doing something different with the vaccine and in in the UK really took the pretty extreme decision of of uh not following the vaccine uh schedule that that that was proven in the phase three trial um and there there are a couple of different ways that's being described and I think we'll have to kind of see how it how it plays out one simple notion was to say all right we're just just vaccinate everybody you can with one dose right now and and not really worry about when the second dose would be delivered and so if the second dose gets delivered at three weeks or four weeks or five weeks or six weeks fine that's probably all close enough to be pretty much the same um and it's just a logistics thing of trying to immunize as many people as possible as quickly as possible without knowing exactly when they'll get that that second immunization the booster immunization um and I think that's uh quite reasonable in the sense that uh whether someone gets that second immunization at three weeks four weeks five weeks six weeks or even at 12 weeks um their amount of protective immunity out at six months um is probably going to be the same independent of exactly which week they got immunized and there are certainly vaccination schedules and in experimental studies that have found delaying the immunization can be even better six months out you know that that that the way immune memory works having a delay in there can totally be beneficial none of that's been proven with these vaccines right but we know that these vaccines if you immunize at day zero and uh and day 21 or day 28 they work fantastically well 95 percent protection um it seems more with the UK is saying is immunize it day one and then week 12 with the idea that one immunization is good enough for protective immunity a lot of protective immunity probably for that 12 week period um and that's a real stretch um based on based on the available data which is which is which is why I refer to it as a pretty extreme uh decision certainly a decision one would not make in normal times when it only even considerate under sort of you know an emergency which is which is what they've which is what they've done as far as I can tell that decisions being based on two things one is that when one looks at the the Pfizer vaccine clinical trial data or the Moderna clinical trial site and the two companies have both reported these these data as well that that there is measurable protection after one immunization um and so that's that's interesting that's a good sign um and in fact that that 67 percent protection that I referred to right for the Moderna for the asymptomatic that that's all after one immunization because the way they found that was at the day of the second immunization they did a test and so any any of that protection was was occurring from the first immunization so by multiple metrics there's some protection after the first immunization there are two big questions one is how much does that protection how much is that protection and then how long does that protection last and the back of the envelope calculations that people have have done is that it's 90 percent protection uh or or more um but it's based on this really narrow window of time it's the time between that day one and then the day 21 or day 28 right that that's it because that's the only time window that was in those phase three clinical trials for having only one immunization but if you want it's a very good thing to test whether one immunization can be protected but the way you would do it is you would immunize some people with just one immunization and then you would just you would wait and watch right and and let it let it go the the six months that that wasn't done there's just like this couple week week period um to see an effect and that's not what the trials were designed to test and there wasn't follow up so I think it's entirely possible that that protection literally lasts for a couple of weeks and then it fades away um and and that would be your nightmare scenario that you've uh you've decided to immunize people 12 weeks apart and hope that they'd be protected for that period of time but instead they're just protected for a couple weeks of that um and you know and not the bulk of it and you really haven't gained yourself and what they're hoping for is that it is this 90 percent protection and then it stays something like that I think they've even had people say that they're hoping that maybe it's like 80 percent protection over that you know uh 12 weeks and then in the booster immunization kicks in and it goes up to 95 percent protection and there's just there's there's there's there's very little information to actually support that immunologically it's a reasonable concept but vaccines you know we hold vaccines to to a high bar of showing that they they they work so the American FDA responded to this yesterday with the press release that said you should not give these vaccines except for on the recommended schedule because there there isn't data supporting um just one immunization or spacing them out uh 12 weeks they did state look uh they they you know they said in in in their own way look if you get an immunization at day one and and can't manage to pull it off at four weeks and instead you know you had to delay it till six weeks sure go ahead and still give it at six weeks uh and that's a normal thing with any vaccine regimen if you're if you're a little early or or a couple weeks late um that's that that's all fine but betting that one immunization is providing a lot of of protection really isn't warranted from from the data that are are available for for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and and and and and Pfizer and Moderna right have both said well we I mean they've said very little right but one of the things essentially well we ran these phase three clinical trials to show that the vaccine would work if you take it the way we say you should take it uh beyond that uh there there's there's not a lot uh uh uh to go on so then the other consider the other idea that that's that's been floated in the US was well okay and instead of that what if you go with a half dose so instead of uh you give the vaccine on the same time frame but you go with a half dose um and at least for the Moderna vaccine they did have a clinical trial where they gave people half dose um and the immune responses and the people who got the half dose um were about the same as the immune responses and people who got the whole dose so from an immunogenicity perspective um that that concept is is supported um but that wasn't a phase three clinical trial that wasn't a that wasn't a clinical trial that tested protection that was a clinical trial that just tested immunogenicity did people make an immune response so there's no direct demonstration that the half dose protects people um it's a reasonable inference that it would protect people because it was basically the same immune response um over over a short window of time um but the normal bar we hold vaccines do is is you know show that it actually works in a in a phase three even for for emergency use um and it's possible if the half dose wouldn't generate you know as much memory as the photos uh that being said the half dose was given to several hundred people um so it was a pretty big study and it really did look not inferior to to the photos so if somebody told me that under an emergency situation that they were just gonna change it and everybody was gonna get a half dose because it was important to immunize twice as many people um i could certainly understand that decision process because uh there's no safety concern with it and you've got immunogenicity data to at least support that that you would expect a reasonable amount of protection but honestly at the moment it's looked like the biggest problems at least in the US are are not actually the available doses but just the logistics of immunizing people right that that in California is something like only 35 percent of the doses have been given so the problem isn't that we need to space them out or give half a dose we just got to use the doses that are there so i i certainly don't mind people having conversations about changing vaccine dose or regimen but uh uh trust in the vaccines is a very important aspect as well you know and and these two vaccines have like 95 percent efficacy if you give them properly so you know really uh i'm with the FDA that you should give the vaccines properly and you should give them a lot faster than we're giving them right now and and and that's the best path that's the best fast forward for for January you mentioned that a potential downside of either giving a half dose or just one dose as opposed to two is that maybe you don't have the same immunity that was demonstrated in this clinical trials are there other downsides of you know again doing something like the UK is considering doing with just the one dose and spacing out that second dose could it put uh a different type of pressure on this virus to mutate is that another potential yeah it really yeah it is yeah i mean my PhD is in is in virology so i definitely think about a bunch of these things sort of from the virus perspective from time to time and and i very much agree with comments that i've seen people put out and i've made similar comments in private that but gee if you really wanted to drive virus escape mutations you would do it in a partially immune population so that there was some immunity around but not enough to squish the virus just enough to to injure it but give it time and opportunity to mutate and become become resistant you know that's i mean that's basically the the old recipe for how you get antibiotic resistant bacteria and certainly in labs that's exactly what you do to get resistant viruses to drugs to study you know how viruses evolve you don't you don't want situations with low grade immunity you you want the maximum immunity you can get and just and crush the virus so that you know that it stops and the virus has no chance to escape so yeah i am very much in agreement that that's that's a concern which is also my opinion on on convalescent plasma treatments i really don't see any reason why anybody should be using convalescent plasma in patients at this point there they're monoclonal antibody treatments that are highly potent and so you either give those or or nothing at all i would say because the convalescent plasma has this really low antibody tighter and and as far as i think it though they really don't work in people so if anything you're just giving a bit of antibody into a person that has a ton of virus and you're potentially just driving escape mutations in in these peaceful you're you're you're turning them into you know virus mutation experiments which is really not what anybody needs yeah i mean that's that's a concern that that's sort of one way that the UK variant could have emerged basically is that it was a virus that was growing in an immunocompromised person for for a long period of time so it's just a person who had a lot of virus for a long time and that in some sort of partial immunity well professor karate thanks again for joining us today and again i hope everyone will go back and watch our previous discussion a lot was said there about how these RNA vaccines work and what's what's next for you and your team professor i clearly there's still a lot more to learn about about immune memory and to the virus and so we're going to we're going to keep studying immune memory and and directly studying the immune responses people make to to these vaccines because this yeah this virus is not it's not going to go away overnight and i will say broadly on the horizon beyond beyond just us i think there is another vaccine trial right that's that's expected to have results this next month and so people are very interested in that one and that's the J&J clinical trial which is another adenoviral and so that's yeah something to keep an eye out for excellent well thanks again for joining us appreciate it thanks Kyle"
"COVID 19 Vaccine Deep Dive: Safety, Immunity, RNA Production, (Pfizer Vaccine / Moderna Vaccine)",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-12-16,eK0C5tFHze8,"Professor Crottie, the research from you and your team that's been featured in the New York Times, and has been recently held up by Dr. Fauci at a congressional hearing, has been key to our understanding about how our immune system reacts to this new coronavirus and its implications for vaccines. I've gathered a lot of questions from our viewers about immunity and vaccines, including the basic question, how safe are mRNA vaccines? But before we get to those questions, can you briefly explain your most recent research about SARS-CoV-2? Sure. The most recent was to ask, essentially, do people have immune memory to this virus or not, and what does that memory look like? An immune memory really is a lot like brain memory. It's, you've seen something before, and your immune system has figured out how to recognize it and remember it. It's really one of three major parts that you've got antibodies, then you've got helper T cells, and you've got killer T cells. And the simple way to think about those is, antibodies are really good at stopping a virus outside of cells, but once a virus has infected the cells, then you really need T cells. T cells are specialized for dealing with infected cells. And antibodies get made by B cells. And so in terms of memory, you've really got memory B cells that can make the antibodies. You've got the antibodies that are actually circulating in your blood, and then you've got these two kinds of T cells that can either kill cells or have other jobs. And so what we did was to ask, in people who had had COVID-19, do they have these four kinds of memory and some subflavours of those? How much of that and how long did it last? And the quick answer was, essentially like 95 percent of people at six to eight months post-infection really had a robust amount of immune memory based on these measurements we did. And this is the largest study of immune memory ever in people to actually measure all of the different parts of immune memory. So it was, it was a lot of work. But the results were pretty interesting that people's immune system do tend to be remembering this virus pretty well. So that was our recent study. SARS-CoV-2 is made up of, what is it, 25 or 28 major proteins? And the scientists at Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna have isolated the messenger RNA for just the spike protein. Is that correct? Is spike protein made up of one protein or of multiple proteins? It's one protein. So it's a it's a it's a trimmer. So it ends up being three copies of the same protein. So it's all encoded by one RNA. It's the same same sequence just three folded together three times. Got it. Why did both companies choose to use spike protein for their target for this vaccine? Right. So there are about 29 licensed human vaccines, depending on how you count, and almost all of them work on the basis of protective antibody responses. And so when you're trying to move fast with with vaccine development, the most obvious target is to try and make antibodies against the protein that's on the surface of the virus. Because antibodies work by by binding to the surface of a virus and essentially covering the virus and keeping the virus from from doing anything. That's really the simple way to think about antibodies working. And so for previous coronaviruses, it was known that there are a couple of different proteins on the surface of the virus. But it's really the spike protein that's the major one and probably the most important antibody target. And sure enough, in the month subsequent to to those decisions, lots of data have accumulated that have said essentially all of the neutralizing antibodies, the important antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are against the spike protein. So the spike protein is the best target to focus on for for antibodies. And when I talked to you about, you know, they're really being three parts of the immune system, one of the concerns has been that, well, sometimes antibodies aren't that great at stopping all viruses. And then you really need the T-cells to kick in. And the T-cells don't necessarily recognize spike. They might recognize some of those other 25 proteins. And so that was actually our first major scientific study on COVID-19 was to ask and infected people. Do people make T-cells that recognize spike also or only other proteins? And what we found was that it infected people, actually people make a lot of T-cell responses to spike also. And so that was a really that was a good sign supporting the vaccine development at all. That if you if you are some some viruses, you have to choose more than one protein. For this virus, it's looked like, yeah, just choosing one protein is a is a reasonable way to try and get antibody responses and T-cell responses. Along those lines, if this virus mutated, well, we know it's mutating all the time. But if there was a mutation, I guess is it possible that there's a mutation where this virus could infect and cause harm without the spike protein? No, not without the spike protein. The the questions really about whether, you know, if this is the spike protein, can it mutate the spike protein? So it looks a little bit different. And now antibodies are recognizing the three-dimensional structure. They're physically binding. It's sort of like, well, I mean, it's like anything. It's like, you know, it's like my mouse, right? And it's like, well, maybe the antibodies are really recognizing this little knobby wheel. And if they're just recognizing that and the virus mutates that, well, now you're in trouble because you're not seeing the other parts of it. And so that's something people have been spending a lot of attention to where exactly are those virus mutations. And then where are the antibody responses people are making? And viruses behave different ways. So so flu is a really big problem in that way where flu is clearly able to mutate. But lots of other viruses aren't. So like measles, there's been a measles vaccine for what 70 years now. And the virus has never managed to mutate away from that. And same thing with polio and hepatitis B. And so far it looks like 95 percent of people still had antibodies that neutralize that virus very well. And that's probably because every single person's making multiple different antibodies. So even if the virus has one mutation, that doesn't escape because it's only escaping one little part of the immune response. The scientists have been able to isolate this one strand of mRNA that just codes for the spike protein. And then they packaged it into what are called lipid nanoparticles. Is that is that correct? Yes, that's correct. Basically just little fat droplets, if you will, right? Very small microscopic fat droplets. Super tiny butter droplets. Yeah. They're talking about it. So why why do they package it that way? And also how do they package that way? They have this mRNA. How do they get it into the lipid nanoparticle? Yeah. So and so I think for that, we also need to deal with just what is RNA and why is an RNA vaccine a reasonable approach? So RNA is a really common molecule in your body. Essentially, all living things use RNA as messages and those messages in code within a cell at any one of your cells at any given time, you've got like 5,000 different RNAs. And in those RNAs are each encoding different messages that tell the cells to do different things, make different proteins. And in RNAs are made to be transient. So they're really a lot like it's like 5,000 post-it notes and they'll be around for minutes or hours and then they get shredded up and they're gone. They're temporary. And so an RNA vaccine is same thing. It's a temporary message, but it has to get into the cell. And so if it's in the cell, the cell will now read that message and do it the message says, which helps then instruct the immune system. And then the message goes away. So RNA are these temporary messages or like Snapchat messages was the other analogy that I've used. There's a message and then it expires. Technologically, one of the big challenges there is that RNA is temporary, it gets shredded up really easily. Again, just shredding up a post-it note. And so you got to get it into the cells without it all getting shredded up. So if you just inject RNA from a syringe into somebody's skin, it doesn't get into the cells. So the trick that people figured out over the past 10 years was, oh, you can put it in these little, these little butter droplets. And the little droplets will basically fuse with the cells and release the RNA into the cells. So now you've got the messages now made it into the cell or it needs to be read. And then it can be shredded up afterwards. So it's a delivery system to get the RNA into the cells. The lipid nanoparticle that's taken this mRNA vaccine, what cells in our body does it actually go into? Is it just muscle cells in our arm where we get the injection? Yeah, it's a good question. So it definitely goes into muscle cells. And I think in scientists, they're still learning which cells are the important cells, basically. Most of the cells that are getting the RNA are the muscle cells. And it's possible that specialized cells in the immune system that aren't very common, but they may get the RNA. And those may be the more important for starting the immune response. Yeah, most of the RNA is going into the muscle cells. And I'm sure the protein expression there matters. It's just that that might not be the only cell type that matters. A question that a lot of people have had is once that mRNA gets into our cells and codes for that spike protein, does it just code does each strand of mRNA just code for one spike protein and then does the the post-it note or the mRNA get destroyed or dissolve or does it code for multiple proteins and last for maybe an hour or a day, like how long does the mRNA from this vaccine actually last in our cells, approximately? Yeah, so good question. So the RNA gets read multiple times. So it'll just keep it gets read over and over and over again so that you make a lot of the spike protein, which will then get expressed on the surface of the cell to stimulate the immune system. And I'd say average RNAs in your cell will last some generally minutes to hours, but some of them will last a day or more. And these the RNA vaccines are engineered to be stable. And so the information I've seen is that they'll last a couple of days. So we have the mRNA inside of a lipid nanoparticle. What else goes in in the vaccine? Obviously it's got to be some type of saline solution or something. Right, that's it. It's basically just delivered in some essentially as some saltwater set to match the the saltiness of your own body so it's essentially as natural as possible. It seems like a question that a lot of people have with vaccines in general. Okay, well what else do they put in on them? And from my understanding with this Pfizer, BioNTech vaccine, they came out and said we didn't put any adjuvants or preservatives in this particular vaccine. Why are adjuvants used sometimes in vaccines? Yeah, that's a great question. So essentially usually adjuvants are used and it goes back to what I said about immune memory at the beginning. You know your immune system. Remember, some things really well and remembers other things really poorly. And there are complexities there, but the rule of thumb is that the bigger the threat than the bigger the memory. It's a lot like, you know, you might not be able to remember what socks you put on two days ago. But if if you were almost in a car accident at some particular intersection, you're going to remember that intersection for a very long time, right? Because it was a it was a memorable event. And so vaccines have to deal with the same thing that the immune system's good at ignoring things that aren't very threatening. And so adjuvants are a way of providing the immune system a stimulation that says, hey, this thing that you're about to see, this is a potential threat and you should make a substantial immune response to it and remember it. And so that's if you just inject a protein by itself, that proteins inert, it's non-threatening, it's not replicating. It's not going to do anything to you. And so the adjuvant is the immune stimulus to get you going. And RNA of X-Tene essentially ends up in coding its own its own stimulation. So it accomplishes that on its own. The lipid nanoparticles done its job, it's brought the mRNA into the cell. And now it's the ribosomes job to actually code or basically essentially build a protein out of that right. So what your immune system ends up needing to see in the end are proteins because that's what the virus itself is made out of proteins. The spike proteins are on the surface of the virus and it's those proteins that an antibody or T cells would recognize. And your cells are making proteins all the time as instructed by RNA messages. So now instead they're going to make these viral spike proteins and that's what the immune system will start recognizing. And that does get triggered by just the normal protein synthesis machinery in the cells, which are the ribosomes and the amino acids already in your cells. Why not just skip a step and use a vaccine that uses the spike protein itself? Why go through the sector step of the RNA? Right, that's a really good question. So in one of the classic ways to make a vaccine is to have the vaccine be the protein, be the viral spike protein or be a viral manaparticle. And there are vaccines that work fantastically well that way. And some of the original vaccines going back to the early 20th century are that way that the tetanus vaccine and diphtheria vaccine, which are incredibly successful. And in fact some of the COVID-19 vaccines currently being worked on are protein vaccines. And there's a reasonable chance those will succeed as vaccines. A downside to protein vaccines is that you have to manufacture the protein and the manufacturing process for any given protein is its own unique manufacturing problem. And so in terms of just a physical production problem, you've got to solve that production problem. And since that's unique, the FDA has to basically review every step of it and agree that everything is fine about that. And viral proteins tend to be kind of unusual proteins. They're not super simple to manufacture. So it can take some time and energy to figure out how to solve that basically manufacturing problem, that biochemistry protein synthesis problem. The RNA vaccines bypass that problem because the manufacturing process is always the same. The RNA encodes a different sequence, but molecularly it's the same manufacturing process. And so FDA approval and whatnot is all really fast because it just looks the same from a manufacturing standpoint. So that's why the RNA vaccines have gone through phase one phase two phase three trials so fast and gotten FDA approval so quick is because they were very fast to manufacture and very fast to approve because it's largely once they solve the problem once it's plug and play. So along those lines, do you think this is really the future of vaccine development using this type of technology? I mean, the results are incredibly encouraging, right? I mean, this is the first time ever in human history. There's been a vaccine developed within a calendar year and not only that now it's actually been three, right? There have been three successful phase three clinical trials within a single calendar that that's never happened for anything. So those are phenomenal successes in the RNA vaccine showing 95 percent efficacy and fantastic efficacy in the elderly and fantastic efficacy against severe disease. I mean, those are those are huge wins in in RNA vaccines are definitely going to be successful solutions again in the future. I think they're likely to still be part of the vaccine toolbox. I don't think they'll solve every problem. There are some things that I think they're they're good at and there are other things that that other vaccine technologies may be better at. But in terms of speed, I mean, nothing can match this. I mean, vaccine development classically is frequently a 20 year process, right? Or let's say a 10 year process. And instead, you're talking about a 10 month process, not only a 10 month process, but a 10 month process that really involved a huge amount of safety data and one. I mean, you know, 70,000 doses being given and tested to validate both the efficacy and the safety that clearly RNA vaccines have a very promising future from my understanding. mRNA does its work just in the cytoplasm of ourselves. Is that correct? That's correct. So yeah, I've gotten lots of questions about, well, wait, isn't this genetic engineering? I don't want to be genetically engineered. Am I go fair enough? I don't want to be genetically engineered either. But this is RNA. It's just messages. They're transient temporary. They don't become part of your body. It's just not the same thing as DNA. Now, what about, speaking of DNA, the AstraZeneca vaccine candidate that utilizes DNA? Yeah. So, and so both the AstraZeneca approach and Johnson and Johnson approach use a viral vector. And it is a viral vector that contains DNA, but really it's about the virus. So they're using a different virus and adenovirus as a delivery system into your cells, essentially, you know, sort of like giving you one viral infection to teach your immune system how to fight another viral infection. That's also transient DNA. That doesn't become part of your DNA. That's just the viruses DNA. And those viral vectors, they've been gutted so that they can't become another adenovirus. It's like taking a car and taking out the engine, you know, and even taking out the seats. It still looks like a car from the outside and you can put some new stuff in it and you're sort of showing that to the immune system to do what something looks like. But it's not going to go drive off on its own or anything. Got it. Okay. So going back to our kind of step-by-step process, we have the mRNA, the ribosome, then codes for a spike protein. Does that spike protein then get released from our cells? Does it get expressed on the surface of our cells or both? Both. Predominantly, it's getting expressed on the surface of the cells. And that's just, that's where, well, that's a good way for it to be shown to the immune system, basically. So it gets shown to the immune system and then what happens? So a thousand different things. One immune response is a really complicated orchestrated dance. But essentially, you have in your body right now parts of your adaptive immune system that can potentially recognize any possible virus that would ever exist. But to do that, you have billions of cells that are all really rare. So it's basically there's like a one-and-a-million cell somewhere that could actually make the antibodies that would recognize the virus that would stop it and same thing with the T cells. So what has to happen is those very rare cells have to be exposed to this new protein. And then since those cells are so rare, they're not very useful when they're, you know, one-and-a-million, one-and-a-billion cells in your body. So those cells have to grow and divide and multiply until there are millions of them and that takes time. And that's one of the big goals of a vaccine is to really the whole point of a vaccine is to show your immune system what the virus looks like before you're infected so that your immune system can go through that learning process and that growth process on its own, on your immune system's own time and get you to a point where now, okay, you've got the antibodies and you've got the T cells and you're going to have that immune memory all before you ever get exposed to the virus. So normally when you get exposed to the virus, the virus gets the head start, okay? And then your immune system is playing ketchup. Your immune system has these rare cells that can potentially protect you, but they're rare. And they have to grow from one cell into a million cells and usually that takes a week and you get sick for that week in the meantime. So you talked about this cascade of immune system effects and response to either a vaccine or a natural infection. With a vaccine, what symptoms would you expect when the immune system is really ramping up and responding? Yeah, that's another good question and I get it a lot and yeah, I definitely tell people these vaccines are safe. That doesn't mean they're not going to make it not feel so great for a day or two or have a little bit of a fever and that can be a really positive thing because essentially this goes back to your immune system is really designed to remember things that were something of a threat. And so you really do have to earn your immunity. A lot like going to the gym and working out, if you get really sore, that can really be a positive sign. Same kind of thing for a vaccine. If you've got some swelling, if you've got some redness, if you've got a little bit of a fever, those are basically all straightforward signs that your immune system is working, is doing its job of recognizing that vaccine and building building the tools and weapons to fight the virus if they see it. And usually for most vaccines that can go on for one day, two days, three days and that's been what people have been seeing with these RNA vaccines as well. Most people get a bit of redness and a bit of sordidness and some people get a real fever for a day and that's honestly just a positive sign that your immune system is fighting it. So, I mean side effect is almost the wrong terminology for that. It's really kind of an expected immunogenic response. Exactly. And that's why it's important to recognize that safety is really important for vaccines because vaccines are given to healthy people. And that's always been a key feature of vaccines is paying a lot of attention to safety. But that's different than what we're talking about here of getting sore or feeling a bit tired. Those can be essentially on target effects. Signs that you mean signs of the vaccine is really working. The guidance from the FDA and the CDC with the Pfizer, BioNTech vaccine is that even people have had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection should get the vaccine. I think a lot of people were initially confused by this. Why do you think they made that recommendation? Yeah, it's a good question and it's because we don't like as of today and certainly as of a couple weeks ago, we don't have a good grasp of how long does protective immunity last after you've been after you've had COVID-19. And we also don't know how long it last after the vaccines. But so far, the vaccines are looking good. In our data, when we looked at immune memory in people, right, we were saying something like 95 percent of people had what we consider immune memory that looks good. But that still doesn't prove that those people are going to have protective immunity. Really, you have to have bigger, longer studies to wait and see, you know, how long are people protected? And so, yeah, I think the vaccine recommendation is the right one. If we knew for sure that catching COVID-19 really did give you protective immunity for a long time, then I think the vaccine recommendation would be no, don't bother. But as it stands right now, we don't know that. And so it makes sense to still recommend getting getting the vaccine. And is it possible that the vaccine can actually give longer immunity than a natural infection to start getting? It's possible. There are definitely vaccines that do that. So the papilloma virus vaccine is a fantastic example of a vaccine where the vaccine works way better than natural infection at generating protective immunity and long lasting immunity. The opposite also occurs. I mean, the normal flu vaccine really gives pretty short-lived immunity. But if you actually catch the flu, your immunity to that flu is really quite, quite long lasting. So it can go both ways. And since RNA vaccines are new, we don't have a historical reference point for comparison. So far, the data with the RNA vaccines has been fantastic. And really, the big unanswered question with them at this point is durability. How long are they going to last? And right now, we don't know how long durability is going to last for the vaccine, compared to having had the infection. The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccines are very similar. Why does the Pfizer vaccine need to be stored at negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit when the Moderna vaccine just needs regular refrigeration? As pretty cold, right? Well, I think the Moderna one requires the very cold for long-term storage, but for a shorter term, it can do better. And in fact, there are other RNA vaccine formulations that have been published later in 2020 that could actually do room temperature storage. It comes down to the nature, the precise nature of those lipid nanoparticles and how stable they are. I'm going to put you on the spot here, Professor Crottie. If you had a family member or a close friend, say to you, you know, Professor, you've studied vaccines in immunity, your entire career. This vaccine looks promising, but it, you know, as you mentioned, the timeline has been so much shorter than what we're used to with vaccines. And it's using a new technology, this RNA technology. Should I be nervous about this? What would you say? Yeah, great question. And the answer is no, don't be nervous. Definitely get vaccinated if you can get vaccinated. I mean, obviously, for one, right now, the COVID-19 threat in the population is horrible, right? I mean, we've crossed thresholds of like 3,000 deaths a day in the country. I mean, those are, it's a really bad situation. And on the flip side, these vaccines are, you know, 95 percent effective. That in two totally independent trials of huge numbers of people, that data is really strong. These vaccines definitely work. And yeah, I certainly get questions about safety, which are reasonable questions to ask. Again, because he said, because of the speed. And so there are two parts of it. One is you would be really hard pressed to find any medicine that has had this much safety data already by the time it becomes publicly available. Again, 70,000 people have already gotten the vaccine and been tracked for safety. That's a huge amount of safety data way more than most medicines get when they come to market. So, I mean, those are, in the reason for accumulating all that was actually because of speed, that's actually fine results quick enough. They had to have a huge number of people involved in the study. And so as a result, they got a ton of safety data. And they've also got safety data going, you know, for essentially six months from the earlier clinical trials they got started in the summer. Really the best way to think about the speed of development is one, this is a technology that could move very fast through manufacturing. And that's really where a lot of the speed came from was manufacturing. The safety part of it is the same amount of time as it basically always takes. And the other thing that's been fast about it has been problems that money could solve. So normally for developing a vaccine, somebody goes to a phase one trial and then waits and then goes to a phase trial and waits and then goes to a phase three. They don't invest a huge amount of money up front because there's a good chance that they would lose that money. And instead in this situation, right, going back to March, companies, governments and non-government organizations were all saying, okay, invest the billion dollars up front, you know, and sure we may lose that money. But if it works, we'll have a vaccine, you know, a year faster than we otherwise would because we're just paying for the manufacturing to get going up front. That's just a money, that's just the problem money can solve. You can just be losing that money in the end, but you're not taking any shortcuts. You're just starting the process a lot earlier than you would otherwise. And sure enough, things worked out incredibly well, right? And these vaccines are actually working. And so now they're already vaccine doses being delivered, instead of the companies now starting to manufacture them and then being delivered, you know, six months and more later. And as you mentioned, there's good data and there's a lot of data about safety in the short term. What about long term potential side effects? I know that's another concern of the problem. And that was one of the main ones that the FDA wanted to consider as well. And so basically they did a review of vaccine literature and said, yeah, in the past for all these other vaccines, any important vaccine safety signature was clear within two months. And so that's why the FDA specifically demanded that there be two full months of safety data on these large trials, and that that's what's being reviewed by the FDA. And they've, yeah, they've looked fine. So in other words, if based on the extensive history we have with vaccines, if you don't see a safety concern in the first two months of use of the vaccine, it's unlikely to see long term side effects down the road from it. Yeah. That's exactly right. Well, Professor Crottie, thanks so much for joining us today. We really appreciate it. And briefly any next projects that you and your team there at the lab are focusing on? Yeah. So I mean here at the Wilhoi Institute for Immunology, we're one of the best places in the world studying the immune system. And we can actually look at all these different immune responses to COVID-19 at the same time, which most places can't. So we're continuing to examine that both to try and understand acute disease you know why people end up in the hospital as well as immune immune memory to this virus. And it's yeah, it's a lot of work, but it's important to those of the problems we keep trying to solve. Well, thanks so much for your time and all your research and work. We really appreciate it. Yeah, thanks Kyle."
Coronavirus Update 119: Pfizer BioNTech COVID Vaccine (Clinical Considerations),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-12-14,mOmtZ_p6alU,"Cram.com. Welcome to another May Cram COVID-19 update. Daily new cases in the United States are at an all-time high. And if we look at the daily new deaths in the United States, the rate seems to be consistently increasing at least at this point. So as this is being recorded, we have the advisory group at the FDA giving the green light, the FDA giving the green light, and now finally the CDC green lighting, the decision to recommend the Pfizer vaccine for use. So as it stands, there really isn't any further regulatory decisions that have to be made. The vaccines have already been shipped, and they are arriving at facilities for distribution. There were a number of questions from some of you about this vaccine in terms of practical things, like who gets it, who shouldn't get it, for instance, pregnancy. What happens if you've had COVID-19 in the past? What happens if you've had plasma, for instance, in the past? What are some of the issues that are raised with that? And the purpose of this video is to go over those questions and see if we can answer those. So the source of a lot of the answers to these questions that I've been getting is from a clinical considerations slide set from the CDC. And we'll put a link to that slide set in the description below. But before we answer those questions, I wanted to make you aware of an interesting website here on the New York Times. So as many of you know, the vaccine is going to first go to healthcare providers and those that are at risk, for instance, nursing homes, etc. And if you want to know how long it's going to be before you have the opportunity to get this type of vaccine, you can simply go to this website and read a little bit of an article about it. You can put in your age what county you live in. And if you're one of these professions, like I've done here, or whether or not you have these COVID-related health risks, and simply submit it. And what they'll do is they'll tell you a little bit of information based on the information you've given it. And they'll show you here at the front of the line who gets the first vaccine. And then where you might be in line based on the answers that you've submitted. But the final say is actually with the state governments, there is some variability. And this New York Times article actually takes that into consideration when you plug in which county you live in. And of course, we'll put a link in the description below. So this is a two injection vaccination. After the first shot is given, you have 17 to 21 days to get the second shot. If you happen to go past 21 days, you need to get the second injection as soon as possible. In that situation, you do not need to repeat the first dose. You just get the second shot. And remember that we really don't know how effective this vaccine is with just one shot. So you really do need to get the second shot. Now in case you were thinking of maybe getting a different vaccine for your second shot, it's not interchangeable with other COVID-19 vaccinations. So you need to complete the second shot with the same product. In this case, it's the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine. Now currently the authorities are saying if somebody were to get a second shot, that was a different vaccine, then there's no recommendation at this point to get a second of one of those vaccinations. It would not be the ideal situation, but at this time, they're saying that you would not need to get a third vaccination. Okay, what about if somebody has a previous infection with COVID-19? So what currently they're saying is regardless of whether or not you've had a previous infection, whether or not you had severe COVID or even asymptomatic COVID, but you found out later that you were positive, they're still recommending that you get the vaccination. You do not need to get a COVID-19 test, either a PCR or an antigen test, and you do not need to get antibody tests to see whether or not you can get the vaccine. Okay, well, what happens if you have a current infection? If you have a current infection with COVID-19, you should not get the vaccination. You should wait at least 14 days after the infection and you're done with isolation before considering getting the vaccination. Now as a caveat, current evidence is suggesting that re-infection, while it can happen, is not common within 90 days after the initial infection. So if you wanted to defer vaccination until the end of the 90-day period after your first infection, you could do that if you so desired. Okay, well, what happens if you got previous antibody or plasma therapy from a previous infection? Well, we actually don't know. We don't have any data on this vaccine in people who have received antibody, monoclotal antibody or plasma treatment for COVID-19 in the past. And so it's potentially advisable to wait again 90 days after you received any kind of plasma or antibody therapy to make sure that those antibodies are out of the system before getting the vaccination. Okay, what happens if you have underlying medical conditions? So long as you don't have any contraindications to the vaccination like allergies, et cetera, there seems to be similar safety and efficacy in the phase two and three trials in the Pfizer Biontech vaccine for people with underlying medical conditions. So that's a go. And by the way, these medical conditions also include immunocompromised patients. Those are patients with HIV or other immunocompromised medical conditions. But also remember that patients with those kind of conditions with HIV or immunocompromised conditions should be counseled that there's no real available data to establish the safety or efficacy of the vaccine in these groups, but they're not excluding them at this point. All right, what about pregnancy? A couple of things that you need to know. First of all, we have no data on safety or efficacy in pregnancy. But you should know that studies are ongoing. It looks as though we will have some data because there were some people in the vaccine arm of the trial that did get pregnant. So that data should be forthcoming shortly. You should know that generally speaking, we don't like to give live vaccines in pregnancy. And the good news is that this Pfizer Biontech vaccine is not a live virus. And they do not enter the nucleus of the cell. They do not change your DNA. On the flip side, you should know that we are finding out that patients who are pregnant seem to have a worse course of COVID. And there has been noted in research increase risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes like preterm birth. Currently, what they're recommending is that if a woman who is pregnant is pregnant, is part of a group that is recommended to be vaccinated as the timeline goes on, that it is okay if a pregnant woman is part of that group, she can be vaccinated if she so chooses. What they're recommending is that there be a discussion with the pregnant woman in terms of recommendation to make an informed decision of the risk of contracting COVID-19 during pregnancy versus efficacy and side effects of the vaccine. If a pregnant woman decides to take the COVID-19 vaccine and she develops a post injection fever, the recommendation is to take acetaminophen due to fever being associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. And currently they're recommending against routine testing for pregnancy. And they're recommended to take a vaccine and they're recommended to take a vaccine. And currently they're recommending against routine testing for pregnancy in childbearing age women before giving a COVID-19 vaccine. What about if you're breastfeeding? There is no safety data with COVID-19 vaccine or effect of mRNA vaccines on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Again, this is an mRNA vaccine and not thought to be a risk factor for the breastfeeding infant. And what they're currently recommending is if a lactating woman is part of a group like a healthcare worker that has been recommended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, she may be vaccinated if she so chooses. So if you do get the vaccine and it's a week after your second shot, do you still wear masks and do social distancing and wash your hands? Hopefully you're still washing your hands. The answer is yes, you still need to do that until we reach herd immunity. Or until we have data that shows that this Pfizer biontact vaccine actually can stop transmission. My understanding is that they're going to be looking at blood samples in the study and we should have some data next month or in February about whether or not this vaccine is able to stop transmission. Currently at this point, all we know is that this vaccine is very effective at preventing COVID-19 disease and it's about 95 percent able to do that. There's no vaccine that's 100 percent effective. Remember that something that's very common is post vaccine side effects that are expected. So that would be like pain at the injection site or you might have within the next 24 hours, fevers or chills or muscle aches. That's to be expected because it is stimulating your immune system to have an immune response against the vaccine. So another term for this is reactogenicity. It's basically telling you that your body is doing what it needs to do. It's creating an immune response. And if you get that on the first shot, expect to get that on the second shot as well. It may even be more intense on the second shot. You should also know that medications for reducing fever or for analgesia is okay to take in these post vaccination symptoms. Medications like Tylenol or NSAIDs. They're saying is you can use that if you have issues with fever or pain, but that routine prophylaxis with antipyretic or analgesic medication is not recommended due to a lack of information on the impact of use on vaccine induced antibody responses. So only use if needed. Now what about the flu shot? Obviously we're during the flu season. And so what are the recommendations in terms of giving the COVID-19 vaccine with the flu shot? And what they're saying is that the COVID-19 vaccine should be administered with a minimum interval of 14 days, either before or after administration with any other vaccine. And that includes the flu shot. So you really shouldn't have it so that either the first shot or the second shot of the Pfizer biotech COVID-19 vaccine within 14 days of the flu shot. And as we said, the second shot should be given between 17 and 21 days after the first shot. If it's more than three weeks, it's okay. It's not ideal. It will still be considered a complete vaccination schedule. What about tests? Suppose that you want to get on a plane and you want to fly, let's say to Hawaii and you want to make sure that you don't get tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 because you got a vaccination. The good news is the Pfizer biotech COVID-19 vaccine will not affect the results of a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test otherwise known as a PCR test or antigen test. So that's good news. If you want to check antibodies, however, and of course this vaccine induces both a humoral, which is antibody response and also a T cell response. Remember that the Pfizer biotech vaccine mRNA codes for the spike protein. And so if the antibody that you're testing for is against the spike protein and it's positive after the vaccination, you won't be able to tell whether or not that positive antibody was a result of a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test. So that's a result of vaccination or a previous infection with COVID-19. Now because the mRNA vaccine codes for the spike protein, that's the vaccination that if you make an antibody against the nucleocapsid protein. Since the Pfizer biotech vaccine mRNA does not code for the nucleocapsid protein, which is another portion of the virus. And if you are positive for that, then you can say it's not from the vaccination, but you actually had an infection with COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2. So in other words, after you get the vaccination, it's going to be important to let people know that you have been vaccinated and that if they want to check to see whether or not you've actually been infected with the virus itself, they should be checking the nucleocapsid protein antibody. Now if you receive the Pfizer biotech vaccine and there's an adverse event, make sure you tell the administering organization that there has been an adverse event and they will report it to the vaccine adverse event reporting system so that Pfizer will know that something has happened and they can investigate. That answers a lot of the questions that I have been receiving regarding this Pfizer vaccine that is coming out. We will put the references to these questions in the description below. I want to thank everybody for the wonderful feedback from the vitamin D video that we published a couple of days ago. If you haven't seen it, please watch it. Be safe and thanks for joining us. You"
"Coronavirus Update 118: AstraZeneca DNA COVID 19 Vaccine Explained (vs. Pfizer / BioNTech, Moderna)",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-11-24,GOq8-FR8s1E,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. And we're going to be talking about the AstraZeneca vaccine in this update. But first, let's take a look at the numbers real quick. Daily new cases in the United States are at an all-time high. But it may be peaking. We don't know. We'll need to get some more data here. But if you look at the data, you can see that there has been somewhat of a slowdown in the number of cases. Of course, with deaths, they lag behind maybe a couple to three weeks. And the daily new deaths are increasing as well. At this point, again, we're going to have to wait for further data. So now we're going to talk about the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine. And we're going to compare in contrast to the ones that have gone before it, like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine. Now, as you will recall, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine are based on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Are basically new vaccines in the sense that they are injecting messenger RNA into your cells to tell the cells to produce the protein that is the same as a portion of the spike protein on the virus. And that is what generates the immune response. So in other words, we're giving instructions to the cell to make the form protein which causes the immune response. And that is actually very similar to the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, except instead of using messenger RNA. They're using DNA to do that. So once again, in terms of a picture, imagine we have the cell and we've got the nucleus. And what we were doing before was we were taking messenger RNA. And that messenger RNA was being translated by ribosomes and converted into the protein. And what we did with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine is we were getting the messenger RNA into the cytoplasm of the cell. The cytoplasm is the outside portion, as opposed to the nucleus. How do we get that messenger RNA in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine in? Well, we used a lipid bilayer or a micelle, as we called it, to get those fragments or that messenger RNA into the cytoplasm. And then from there, it's fairly straightforward. The cell uses its own cell machinery, which is the ribosomes to cause translation to occur and you make the protein in question. How this is different is AstraZeneca uses a different technique. And it uses a virus called an adenovirus. But not a human one, but a chimpanzee. Now, why would it do that? Chimpanzee adenoviruses have not really been exposed to the human population. And so it's very unlikely that humans would create an immune response against the adenovirus specifically itself. We don't want that to happen. Because if that happens, then the vaccine is not going to be effective at getting its instructions into the cell. And of course, AstraZeneca knows that if this vaccine is successful and it's used on a number of people, millions, billions of people worldwide, then it's probably going to have to abandon the chimpanzee adenovirus platform for delivering instructions. Now, the adenovirus here does not use RNA, like we were been talking about. It uses DNA. And DNA is a double-stranded form of instructions. Now, there's a portion there in the middle of that that is used for replication of the virus. Well, the genetic engineers simply delete that portion so the virus can no longer replicate and cause an infection in the human body. And instead, they replace that portion of the DNA with genetic code, the instructions that the geneticists have engineered. And so what happens when you deliver this adenovirus in the vaccine, it goes into the cell and it releases the DNA. It releases the DNA into the cytoplasm. And then that gets taken up and goes into the nucleus. That DNA, according to scientists at AstraZeneca, does not get incorporated into the host genome. It does not go into your DNA in the cell. And then, as a result of the DNA, the DNA is transferred into RNA. And then, the DNA is transferred into RNA. And then, the DNA is transferred into RNA. And then, the DNA is transferred into RNA. And then, the DNA is transferred into RNA. And then, the DNA is transferred into RNA. This contains proteins through translation by the ribosomes. And this goes on, once again, to cause the immunogenic response. Now, there's a couple of points that you should understand about the trial, the AstraZeneca and Oxford trial that's been looking at this vaccine. And let me just stress to you that the results that we have gotten here in the last few days are via press releases and not peer-reviewed articles that have been published and reviewed. viewed. So the first difference as we talked about is that it is a DNA virus platform. And there's been many areas that they've been doing research. And predominantly, let's take a look at two of those areas. The first one was in Brazil. And the second area that they did the trials was in the UK. Be also aware though that they are doing trials in the United States as well. And from the numbers, and I'm rounding these off, there's been about 9,000 people that have been enrolled in Brazil and about 3,000 that were enrolled in the UK. Now just like the other two vaccines that we were talking about, this is also a two step process. So there's two injections or two vaccinations. And they're about a month apart. Now by some error that occurred in the UK trial, they gave half a dose first followed by a full dose. Now in the Brazil trial, they gave a full dose like they were supposed to, followed by a full dose. And this happened approximately 28 days apart. Now if you've listened to us when we talked about the other two vaccines, you'll know that in those two vaccines, they did the trial a little differently in terms of the fact that they waited for subjects to become symptomatic with COVID-19 symptoms before looking at the endpoint there or a midway point to see whether or not the vaccine was effective. Here in the AstraZeneca case, they were not doing it that way. No, in fact, they were doing swabbing and they were checking for infections. This is a huge deal because whereas with the Pfizer biotech vaccine candidate and also the Moderna vaccine, all we can really say about those two, even now with the results that we have, is that it is definitely effective if what they're saying is true at preventing the symptoms of COVID-19, at preventing the disease, at preventing the things that cause people to go to the hospital. What we don't know right now about those two vaccines is whether or not the vaccine prevents infections. And that's important because infections leads to transmission and transmission leads to spread of the virus. Now here with the AstraZeneca Oxford study, they actually checked for infections by doing nasal swabs. And so what we can say here is whether or not there has been a stoppage or a ceasing of transmission and therefore infections. Now what was really interesting and kind of a headscratcher is in the Brazilian portion of this study where they gave the full dose on the first injection and the full dose on the second injection, the efficacy was only about 62 percent. Now I say only because we're comparing it to what we know now about the other two vaccines, but 62 percent is not a bad result and it certainly meets the benchmark or the threshold for getting emergency use authorization from the FDA both here in the United States and also in Europe. However, the part that's kind of a headscratcher is that when they, by some serendipitous error, they injected the subjects in the UK with half a dose on the first shot and then a full dose on the second shot, this one was actually 90 percent effective. And that's not just for preventing COVID-19, as I said, that may also, according to the preliminary results, prevent infections from what they're telling us. And so the US trial was paused because there were some events in two subjects in the United Kingdom and one subject in Brazil that was deemed later not to be related to the vaccine, but it took them time to investigate. They have restarted the USA portion of the trial, but now they want to see if they can in midstream modify that to introduce some half dosing as well combined with perhaps full dosing to see whether or not they're going to get a similar result either 62 or 90 percent or something in between. Now the other thing that was very interesting about this is that obviously some people are getting placebo's, but in not every situation are those placebo's just saline or salt water. In fact, in the first injection, what they have been doing is getting a meningitis vaccine dose because they wanted to reproduce the symptoms that people got when they got an injection because when you get an injection with saline, it doesn't cause irritation at the site as much. It doesn't cause pain at the site as much, but a regular vaccine, which would have nothing to do with coronavirus such as a meningitis vaccine, might do that. And so here AstraZeneca Oxford trial is a little different than the other two in that they were giving other vaccines as a placebo. And the reason why they're doing this is to get a more realistic placebo effect so that the subjects can't tell whether they've gotten the vaccine in this case or whether they're in the placebo arm. So what are some other possible advantages? Well, with the Moderna vaccine, as we talked about, it had to be stored if you wanted to store it for 30 days at negative 20 degrees centigrade or negative four degrees Fahrenheit. And as you recall for the Pfizer vaccine, it was even more extreme. It was at negative 70 degrees centigrade or negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit to store it for six months. Here, just a regular refrigerator is all that is necessary. In fact, it only needs to be stored at two to eight degrees centigrade or 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit. So those are some advantages there. And of course, because of that, you don't need to build an infrastructure system. You just need regular refrigeration to store this vaccine. The other thing that's very interesting as well is that AstraZeneca has promised not to make any profit during the pandemic on this vaccine. And so while the cost of giving the other two vaccines is around the $20 range, the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine is going to be sold for anywhere between three to five dollars. And not only that, the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine is potentially going to hit about three billion doses. And what's interesting is that because they only needed a half dose here for the 90 percent efficacy, they would actually be able to save some of that material. And that could immediately go as high as 4.5 billion doses. Worldwide. The other thing that's interesting politically as well is that because the United Kingdom is leaving the EU, they would be able to get this fast track within their own country without depending on EU approval. However, they are applying for EU approval as well. Other things that came out in that press release is that there were no serious side effects. The other thing that said too was that there were no severe COVID cases in those patients that got the vaccine. So let's review how was the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine similar to the Pfizer biotech and the Moderna vaccine. Well, it's similar in that two vaccinations are necessary, approximately one month apart. It's also similar in that it delivers the instructions to your cell for the cell itself to make the protein antigen that stimulates the body to make the immune response. But this candidate is different in the fact that it's a DNA virus. It's also different that it doesn't really require sub-zero temperatures to preserve it. It's also different in terms of the fact that it's could be a lot more affordable, especially for countries that don't have the infrastructure to keep these vaccines at very low temperatures. And it's also different that there is this head scratcher type of situation here where we don't really understand why this small UK group had such high efficacy, especially with only half the dose on the first dose. So right now we're kind of feeling around here in the dark what we really need to have and what we are going to have very shortly is the actual data released that will be peer reviewed and published. And if you want to read more about this, I'm going to put in the description below the links where we got this information from so you can do more research and find out for yourself.

Coronavirus Update 117: Moderna vs. Pfizer COVID 19 Vaccine (mRNA vaccines),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-11-17,eZvsqBCvB00,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. And we talked about the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last time. This time we're going to talk about the Moderna vaccine. Cases are still going up in the United States. And the daily deaths are increasing in the United States as well. And in terms of total cases per million population, the top states are North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa. So if there ever was a time to get a vaccine out, now is the time. So let's talk about this new Moderna mRNA vaccine and some of the recent results that have come out. We talked about the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last time. And I'm going to just sort of put up some notables about that vaccine so we can compare it to the Moderna vaccine. So one thing that's notable is that at 25 degrees Fahrenheit, the Moderna vaccine can actually last up to one month. But at that same temperature at 25 degrees Fahrenheit, which of course is below freezing, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine lasts for only about five days. However, if you cool the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine down to negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit, it can actually be stored for up to six months. Of course, it's difficult to get those type of refrigeration units. They are working on that. So the other difference that we see between these two vaccines is, whereas the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is on day one, and then another injection on day 22, the Moderna vaccine is on day one. And it's a little bit later, it's actually on day 29. So it's an additional week. And when they asked the participants to let them know after which date they developed symptoms in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, it was seven days after the last injection, whereas in the Moderna, it was 14 days. Now as you recall, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine results, and these were preliminary results that were released by the company, and we haven't gotten the peer review data on this as yet, but they said and they quoted about a 90 percent effective rate. And recently we also got data being reported by Moderna, again not peer reviewed, not published as yet, but they are claiming a 94.5 percent effective rate. And while we haven't gotten a lot of detailed information from Pfizer-BioNTech, we actually have gotten some granular data from Moderna. Let's talk about that at this point. So in the study, there was about 30,000 people, and just like the Pfizer-BioNTech study, there was racial diversity to the effect that there was around 11,000 people from communities of color. In addition to that, there was also 7,000 subjects that were 65 years and older, and there were 5,000 subjects that were less than the age of 65 that had comorbidities. And so what they did is they enrolled 30,000 subjects, and of course half of these got placebo and half of these got the one-two injection of the vaccine. And let's remind people again that this vaccine works in a very similar fashion as does the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in that it is a MRNA vaccine, which means that this mRNA, which is encapsulated in a lipid bilayer, is injected into the body, it merges with specific cells, and the messenger RNA is released into the cytoplasm, not the nucleus. And while it is there in the cytoplasm, it will interact with ribosomes, and the mRNA will be translated into proteins. And it's these proteins that are immunogenic and will cause antibodies to form, as well as other diverse immunogenic responses, such as a T cell response, etc. So when they randomized these 30,000 subjects to either the vaccine or placebo, they did it on day number one, they did it on day number 29, and they waited the 14 days and then asked them to call in if they had symptoms of COVID-19. Again, we're looking for the actual disease pattern of COVID-19. It was at that point that they were tested, and what they did was they waited for 95 people to become positive with COVID-19. Now that may sound like a small amount, but remember if the overall infection rate in a population is about 1 percent, then it's not unreasonable to believe that in 30,000 people that only about 300 people would actually become infected. So that 95 is a good place to do the interminalysis. So at this point, when they got the 95 subjects, the data monitoring board unblinded their side to see which patients got the placebo, and which ones got the vaccine so they could make a determination about the efficacy. This is an independent data monitoring board, and of course this is not under the control of Moderna. Well, what they found when they looked at those 95 cases is that in fact, 90 of those got the placebo, and only five of those got the actual vaccine. What is even more interesting and what we don't have data from the Pfizer-BioNTech people is that they actually had no severe cases in their cohort. Whereas in the Moderna cohort, they did have severe cases, but all 11 of those severe cases were in the placebo group. So this is encouraging news because it seems to show that the Moderna vaccine, number one, is 94.5 percent effective. And I don't know if that is statistically significantly different than the 90 percent here. So we don't know that Moderna is necessarily better than the Pfizer-BioNTech in terms of efficacy, but what we do see here is that it seems to be able to prevent severe COVID-19. So in terms of safety, looking at both the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna vaccine candidates, the Data Monitoring Committee has said that they have not seen any serious safety concerns with the Pfizer-BioNTech candidate, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board for Moderna has also said that there was no significant safety concerns. Now with Pfizer, they have said that they are going to be releasing more specific data on safety in the coming weeks. Now Moderna has given us a little bit more granular data and you should look that up. And in looking over the side effects, they were mostly mild to moderate. They were short-lived and they were the type of side effects that you would expect to see with any kind of vaccine, even a flu vaccine, such as fatigue, myalgyz, arthralgyz, headache, pain, and redness at the site. So you can see the differences here very clearly. The similarities are also very clear. Both of these vaccines seem to prevent disease very effectively. However, both are still in question about whether or not they prevent infection. In both you require two vaccine shots. In both of these vaccines, there seems to be a good randomization and also representation from communities of color. There also seems to be a lack of severe side effects that are concerning. But of course, because they've only been around for a few months, we don't have long-term safety data on either of these vaccines. And remember, we also don't know how long this type of effect from the vaccine is going to last. And of course, the other big similarity between these two, the Pfizer-Biontech and the Moderna, is that they are mRNA vaccines. And as it says here on the Moderna website, mRNA is a temporary set of instructions for cells to make a protein. And mRNA is made normally using DNA. But in this case, the vaccine itself contains messenger RNA. And that of course makes the proteins, which are the source of the immunogenic response in the body and causes a number of immune responses, including antibodies. And here is how Moderna depicts its vaccine. As you can see here, the messenger RNA is packaged. And there is a five-prime region, which keeps it from being broken down in the cytoplasm. And there's also a three-prime region and a polyetail here at the end, which also does something similar. Next time we're going to look at the other two vaccines that are coming up, and that includes the one from Johnson and Johnson, and also from AstraZeneca and Oxford. And those are not messenger RNA vaccines, but actually something rather different, which we'll take a look at next time. Meanwhile, while all this is happening here on the West Coast, we're starting to see stricter rules once again being imposed. Once again, there is going to be a restriction on indoor dining and also religious meetings inside and gyms, etc. There's also a travel restriction. As you can see here on Friday, Newsom and the governors of Oregon and Washington issued a travel advisory urging their residents to avoid non-essential travel and to quarantine for two weeks after arriving on the West Coast from another state or country. In Oregon, Governor Kate Brown also announced a two-week freeze to limit restaurants to offering only take-out food and close gyms. She said that the travel advisory would become a requirement if cases remain at current levels. And Washington's governor, Jay Inslee, has ordered gyms, bowling alleys, movie theaters, museums, and zoos to shut down indoor operations. The reason for limiting these things, of course, is to reduce the incidence of hospitalizations, which brings us to another interesting article in JAMA Network titled Outcomes for Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest in the United States during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. And this was published on November 14, 2020. And essentially, what they found was that during out of hospital cardiac arrest, the return of spontaneous circulation in those patients was 18 percent lower overall than before the pandemic. We also found that rates of survival to discharge were 17 percent lower primarily in communities with moderate to high COVID-19 mortality. And incidence of out of hospital cardiac arrest was higher, but largely in communities with high COVID-19 mortality. Here you can see the results that were stratified by county-level coronavirus disease in 2019. And the overall category, you can see here very clearly that there was 69.7 incidents of out of hospital cardiac arrest per 1 million residents. In 2020, that went up to 88.5 per 1 million residents. And as you can see here, as the county-level COVID-19 mortality rate increased, so did the difference between 2019 and 2020 for the most part. And that was all statistically significant. And the two theories behind this, why this was, in other words, is number one, many people may have been very concerned about going to the hospital because there were a lot of COVID-19 patients there. And therefore, their disease manifested itself much further along, and therefore it was much more difficult to convert those patients back into a spontaneous rhythm with spontaneous circulation. Therefore, there was a higher out of hospital cardiac arrest incidents. But another theory emerged and is detailed in this article, which will give you the link to. And that is that a number of the protocols that were initially started on these patients when EMS and first responders would go out, they modified it in a way so that there was perhaps less intervention in favor of protecting the first responders more from developing an infection with SARS-CoV-2. They said in the study, this raises the possibility of whether protocols that were rapidly put into place following the beginning of the pandemic could have influenced patients' likelihood of achieving sustained risk or return of spontaneous circulation. For instance, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association each established interim guidelines for EMS and its professionals during the pandemic, which included screening 911 calls for likelihood of COVID-19 infection, limiting the number of EMS personnel during initial response, pausing critical chest compressions during aerosolizing procedures such as intubation, limited bag mask ventilation, when done without specialized filtration, and not transporting patients to hospitals without risk or return of spontaneous circulation. Many of these recommendations are believed to be essential for protecting frontline healthcare workers from unnecessary exposure in communities severely affected by COVID-19 pandemic, but may also decrease the likelihood of a successful resuscitation. So I thought this was an interesting article because it shows the collateral damage of a pandemic. Tell me what your thoughts are below, and thank you for joining us.

Coronavirus Update 116: Pfizer COVID 19 Vaccine Explained (Biontech),MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-11-12,_jwBxZMWrng,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. It's been a little while because I've been in the intensive care unit treating COVID patients. Sorry to say that we are starting to expand a little bit in Southern California and we are seeing more patients now in the intensive care unit with COVID-19. If we look at daily new cases in the United States, the hair certainly on the uptick here. And whereas we had not seen an increase in the new daily death rate in the United States, it is now starting to increase. So where I work, which is in San Bernardino County, which is in Southern California, since the beginning of the pandemic, what's happened to hospitalizations, you can see here. The green graph is the confirmed COVID-19 positive patient representation. And the pink here on top are those that are suspected. You can see overall that hospitalizations here in Southern California are on the rise. And that is not unique. In terms of the United States, we're starting to see daily new cases in South Dakota start to reach all time highs. And the death rate is also going along with that as well. We're also seeing that in North Dakota as well in terms of daily new cases. And also the daily death rate as well. But perhaps the epicenter here in the United States would be the state of Texas, where we can see that daily new cases in Texas has reached an all time high. But daily deaths have not yet increased. That could be because of a time lag. Of course, this is not just the United States, but it's going up around the world. We see daily new cases increasing here and are at an all time high. And daily deaths around the world are also at an all time high. As an example, daily cases in the United Kingdom are quite elevated. And whereas before we do not see deaths increasing, we're starting to see daily death rates increase in the United Kingdom. In Italy, we are again seeing a increase in the daily new cases. And this is reminiscent of what we saw in March in Northern Italy, where we are seeing an increase in daily deaths as well at this point. And this is all to say that of course, there's a lot of bad news around the world. And we're going to talk about vaccines. And a great website to follow this is RAPS, or Regulatory Affairs Professional Society, which has a great COVID-19 vaccine tracker. And for the next couple of videos, we're going to highlight different vaccines that are being developed around the world for COVID-19. In the next few months or even weeks, there's going to be vaccines that are going to be available in the next few months or even weeks. There's going to be vaccines that are going to be released, brought to market, and consumers are going to have to make a choice as to which vaccine they want to get. It's going to be really important to understand and know about those vaccines and their track records. So we're going to dig deep and look at these vaccines and compare them looking at various characteristics, safety data, and efficacy. And the first one that we're going to look at is the vaccine that is being put out by Pfizer and Biontech. And you can see here on the COVID-19 vaccine tracker, there are a number of different vaccines that you can click on them. And there are links so that you can look at the different publications and be educated on these vaccines. So the first thing that we're going to look at is the Pfizer Biontech one that is here. And let's get started. So the first thing that you've got to understand is the biochemistry of what's happening with an infection. Now as we've talked about before, you have a cell and on that cell is a ACE-2 receptor. And then what you have is the virus. And on the virus as you've heard by now are spike proteins. And so what happens is the spike protein interacts with this ACE-2 receptor and the virus gets internalized in the cell and it basically takes over the cell or hijacks the machinery of the cell. And so really this interaction between the spike protein and this ACE-2 receptor needs to be blocked if you want to prevent infection. And one of the ways of doing that traditionally is by injecting fragments of the protein into the body and have antibodies be made against these spike proteins. So that the virus is not allowed to bind this ACE-2 receptor and you neutralize this infection. And that's generally how vaccines have worked in the past. And the way that this virus SARS-CoV-2, how it does this is that there is this mRNA genome which is inside of the virus. And so when the virus binds with the cell, the cell internalizes the envelope but it also internalizes the messenger RNA inside the cell. Now if we were to blow this up and show you what happens inside, it would look something like this. Here's the cell with the nucleus. In the nucleus you have DNA and that DNA is converted into RNA. And these are made up of nucleotides. Well that RNA is converted into messenger RNA and it's exported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where you then have something called messenger RNA which is still in the same language as the DNA is. But now you've got mRNA. And mRNA is a very specific structure. It has something we call a five prime cap. It has information and then it has a non-transcribed region at the end with a poly-A tail. And this is what allows you to make proteins because this messenger RNA is translated by something called ribosomes into protein. And it's this protein that can turn into just about any type of protein you want depending on the instructions here in the mRNA. Now as we talked about before, when SARS-CoV-2 infects the cells, it causes the machinery in the cell to make proteins for more viruses. And so it's making more spike proteins, it's making more proteins that go on its surface. It's making a whole bunch of other things that go into making more SARS-CoV-2 virus. And of course these proteins here can be incorporated into the cell membrane or they can be exported to outside the cell. So this sort of brings this to why Pfizer and Biontech are teaming up. It's because the German company Biontech has perfected or at least significantly advanced the technology of infecting with messenger RNA. And so how this new vaccine is going to work is they have a way of making messenger RNA but delivering it to the cells in a lipid membrane. Now if you imagine a micelle or a lipid bilayer in which the mRNA is enclosed into, so it's well protected, these very small particles can then fuse with these cells. And then what happens is the messenger RNA that they have engineered goes into the cells here and that engineered messenger RNA will then create a protein that they have genetically engineered. And in this case that protein is a version if you will of the spike protein. But it's a version that is slightly different in that it holds the position of what it looks like when it is docked outside the SARS-CoV-2 virus not after it binds and is internalized into the cell. So that the final product of this messenger RNA after it goes into your cells and after your cells take their messenger RNA and make the protein that they want your cells to make. It's going to make a protein inside of your body that is going to be immunogenic and cause you to form antibodies against this spike protein. And here's what it looks like. This is a publication that was published on BioArchive and we'll give you the link to it in the description below. But you can see here that this is the messenger RNA that they have constructed. Here is the five prime cap analog. Here are the coding sites for the receptor binding domain. That's where the spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor. And here is S1, S2. These are portions of the spike protein. And then you can see here is the non or untranslated region. And then finally the poly-A tail. These additions to the messenger RNA allow it to escape destruction in the cytoplasm of the native cells. So in other words it preserves it so that it gets translated into the protein. And here's a picture of the protein here down below that your body makes from the instructions from this vaccine. It's a very immunogenic structure that causes antibodies to be made. Now last month in the New England Journal of Medicine they published an article called Safety and Immunogenicity of two RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates. And these were the two candidates that were put forth by Pfizer and Biontech. And they wanted to see basically how these two candidates did to see which ones would go on to the phase two and phase three trials. Let's take a look at these because one of the big questions that we're going to have when we take a vaccine is how safe is this vaccine. And while we're not going to get a full picture early on because a lot of the data takes months and months to come out, we can certainly see up front what type of a profile these vaccines have. And you should know what the names of these two candidates are. The first one is BNT 162B1 and the second one is BNT 162B2. So we'll call this number one and number two. And basically what they found was while they were not looking for efficacy, they were looking for safety, they found that the second vaccine, number two, was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions. So the first thing we're going to do is look at some of the side effects and we're going to look at both vaccines, both one and two, and we're going to look at the older population and the younger population. So first let's look at the younger population 18 to 55 years of age that's we're seeing here on this graph. And the two graphs up top are vaccine number one and the one here on the bottom is vaccine number two. And just that first blush you can see here that vaccine number two seems to have less in terms of side effects. Now the other thing that I should mention is that they are looking at making this a two step vaccine process with the first vaccine being given and then the second one being given on day 21 or three weeks later. Interestingly also this vaccine would have to be refrigerated in very tightly controlled refrigerators. And so here the first column is the first dose and the second column is the second dose. Let's take a look here at vaccine number two. You can see here that at least 60 to 70 to even 80 or 90 percent of these patients had some sort of pain at the injection site. That's not too unreasonable. But in terms of redness, swelling, either on the first dose or the second dose of the second vaccine that it doesn't look like there was a lot in terms of side effects. It seems as though the 30 microgram dose gave the most in terms of side effects. If we look in the older population, 65 to 85, once again in the vaccine number two, there seems to be less side effects than in vaccine number one. And once again, the biggest problem was pain at the injection site, but in terms of redness and swelling, we didn't see much there. What about more systemic effects? These are the kind of side effects that we're actually looking for a little bit more carefully. Once again, let's look at the second vaccine that was being developed. That's B2 here on the bottom two, fever, fatigue, chills, both in the first dose and in the second dose were much less than that in the first vaccine that was being developed. And that dose two seemed to give higher side effects or higher incidence of side effects. The biggest one in terms of incidence was fatigue in both the first dose and in the second dose ranging from about 40 to 70 percent. If you look at participants in the 65 to 85 years of age group, you can see how the second vaccine or B2 had far fewer side effects than B1. So you can see the conclusions that the authors came to. They said the safety and the immunogenicity data from this United States phase one trial added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data support the selection of B2 for advancement to a pivotal phase two, three safety and efficacy evaluation. And that's exactly what they did. A press release about the preliminary results came out about five days ago and they had enrolled 43,538 participants in this randomized blinded trial. And so what they decided as they did some calculations and they figured that when they had heard that 94 confirmed cases had occurred, they were going to take a peek at the data to see how it looked. What they were looking for was to see how many of these patients who got COVID had gotten the placebo versus had gotten the actual vaccine. And what they were able to conclude based on the data from those first 94 confirmed cases of COVID-19 was that the vaccine B2 was found to be more than 90 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 in participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in this analysis. And what they're actually asking for now is to continue the study to go up to 164 confirmed cases to see if this holds up and if there are other data points that can be made. That's important because if they were not to do that, if they were to end the study, it would be considered unethical to randomize someone to a placebo given the fact that the vaccine is so effective at preventing COVID-19, a potentially deadly disease. And here is the press release announcing these preliminary results. We don't have this in a peer-reviewed publication as yet, but I'm sure it's coming. You know, in terms of what's actually going on biochemically inside these people who get this vaccine is very interesting. And there are some hints because if we look at some earlier trials with this very same vaccine in monkeys and in mice, we see some very interesting things. And this was a paper that was published in Medical Archive, which we will put in the description below in terms of the links. What they did is in this study, before they did the Phase 1 trials that we just reported on, they looked at how this vaccine candidate behaved in monkeys and in mice. And so they say here that this LNP formulated nucleoside modified mRNA that encodes the spike glycoprotein, captured in its pre-fusion confirmation, which is what you want. You want it to look exactly as it does on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. So what they found was that these neutralizing geometric titers were 10 to 18 times that of the SARS-CoV-2 convalescent human serum panel. And not only that, but this very same vaccine that they gave in humans later on, when they gave it to macaques and to mice, they found that their TH1 type CD4 positive and interferon gamma positive response was elevated. And a CD8 positive T cell response was also activated. And all of this points toward a wide and diverse immune response. And one has to figure whether or not this is the reason why it seems, at least on preliminary data, that this vaccine is 90 percent effective. So let's talk a little bit about the vaccine. Here you can see these lipid nanoparticles that contain the messenger RNA with the code in it. So if we look at what we have here with the vaccine from Pfizer-Biontech, they say it's effective at preventing COVID-19 at around 90 percent. Now realize the way these endpoints worked was that seven days after the second vaccine dose. So at 28 days after the first vaccine dose, study subjects were asked to contact the site coordinator if the patients had any symptoms of COVID-19. And if after evaluation, it was likely that they had COVID-19, these subjects were given a COVID-19 test. The study was interrupted when the number of subjects with COVID-19 positive test results reached 94. When this happened, they unblinded the 94 so they could see who did and who did not get the vaccine. It was at that time that they released some preliminary results showing that the vaccine was about 90 percent effective. So some interesting points about that is that really there are no asymptomatic subjects in this result cohort. We don't know what this does to asymptomatic patients. And furthermore, we don't know how long this effect lasts either. So those will be questions that have to be answered down the line. Of note, the Data Monitoring Committee reported that there was no serious safety concerns. The other question is does it stop infection? That's important because this vaccine may be just important in the individual that gets it at preventing them from getting the disease COVID-19. But the question is that it's actually stop infection with SARS-CoV-2. That's important because if it doesn't stop infection, then you can still infect people with the virus and it can still multiply exponentially. But if it has a sterilizing effect, then it's potentially possible that you could block the spread of the disease. That is still up in the air and a question at this point. Now a couple of numbers that you should know Pfizer believes that they should have about 50 million doses by the end of the year. And they are working right now to try to get emergency use authorization. They also say that they should have about 1.3 billion doses by next year. You need to realize that there are two doses. Both doses need to be refrigerated in special refrigerators that keep them at negative 70 degrees centigrade. And the question is, how much is this all going to cost? Well, they're saying that per injection, the cost will be about $19.50. But there has been some reports that they are working with the US government. And for those in the United States, it should work out to be free. Now also remember this too, is that apparently Pfizer did not take any government money in the production of this vaccine. And furthermore, Pfizer is looking at producing this vaccine worldwide. So this vaccine does have some promise. I would be very interested to hear what you all have to say about this vaccine. It's one of four of the vaccines that we're going to do a deep dive and look into. I think this one is interesting because of its novel approach using messenger RNA. Of course, there's another vaccine candidate that is doing that as well. And that's of course the Moderna candidate, which we'll talk about coming up next. Keep in mind that no mRNA-based vaccine has been approved by the FDA. But this particular candidate is interesting because we have the preliminary safety data in. And it looks as though we have the preliminary results of a report about the efficacy data. Of course, more of that is to come when it gets published. And so people can start to make a decision about if this vaccine becomes available and gets emergency use authorization. And when it becomes available, if they would decide to get this vaccination.

Coronavirus Update 112: Linoleic Acid; Vaccines; UK COVID 19 Data,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-10-13,VB06uVA97zI,"Welcome to another Meg Kram COVID-19 update. Here in the United States, we have a slight increase in the daily new cases nationally. Daily deaths are still on the decline at this point. In the United Kingdom, daily cases are still on the rise. Whereas daily new deaths in the United Kingdom are still relatively small. In Canada, the daily new cases seem to have reached a peak. We'll have to see here what direction it goes with more time. And while there's been some recent activity in terms of daily new deaths in Canada, this may be on the way down. In Brazil, the daily new case rate seems to be going down here every single week. And we're seeing a similar trend as well in terms of daily new deaths in Brazil. If we look at Finland, which we looked at a number of months ago in terms of their hydrotherapy, and their proclivity to use SONAs, we can see here that the number of daily new cases is on the rise. But there's really been a posse of actual deaths on a daily basis here in Finland. If we try to compare that to Sweden, we see here that the daily new cases are on the rise. But in terms of the daily deaths in Sweden, there really hasn't been an increase since August 1st. So that's very encouraging news for Sweden. So the question always is, what's the point if the cases are going up, but the deaths aren't going up? Well, of course, there's a lot of real estate between cases and deaths. There's hospitalizations, morbidity, etc. And so for that, we go to a website that's actually keeping track of this, at least in the United Kingdom, where we can see since the pandemic started what's going on with testing and with cases. And clearly you can see here that there is just a dramatic more than three or even fourfold increase in not only the capacity of PCR testing, but also in PCR tests that have been actually processed. And so because of that, you can see here it's no surprise that the amount of cases has gone up because the testing has gone up. But you may want to notice something here. These are linear Y-axis going from zero at the bottom to 100,000, 200,000, 300,000. Here we have cases in the very similar type of progression. It's not log-rhythmic. And clearly you can see here that the amount of testing has linearly increased. Whereas here on this graph, the amount of cases has, it seems non-linearly or maybe even exponentially increased. And so while I think it's reasonable to say that the amount of cases that we're having now, at least in Europe and maybe even just the UK, the reason why these cases have gone up in comparison to the peak that we had in May, is probably a result of increased testing. But we can't say that the week over week increase here in the last month or two is just because of that testing. That would be my hypothesis. Now if we go through and look and see what's going on here in terms of healthcare, here we have hospitalizations that are occurring in the beginning around April and May. You can see very, very high. And then it's dropped off considerably. And only now is it starting to pick up. So there has been an increase in hospitalizations although nowhere near the height that we saw back in April and May in the United Kingdom. And fortunately patients in ventilator beds and patients being admitted to the hospital. So again, this gray bar is the number of patients total that are in the hospital. The dark blue bar are the patients that are being admitted to the hospital. And then this lighter blue are the patients in ventilator beds. And of course these are all patients with COVID-19. Over here on the side, we see the deaths. And these here are deaths within 28 days of a positive test. So of course, there's going to be some patients which have deaths that are not related to COVID-19. But nevertheless, we wouldn't expect those to change dramatically here since April. And here's a deeper dive into the number of patients that are being admitted from the different countries that make up the United Kingdom. And you can see here that the majority of these cases are in England. And of course, that also goes for the deaths. Most of them seem to be in England. I wanted to talk about an interesting development that really has some unknown and potential insights into coming up with therapeutic options. And that is this paper that was published in science called Free Fadi Acid Binding Pocket in the locked structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. So what they're saying basically in this article is that there's a fatty acid called linoleic acid, which actually is an essential fatty acid. It's an essential fatty acid that also happens to be an omega-6 fatty acid. And apparently what they found is that there are binding sites on the spike protein. The spike protein is part of the SARS-CoV-2 outer layer, which binds to the ACE-2 receptor on human cells. And so what they find is that if the linoleic acid binds to the spike protein at particular areas, it causes the confirmation of that spike protein to be in what they call a tight configuration. And essentially, what that does is it prevents, in some fashion, the binding of that spike protein to the ACE-2 receptor. They say here in the abstract that there are 2.85 angstrom cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, reveals that the receptor binding domains or the RBDs tightly bind the essential free fatty acid, linoleic acid, or LA. In three composite binding pockets, the pockets also appear to be present in the highly pathogenic coronavirus of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. LA binding stabilizes the locked S-conformation, giving rise to reduced ACE-2 interactions in vitro. In human cells, LA supplementation synergizes with the COVID-19 drug remdesivir, suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication as well. So here you can see where this binding site is in the spike protein. And you can see that there's a pocket. And when that binds, it locks the protein into a confirmation that does not really encourage binding to the ACE-2 receptor. Here's a closer look at that. And we can see here the chemical structure of linoleic acid. It's known as an omega-6 fatty acid because if you count from the end, which is the omega end of the alphabet, and you count six carbons in, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, you'll get the first double bond. And here's another view of those trimer. So these trimer or three proteins come together in this S-protein. And you can see here the linoleic acid, which is this yellow structure here, here, and here. And what that does is it causes a tight confirmation of this protein as opposed to when they're not being bound, it's a much more open confirmation. It's this loose and open confirmation that can bind the ACE-2 receptor better. In this situation, it does not bind the ACE-2 receptor as well. And the thought there is that might mitigate infectivity of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2. So before you feel the need to increase your dietary intake of linoleic acid, there actually is a nutritional quandary as published a couple of years ago in this paper that was published online in healthcare. As it turns out, apparently over the course of the last century, there's been a 20-fold increase in the consumption of vegetable oils resulting both from their increased availability and from recommendations to consume these oils in a way of lowering the risks of coronary artery disease from elevated cholesterol. And apparently, this has reached a total of about 6 percent, which is pretty high of total dietary energy. The article goes on to say that there's been meta-analyses, which have disagreed about the role of dietary linoleic acid in atherosclerosis. And recent publications indicate that linoleic acids reduction of blood cholesterol levels does not predict its effect on the development of atherosclerosis. Now, because linoleic acid is a precursor to arachidonic acid, which is involved in inflammation, there is concern that there may be detrimental effects on elevated dietary linoleic acid. It's interesting to note that in a recent survey of geographic areas around the world that have longevity that was actually studied by national geographic, the five areas that met the criteria of longevity, all of them, as listed here, had dietary intakes of linoleic acid that were actually below the current intakes in the United States. Now, to be fair, the authors of this study aren't really suggesting that we increase our dietary intake of linoleic acid, but rather that this novel approach may suggest itself in terms of looking for therapeutic options that could interact with these binding places. We shall see as time moves forward. In other news, we are looking at vaccination, and this time, the vaccine trial that is sponsored by Johnson and Johnson has just announced that their study has been paused due to unexplained illness in one of the study's participants. Now, there are certain rules that will trip a potential pausing that would shut down the study temporarily so that they could figure out whether or not this illness was the result of the vaccine. Remember now that this is a 60,000 patient clinical trial. So, with that many patients in the trial, you're bound to get somebody coming down with some severe illness. That's just the way things are. Think about that. That's about the number of people that would come to a very large baseball game or football game. The question, though, is was it the result of the vaccine or was it a result of just chance? And so epidemiologists and clinicians are trained to look at that. I'm sure there will be unblinding of that patient to see whether or not they got the placebo or whether or not they actually got the vaccine and then make a determination about whether or not the chances of something like this happening and whether or not the biological aspects of it make sense. And this should be somewhat encouraging because while it's not a good thing to have someone have a bad response in a study like this, we don't know whether or not it was caused by the vaccine yet. It is reassuring to know that these companies are undergoing and continuing with the same safety protocols. And we will just have to wait and see exactly what happens. And in terms of some good news here, in California, the Los Angeles Times is reporting that Californians hospitalized with COVID-19 is at their lowest levels in six months. And that is some good news after a very beleagering fire season here over the last couple of months. So with that, we'll wrap things up here. Don't forget to check us out on MedCram.com.

"Coronavirus Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, & Vaccine Status (Recorded January 27, 2020)",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-01-27,UCG3xqtcL3c,"Thanks for joining us for our second video in the coronavirus. If this is the first video you're seeing on that, please go back to our first video to get the introduction about what exactly is this coronavirus of 2019. They're calling it as it turns out. It was discovered on the last day of 2019, December 31st. So what are the symptoms and what's going on with this virus clinically? So there was a great article that was published in the Lancet just recently about this, about 41 patients that came in to the hospital there and were diagnosed with molecular technique to show that they actually had the virus for the coronavirus. In those patients, about 41, 98 percent of them had fever, 76 percent had cough, and 55 had shortness of breath. What was lacking here was the sneezing, running nose, that type of thing that you would expect to see with a regular virus. Those were kind of lacking here. What did they find? This is a pretty good indication of if you're sick enough to go to the hospital, this is what you might expect. So just so you're aware, 100 percent of these were confirmed with molecular technique of being the 2019 NCOV, which is the coronavirus. So what was the median age? Median age was 49. So these are not old people. 75 percent of them were men, and surprisingly only 32 percent had underlying comorbidities. Now what's interesting is that 66 percent of these people that were hospitalized were exposed to that specific meat market. And as I mentioned, there was one family grouping that seemed to have gone to this meat market that came down with this virus. What's concerning is that it took about eight days to develop the shortness of breath, and those patients who did develop shortness of breath after the illness. So in other words, there was an incubation period of maybe about a week or two, and then there was the illness that lasted for eight days, and then there was the shortness of breath. And what did that shortness of breath lead to? In 100 percent of the cases, there were signs of pneumonia on chest CT, and 29 percent of these patients developed ARDS, which is a pretty serious and significant lung disease leading to the last statistic here was that the mortality was 15 percent. So there's about six patients that died as a result of this. And one of them was a young man that had no comorbidities at all, and so that's actually rather concerning. So what about treatment? Well, as it turns out, treatment is just supportive, which means if they're dry, you give them fluids, which means if they can't breathe, you put them on a ventilator. But there is no medication that is going to speed up the effect of the virus to get it out of your system more quickly. So in terms of actual specific treatment, there is no treatment. There is no medication. But there is a drug company called Regeneron, which is looking into a treatment and has some promising developments. And there is no vaccine. However, the United States NIH is saying that they're actually developing one shortly. So what is actually being done about it? Well, as of this recording, there's about 35 million people in China that are on lockdown. And it's all around this area called Wuhan. So what should you do? Well, I would avoid going to Wuhan at this point. Number two, if you have travel to Wuhan and you get sick, make sure you call a medical professional immediately and make sure you tell them that you are sick and that you're from Wuhan in that area and make sure that you take appropriate precautionary measures of isolation before you go in. Listen to what their advice is in terms of how to present yourself so that you don't spread this virus to somebody else. This is a developing story and we'll be giving updates as they come in. But at this point, it seems as though the worst is not over yet and the amount of people that are infected continue to rise to well over 1300. Stay tuned for more. Thanks for watching this video."
"Coronavirus Update 3: Spread, Quarantine, Projections, & Vaccine (Recorded January 28, 2020)",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-01-28,SJBYwUtB83o,"Welcome to another Meg Cram lecture. We're going to talk about an update for coronavirus. As of 127 2020 we have in China 4,428 infected and 106 that have died. Now one of those that died recently was Beijing's first reported death. And this is a 50-year-old gentleman who visited Wuhan on January 8th and developed fever seven days later on the 15th, went to the hospital on the 21st and then died on the 27th. So this kind of gives you at least an example of one in terms of the natural history of what we're talking about. Now over the past day or so there's been some epidemiologists in China that have looked at this and they're trying to parse exactly how well the containment or the quarantining of this area is and they've come up with some pretty sober results. They say that optimistically if we were to get a 90 percent containment of the area they predict based on their models that the peak infection would hit about 59,000 people and that would mean that would be about 1,500 deaths. Now if the containment was worse than that and there's been some news about that recently because the mayor of Wuhan said that about 5 million people went out of the city after there was the virus. And so if you look at a worst-case scenario of only 50 percent containment of the area based on the models that they've come up with is 5 million people being infected and a death rate of about 100,000 people. And in terms of the publication this I'm going to go ahead and put the links in the description below so you'll have the links to all of this stuff that I'm going to talk about today. So things have kind of heated up. We have Sri Lanka having its first case. This is a Chinese tourist that went to Sri Lanka and this patient's being hospitalized in the capital of Colombo. We have the United States ordering a level 3 alert saying no non-essential travel to China. We have a quarantine in China of about 50 million people and one of the areas that's really going to be of high interest is this whole idea of whether the virus can be contracted when the patient or the index case is asymptomatic. This claim was first made by the China's health minister but there is growing concern because the United States and their health department personnel have been unable to look at the data in China because they're not being allowed to look at that data to see exactly how is it possible that somebody who does not have symptoms is able to transmit the virus. And so we're not exactly able to back up that claim as of this moment. Better news in the US there's been no new confirmed cases overnight so we've got four or five cases we got two in California, one in Los Angeles County, the other one in Orange County. We have the one in Washington state and that's an interesting story in and of itself. So in Washington state the index case themselves is a gentleman who actually went to the market in Wuhan and currently health investigators are looking at about 64 different people that he might have had contact with and they're tracking them down and seeing whether or not they have the virus. So far the index case himself is doing fine. Getting back to California as we mentioned there are cases in Orange County and also in Los Angeles County. What was just recently announced is that Ontario International Airport is going to be the Repatriation Center for about 240 Americans who are going to be repatriated back to the United States out of China and that is a chartered flight and it's first going to go to Anchorage Alaska for refueling and it's at that point that they're going to have their first health check and then it will be going on to Ontario International Airport in Southern California where they will be as soon as they get off the plane they're going to be screened to make sure that they're not sick and to make sure that they don't have the virus and there's more details on that article. So that's something that's been in the news just recently in the last few hours. Interesting news out of Canada there is a case in Toronto which I know very well since I'm originally from Toronto. The patient came from Wuhan and is currently in a hospital there in Toronto called Sunnybrook, Healthcare Sciences. Interestingly the husband is in hospital but the patient's wife has also tested positive for the coronavirus. However she's at home and she's doing quite fine without any symptoms and I think this is an interesting illustration of how variable the presentation can be of this virus in different individuals and we're assuming here that they both picked it up at the market there in Wuhan, China and hopefully that the husband did not give it to the wife and that would be the first case of a human to human transfer outside of China so far. We have not had any evidence at least in the United States or in fact anywhere else in the world other than China where there has been a human to human transmission of this virus. So that's good news. Okay let's talk about vaccines here. Johnson and Johnson is getting into the fray and trying to come up with a vaccine for this virus. They're saying that it's going to take anywhere between eight to 12 months before human testing can take place. The NIH on the other hand is saying that they may have something ready in about three months. It'll be interesting to see where we will be at that time. A lot of epidemiologists are saying that the peak of this epidemic may be reached in about three months time. Aside note here on Johnson and Johnson they have a very powerful HIV medication which interestingly as you may know HIV is an RDA virus as well and they're wanting to see whether or not the HIV medication is going to be effective against the coronavirus and that medication is prescobics so that'll be interesting to see how that works. Now a common question that gets asked is exactly how does this virus kill somebody? Why is it that people succumb to the virus and what mechanism and in most of the cases it's respiratory failure and something called ARDS. So in the next video I'm going to talk about ARDS and exactly how is it that we treat it? What do we do for it? And why is it that we need to have updated ICUs to deal with ARDS? And what's been the recent evidence in the last couple of years for treating ARDS and how can we improve survival for some of these viruses? That's going to be in the next video. Thanks for joining us and stay tuned for further updates."
"Coronavirus Epidemic Update 25: Vaccine Developments, Italy's Response, and Mortality Rate Trends",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-02-25,UImSVhLLeGY,"Welcome to another MEDCRAM lecture on the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the COVID-19 disease. This update is for the 25th of February 2020 and we're going to talk about Italy and China and then vaccines. This is going to be kind of interesting when we get into that. And again, here are the numbers that they are reporting. So I'm simply reporting what they are reporting and with hit 80,000 proper total deaths at almost 27,000 total recovered 27,000. And so we're up to a differential there of 10 times. I remember when that was almost on par. In fact, when it was even less than the number of total deaths. So whereas total deaths have leveled off, we still have an increasing amount of total recovered, which is always a good thing. Let's look at the nucleus wealth site, which I've found to have some interesting graphs that are unique to it. I'm going to scroll the way down here to the bottom where they talk about the mortality rate or the case fatality rate. And as we've talked about, there is a bit of a delay in measuring what the total cases are right now compared to what the total deaths are right now. There's been a question about whether or not you should delay the mortality counts and look back four days, eight days or 12 days, depending on how long it takes somebody in average to die from the onset. And in looking at those, it's interesting that if you look at all of the cases outside of Wuhan in the rest of China, you can see here that if you look at a full 12 days out that the mortality rate or case fatality rate reaches around the same asymptote as if you look at eight days versus if you look at four days, and that's just under 1 percent. If you look at Hubei Province, which is where Wuhan is, and you do the same sort of analysis, it all settles out again, but not just below 1 percent, but just below 5 percent. This kind of makes sense if you think about the fact that inside Hubei, where most of the cases were, their health care industry is going to be more overwhelmed and therefore perhaps have a higher case fatality rate. So you can take a look at this site, we'll put the link to it in the description below. We go over to the worldometer as we have done in the past. We can see similar numbers here where I like to look at the active cases and the closed cases of the closed cases that we have, 91 percent of recovered and been discharged and 9 percent deaths. If we look further on down, we come to the latest updates. For February 25th, we can see here that there's one new death in South Korea, another death on the diamond princess, two new cases in Italy, and 60 new cases in South Korea. Possibly some good news here in South Korea is that the 60 new cases that we're seeing today in South Korea is a sharp decline in new cases compared to 161. And so this may be that there might be a cluster. In fact, that's what they're saying, that there's two clusters and that has to do with this church where they had met and this may be the reason for the spreading and this accounts for over 50 percent of the cases within South Korea. Let's go over to another site. This is by Reuters title battle against coronavirus turns to Italy. Wall Street falls on pandemic fares over a thousand point loss on the Dow Jones on the 24th. Couple of interesting things here, kind of contrast what they did in China and what's going on in Italy, of course, in China, things seem to be not rising as fast and in Italy, things seem to be climbing pretty rapidly. And so they talk here about China putting cities and lockdown, Italian authorities are also doing similar things, sealing off the worst affected towns, closing schools, halting the carnival and Venice. What they say here, interestingly, this is from Reuters, China's actions, especially in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases. Said the head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Alward, the rest of the world to learn from the lesson of acting fast. They're at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of the hospitals each day is more than the sick going in, he said. The surge of cases outside of mainland China triggered sharp falls in global markets, specifically in Italy, as investors fled to safe havens, and they talked about the European equities markets. He goes on to talk about the epidemic in China peaking between January 23rd and February 2nd, and they say has been declining since. Dr. Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO Emergency's Program, told reporters, it is still possible to contain the virus, and that it might appear each year like the flu. Quote, the virus may settle down into an endemic pattern of transmission, into a seasonal pattern of transmission, or it could accelerate into a full-blown global pandemic. He said in Geneva on Monday, and at this point, it's not possible to say which of these realities is going to happen. Goes on to talk about how the Trump administration is requesting a billion dollars to deal with the coronavirus. Now, specifically, what it is that's going on in China, we've got China's National Health Commission said that while the rapid rise had been halted, the situation was still grim. He said over 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan probably due to the lack of protective gear and fatigue. And we talked about the fact that the case of a tally rate in Wuhan was higher than it is in the rest of China. We also talked previously about the fact that there was no protective gear, but we also talked about the need for sleep and the ability to sleep and get rest. And of course, if there are a number of professional colleagues of yours who are infected in quarantine, that's going to increase the load on you. That's going to make you more fatigued. And hence, we see videos of healthcare providers in China collapsing. And we hear a number of these physicians are actually succumbing to the virus. So at this point, excluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases. That's the lowest since they started actually taking figures on January 20th. Overall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland down from 648 a day earlier. There was a measure of relief. It says for the world's second largest economy is more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai. Here we go. Reported zero new infections. Whereas what's going on outside of China? Well, things are taking off. We've got 29 countries and territories with a death toll of about two dozen, according to the Reuters tally, South Korea, 231 new cases making its total to 833. We see a couple of new countries that have come to the table here, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Afghanistan. They are believed to be cases that have been to Iran in the past. So a lot of things going on. It's almost like a tale of two cities. It seems as though China has had a huge hit, but things may be on the verge of something different potentially. We'll have to see. And then we have Italy and South Korea, which are taking off. Want to talk briefly about another interesting article. This is in the Wall Street Journal. We'll put a copy of this link as well on the description below. This fascinating article, which you will probably need to have a log in to read, talks about this drug maker Moderna Incorporated, which has shipped its first batch of its rapidly developed coronavirus vaccine to US government researchers who will launch the first human tests of whether the experimental shot could help suppress the epidemic originating in China. Now, why is this experimental? Well, I encourage you to actually watch the video that is on this site, and you'll see what I'm talking about. But very briefly, let me explain to you what it is that's going on there. Okay, so normally what happens is a virus, here's the virus, goes in and infects a cell. And what happens is these proteins go on the surface of the cell when this virus infects the cell. These proteins here are very important because it tells the body that this is an infected cell or that this, for instance, is a virus. And what they normally do is they will normally take the virus and they will inactivate it or kill it. And they will inject it in. And what will happen here is that these proteins will induce an antibody response in the body that allows the body to have many of these antibodies already to fight. So this is the normal situation up here. And the problem is it takes many months to create this type of model where you can inject these proteins into the body so that you can have these antibodies form against these proteins. What they're planning on doing from what I'm getting from this article is something completely different in terms of a vaccine. What they're really doing here is they're having a cell. And because they have the genome of this virus, they're able to inject in this case the RNA somehow into the body. And this RNA will then go into the cells, which will tell the cells to produce the antigens, which will then cause the antibodies to form against it. So in other words, instead of having the virus or the lab produce these antigens to inject into the human so that the human can make antibodies, what they're instead doing is isolating the genomic sequences themselves, having them tell your own cells to produce these antigens. And then these antigens are going to cause antibodies to be formed. And that is how they can do this much faster because they don't have to go through all the sequences of having this be done. In other words, making this, they can have your cells make the vaccine for you and then have you self immunize against the virus. And it seems as though this really hasn't been done before. And so according to that Wall Street Journal article, it looks as though they're going to be starting clinical trials in April. And so that would be three months from the time that they learned about the genome to the point where they can actually get a vaccine for human clinical trials. Now this is a new technology. And for some people, this may sound really cool. For others, it may be, well, what are the side effects of this? What's going to happen when you're starting to put DNA or RNA instructions, messenger RNA in most cases in this case, into your cells and tell them to make proteins that are foreign to your body to cause an immune response. It almost sounds like an autoimmune condition. So it's going to be interesting to see what happens and what are the side effects of this. To get a better understanding of this, you're going to need to know about molecular biology. And as it just so happens, we have a video that's a primer on molecular biology because what we're about to do is get into the details of the coronavirus life cycle and what it actually does in the cell and how it's different from other viruses. Thanks for joining us."
"Coronavirus Pandemic Update 43: Shortages, Immunity, & Can a TB Vaccine (BCG) Help Prevent COVID-19?",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-03-24,LqKwAIIy-Mo,"What's another MedCram COVID-19 updates? We can see that we're almost at 400,000 total confirmed worldwide. If we look here at the new daily deaths in the United States, we can see that that is increasing. There's been some interesting quotes in the news here for March 24th, and they anticipate that the peak number of cases is still two to three weeks away in New York. The governor of New York has said that they need 37,000 ventilators at that point, and they need to get another 30,000 because they've got about 7,000 now at this point. There's an ominous warning coming from New York saying that because they're first, what is happening there could be what's happening in your community in about four to six weeks. They are also saying that hundreds of thousands of people probably have already had COVID-19, didn't know that they had it, and have recovered. And they're echoing what we've said here earlier, which is that antibodies should be checked for because if they're positive for the antibodies, then they don't need to stay home. They could go to work. Which brings me to this news that was on Yahoo! Fever map could show just how crucial it is to stay home to stop COVID-19 spread. This is a smart thermometer made by Kinsa, which is able to upload the data from people who are taking their temperatures and put it on a map. And what they've shown here through this article, and we'll put a link to it, is that in Florida, there are a number of people who have had elevated temperatures more than they would have guessed for this time of year. If you look at the data, the blue is what would be expected, and you can see here, as you go from February 14 to May 14, the percent of illness should be dropping as we get out of the flu season. And that's the typical range that we see. And we can see here, the observed in yellow, and then when we hit a certain amount outside of that range, that shows an atypical disease pattern. And of course, this doesn't require any testing, no serological data, as soon as the temperatures taken, this is uploaded to the database. And during this point, there was isolation measures that were put in place, and we can see an immediate drop. And we can see here, in a way, that we can see the response to public policy. The article goes on to quote, Mr. Singh, the CEO of Kinza, in the example above, Singh says that the spike in the fever's coincides with reports of Miami residents and tourists ignoring guidance around recommended distancing. The steep drop-off, however, follows after more extreme measures, including beach closure and other isolation tactics were adopted in the area. Singh says that there regularly seeing that areas where residents are ignoring social distancing are seeing spikes. And that as soon as those are implemented via lockdowns and other measures within five days of those aggressive actions, you begin to see downward dips in the curve. And it's interesting to note that we know from other data that five days is about the median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2. They're not actually testing for COVID-19 with temperature, but as is pointed out, fever is a key and early symptom of COVID-19. So bear that in mind. I wanted to take this to a bird's eye view. And if this represents the total population, then obviously not the whole population is going to be infected. There is some debate on exactly what percent of the population is going to be infected with COVID-19. But let's say it represents it by this, we'll call this infection. And there are a number of issues that could make this proportion go up or go down. And we know some of the things that they're employing right now to allow it to go down social distancing or isolation or even some medications that would be called prophylaxis. Prophylaxis is a medication that would prevent the infection. We don't have anything that's FDA approved, but that's where it would go at this point. So what are things that could make the number of people with infection go up that would be apathy or just carelessness? We're trying to do social distancing, isolation, to reduce the number of people in the population that might get the infection. And that's important because what we have over here, if you can imagine that these bars are on wheels, is we're trying to get these car trains, if you will, through a tunnel that has a capacity for the healthcare system. And there are certain things that will increase the capacity of the healthcare system and there are certain things that will decrease the capacity. And we'll get to that. But there's one other intermediate step that really has not been looked at that seriously. And that is this car right here. We don't know exactly how tall these are, they're not drawn to scale. But these are the people here from the infection that will be going to the hospital. They will be going in through the tunnel. Hopefully they are short of them, the tunnel, otherwise there's going to be a problem. So what are the things that are going to increase the height of the tunnel that will allow it to go inside? Personal protective equipment on healthcare workers that allows the capacity to be higher because they're able to do more. Meaning ventilators that would increase the capacity of the healthcare system. Medications. Not only clinical trials to see what medications are appropriate, but also the manufacturer and the delivering of those medications are going to be key as well. Well, what would decrease this? Well, if healthcare workers had to be quarantined because they didn't have personal protective equipment, or if there is no PPE, either because people are taking the masks or they're just not enough masks for healthcare workers to use. And so where we are seeing a lot of resources spent right now is for the development of the making of personal protective equipment. We are getting the government involved in trying to convince manufacturers to make more ventilators. The FDA is waiting for these clinical trials to be completed so that it can decide whether or not it's going to indicate those medications for use in COVID-19. But of course, we have other medications that haven't been labeled for use in COVID-19. And we're using those as off label at this point because there are no medications that are FDA approved for COVID-19. And we are starting to get manufacturers to make a lot more medication. So we have focused a lot of energy in trying to get this tunnel increased in size because we know that there's a lot of people coming down the pike. There's going to be quite a number of people going through. And as it turns out, we know that about 20 percent of the people that become infected will end up needing to go to the hospital to get hospitalization. About 80 percent of those will simply have a mild case. So 80 percent no hospitalization. What's happening over here? Well, we're having a lot of time and effort being put into social distancing, isolation and things of that nature. So up to this point, this is where we've seen most of the effort being made to handle this situation with COVID-19. And the question remains, what else can we do? And may I suggest to you that where we need to be focusing as well is on this center section. So the question really boils down to, well, why is it that 80 percent of an infection will not need to go to the hospital? And the answer is very simple. The answer is your immune system. And the reason why we know that's the case is because people who are older have more comorbidities, typically have weaker immune systems. Those that are younger typically have stronger immune systems. And that's exactly what we're seeing in this situation. Other folks tend to be the ones that need to go to the hospital. That's not a big surprise. There are exceptions, of course, all the way up and down. There are young people that end up going to the hospital and there's elderly people who will become sick but then recover on their own. But by and large, the 20 percent that end up at the hospital have a lower immune system generally. And so in fact, the way that this box gets increased is if you have a bad immune system. And the way that this comes down is if you have a good immune system. And not much resources as of yet has been put into making sure that we have a good immune system. And I think this is a good area to look at because if you had a good immune system here to prevent you from going to the hospital, it also can work that a good immune system here might have prevented you from getting the illness in the first place. And so I think having a good immune system is of paramount importance. And there's two reasons why that's the case because for you personally, if you're able to improve your immune system, then you're not going to the hospital. But even more important, if you're not going to the hospital, that means the hospital doesn't need to deal with you and can concentrate their efforts on somebody else. Now notice that we're dealing with about an 80 and 20 percent differential there. That means if we can just improve the immune system by a short amount, in other words, if we can improve the immune system instead of 80 percent go to 85 percent. So that 85 percent don't need to go to the hospital. That means this 20 percent drops to 15 percent. That's actually a 25 percent drop in hospital admissions, which would be a massive impact at the hospital level. And of course, we're all hoping that if we can reduce this, then we can finally slip this car right into the tunnel without a problem. Hopefully all of these things working together, social distancing, isolation, a good immune system, medications delivered when they need to be personal protective equipment, ventilators, clinical trials, yielding good medications, all of these things can work together so that when we have the peak hit, we're able to take care of all the patients that we need to take care of. There are two components to your immune system. There is something called the innate and the specific. The innate portion of your immune system is made up of components of the white blood cells, which are the soldiers of your military immune system that basically indiscriminately take anything that's foreign and destroy them. It doesn't need to have specific knowledge of specific antigens. That's why it's known as innate. Whereas the specific has to be taught and shown specifically what the foreign antigen is so it can make antibodies against that specific and foreign antigen. So if you have here a pathogen, when the pathogen comes, it must penetrate through the innate immune system first. Now what are the components of the innate system? You have things called natural killer cells. You have macrophages. These are cells that eat up the foreign substance, munch it up and take little pieces of it, and then present it to the specific portion of the immune system so that they can see what parts of it look like and then make sure that they can identify it later, also neutrophils. They're part of that innate system. And so generally what happens is you have a pathogen. It gets eaten up by either natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils. The macrophage is generally speaking, take pieces of it and present it to the specific arm. That's called an antigen presenting cell. That's a macrophage. And there are two types of cells here. There are T cells and there are B cells. And generally speaking, the T cells are the things that are involved with cell mediated immunity where there are cells that are problems and these T cells can kill them. There's T4 helper cells which can help communicate as well. The B cells, on the other hand, secrete antibodies, which neutralize antigens. Be aware of that. What is going on around the world? There is something called the BCG vaccine. Now the BCG vaccine is given in various parts of the world, an injection that's given in young children to protect them from tuberculosis, even though it's not tuberculosis. There is a crossover between the vaccine and the innate immune system's response to tuberculosis. The reason why they're doing this in different parts of the world is because they've noticed that when they give the BCG vaccine to young individuals, not only do these young individuals have a natural killer cell macrophage, neutrophil response or the innate response, they also have a specific response against it which is helpful in trying to kill tuberculosis. But they've also noticed something else. It seems as though the specific arm of the immune system is talking to the innate after it gets revved up with the vaccination and it's using a carrier called IL-1 beta. Now when this happens, it not only revs up the specific but it revs up the innate as well to the point where when they give the BCG vaccine, they're noticing a reduction of 30 percent in viral infections. Now there were some criticisms of this study. But by 2016, a review was done that was published in the British Medical Journal that showed that there was an excess reduction in mortality after the BCG vaccine was given that couldn't be explained solely by the prevention of tuberculosis. So more studies since 2016 had confirmed that this is what it is that's going on. In fact, it culminated in a study where they gave the BCG vaccine and they noticed that it protected against a completely different pathogen, the yellow fever virus. And a weakened form which is also seen as a vaccination. Something that was new and interesting was that when you stimulated the specific arm of the immune system, it also stimulated the innate arm. And so therefore if you could rev up the immune system by giving a specific antigen that may be not even related to the thing you're trying to protect against, that a boosted innate immune system could be protective against another virus. And that's exactly what they're hoping on doing here with COVID-19. And so there's a number of studies all across the world, including Greece, in the Netherlands, in Australia, and in the UK that's looking at giving the BCG vaccine to elderly population and high-risk people like physicians, nurses, healthcare workers, etc. And if they can give them the BCG vaccine, they're hoping that the innate immunity will go up enough that they might not get the infection. I'll put a link in the description below to the article describing this technique. Can a century old TB vaccine steal the immune system against a new coronavirus? But you can see here on this graph, we're looking at the areas in red, as we mentioned. The other area that we should look at is the areas in green, even if it helps a little bit. A lot of the problems that we're having over here in red is the system trying to get the PPE out to enough hospitals that they can use it. Our medications, we're having shortages trying to get enough of these things out to the hospital. So we'll ask a different question. What are some things that we can do without having to worry about a healthcare delivery system that can improve our immune system? So for future updates, we're going to take a look at the data of things that can improve your immune system. Okay, thanks for joining us.

Coronavirus Pandemic Update 76: Antibody Testing False Positives in COVID-19,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-05-28,NSRK41UbTEU,"Welcome to another Meg Cram COVID-19 update. We take a quick look at the states in the United States with the highest deaths per million population. We'll see them listed here with New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts. These are basically the states of the Northeast. And as we go down, we'll run into this USA total, which is kind of the average. And below that, we have those states that are below average, at least at this point. If we take a look at Canada, we see that the daily new cases are starting to drop off, as are the daily deaths in Canada. There's been some concern made about what's going on in Brazil. However, we see that the amount of cases have stopped increasing at least at this point in Brazil. Or we can at least say that they have stabilized. And as we put it all together for the entire world, we can see or try to imagine that there is perhaps some sort of a leveling off there in terms of total deaths. But total cases seem to be rather linearly increasing. So let's take a little bit closer look at that. Let's go back to New York, which had the highest cases per million. So if any state is approaching herd immunity, and I'm not saying that, they've gotten there yet. But any state would be there. It would be New York. As we can see there, the daily new cases has dropped off. That may be because of weather. It may be because of physical distance, and that people are keeping away from each other. It's going to be interesting to see what happens here with opening, and whether or not these numbers increase towards the end of the fall and going into winter. And speaking of herd immunity, let's talk a little bit about antibodies. Recently, there was this article that was published by CNN Health titled, Anabody Test for COVID-19 Wrong Up to Half the Time, the CDC says. And if you go to their website at the CDC, there is an article, Interim Guidelines for COVID-19 Anabody Testing. And we'll cover that in just a second. But let's go back to the CNN article and all boils down to this line. They say in a population where the prevalence is 5 percent, which is what it probably generally is in a number of places in the United States, a test with 90 percent sensitivity and 95 percent specificity will yield a positive predictive value of 49 percent. In other words, less than half of those testing positive will truly have antibodies. That's a real problem because there's a lot of false positives with that. So what is going on and how can we best understand that? Well, to best understand it, you've got to understand exactly how we look at this as an epidemiologist or a medical student studying epidemiology. So let's go back to medical school. And the way that we typically look at this is we make a nice 2x2 square. And there's two possibilities. You either have the disease or you don't have the disease. You then we look at tests and we look at the specific test result. And either you test positive or you don't. So if you have the disease and you test positive for the disease, that's known as a true positive. If you test positive for the disease and you don't that's known as a false positive. If you have the disease and you test negative that's known as a false negative. And if you don't have the disease and you test negative, that's known as a true negative. So what we wanna do is let's pretend that we take a town in America, and let's say this town is a small town, it only has 2100 people in the population. And we test everybody in the population. But the key here is that this is early on in the pandemic. And so the prevalence of this disease is only 5 percent. So if the prevalence is only 5 percent, that means 100 people in the town have the disease and 2,000 people in the town don't have the disease. Now, in addition to this, I wanna say that we are going to use a test that has a sensitivity of 90 percent and a specificity of 95 percent. So what does that mean exactly? Sensitivity and specificity. Well, that has to do with people who have the disease and people who don't have the disease. What do I mean by that? If a test is 90 percent sensitive, that means that the number of true positives divided by the number of people that have the disease in total is gonna be 90 percent. Specificity has to do with those that don't have the disease. And what it says is those that are true negatives divided by the total number of people that don't have the disease are gonna be 95 percent. So we can back calculate and figure out that the number that goes in here is 90, that this is 10, that this is 100, and this is 1900. So let's do the math. 90 divided by the total number, which is 100, is 90 percent. That's the sensitivity. Notice that as the sensitivity goes up, the false negatives go down. And if the false negatives go down, that would mean that if you were to get a negative test result, it's most likely gonna be a true negative. Now, conversely, let's look at the specificity. The specificity here is 95 percent. What does that mean? That means that the true negatives divided by the total number of negatives is 95 percent. Notice that when the specificity goes up, the number of false positives goes down. So that means if you end up getting a positive on a test, the chances are it's gonna be a true positive. And so because of that, you can say that if something is very sensitive and it's negative, you can rule it out. But if something is very specific and it's positive, then you can rule it in. So these are our test characteristics, and we're gonna use those again. Let's take another snapshot of the same town except a number of months later when more people have contracted the disease and the prevalence in the population has gone up. Instead of being 5 percent like it was in our first example, now we're going to look at a prevalence of 52 percent. Still, the town has 2100 people, and again, we're gonna be looking at the same thing, disease. You either have it or you don't, and testing, you either are positive or you're negative. Well, because 52 percent of the people of 2100 have the disease, we can now know that instead of just 100 people having the disease, we have 1,094 people having the disease. And therefore, we have 1,06 people that don't have the disease. Well, again, we're gonna be using the same characteristics of sensitivity of 90 percent and specificity of 95 percent, and so we can fill in the numbers. Again, this is true positive, false positive, false negative, true negative. And the numbers go like this, 985 and 109, 50 and 956. If you take 985 and divide it by 1,094, you're gonna get the sensitivity of the test, which is still 90 percent. If you take 956 and divide it by 1,06, you're gonna get the specificity of the test, which is still 95 percent. And so the sensitivity and the specificity has not changed in the first graph or the second graph. But the thing is, is when you order a test on a patient, you don't really care necessarily what the sensitivity is or the specificity, what you're interested in is if I get a positive result, what does this mean for this patient? And also, if I get a negative result, what does this mean for this patient? In other words, if I get a positive or negative result, what are the chances that this patient either has or doesn't have the disease? To answer that question, you need to know the positive and negative predictive values. The positive predictive value and the negative predictive value. So in other words, the positive predictive value is given a positive test result, what are the chances that this patient actually has the disease? And given a negative test result, what are the chances that this patient doesn't have this disease? Well, to do that, you actually have to go horizontal. And so the positive predictive value is actually this number, the true positives, divided by the total number of positives. And the negative predictive value is the true negatives, divided by all of the negatives. So let's write that down. In this case here, the positive predictive value is going to be 90 divided by 190, in which case that equals 47 percent. But if we look at the negative predictive value in this one, then it's 1900, divided by 1910, which is a very high 99 percent. So when the prevalence is low at 5 percent, if you get a negative result on your antibody testing, there is a very good chance that it's a true negative. However, if you get a positive result, when the prevalence in the population of COVID-19 is only 5 percent, then your positive predictive value, the chances that you actually have really, truly antibodies against COVID-19, is only 47 percent. And the reason why that's the case is because there's such a high amount of false positives. The way you want to get the false positives down, as we talked about, is by picking a very specific test. And in this case, the specificity is only 95 percent. What you need is a specificity test of much higher value in order to have a positive predictive value, that's worth anything at all in this population. But now to show you how prevalence affects positive predictive value, we're now going to go to our 52 percent prevalent population and do exactly the same thing. So in this case, we're going to take 985 and divide it by the total number of positives. Which is 1,035. And in this case, the positive predictive value is 95 percent. What does that mean? That when the prevalence is higher at 52 percent, instead of just 5 percent, and you get a positive value, and you're using exactly the same test, now you're much more confident that this positive test result actually means that you really do have antibodies against the virus. And the negative predictive value, again, is 956 true negatives, divided by the total number of negatives, which in this case is 1,065. So when you do that, your negative predictive value is 90 percent. Actually lower than it was when there was less prevalence. So what we've just discovered here is that prevalence determines positive and negative predictive values. A high prevalence will increase the positive predictive value. A low prevalence will increase the negative predictive value. So if we're in a situation like this, as we are right now, where there's a low prevalence, as it stands here, in May of 2020, then the way to improve positive predictive value is to pick a test with a very high specificity. So let's go back to the CDC website and see if what they're saying makes sense. And it says that the utility of tests depends on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assays. These performance characteristics are determined by using a defined set of negative and positive samples. In addition, the predictive values of a test should be considered because these values affect the overall outcome of testing. Positive predictive value that's going across horizontally is the probability that individuals with positive test results are truly antibody positive, whereas negative predictive value is the probability that individuals with negative test results are truly antibody negative. Positive and negative predictive values are determined by the percentage of truly antibody positive individuals in the tested population. Now, notice what they say here, in a high prevalence setting, that would be the one on the right that we did. The positive predictive value increases, that's exactly what we found, meaning it is more likely that persons who test positive are truly antibody positive. Then if the test is performed in a population with low prevalence, remember that was the one on the left. When a test is used in a population where the prevalence is low, the positive predictive value drops because there are far more false positive results since the pre-test probability is low. What do they say we should do? Let's look at testing strategies. Three strategies can be used to improve the positive predictive value. Choosing a test with a very high specificity, perhaps 99.5 percent or greater, will yield a high positive predictive value in populations tested with prevalence greater than 5 percent. That's exactly what we just said. The other thing you'd like to do is to focus your attention on testing people that have what they call a high pre-test probability. For instance, our medical group is testing people in high pre-test probability. If they have a limited number of tests, they're not going to be testing people who don't have a high incidence of the disease by, for instance, seeing people who may not be interacting with patients who have COVID-19, but instead testing intensive care physicians and hospitalists who are actually working in a COVID-19 unit. That would be the population with a higher prevalence, and therefore, it would make more sense to use antibody testing in that population. I'll let you read the rest of this article on the CDC website. It actually gives some very good information in terms of persons who test positive for anti-SARS COV-2 antibodies. Hey, guys, I wanted to tell you about a recent interview that I did with Dr. Rishi Desai. So check it out. We'll put a link in the description below. Okay, thanks for joining us, and don't forget to see all of our MedCram videos at our website, MedCram.com. We'll see you next time."
Coronavirus Pandemic Update 78: Mask Controversy; Vaccine Update for COVID-19,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-06-01,_IrYyhufDwI,"Welcome to another Meg Kram COVID-19 update. Really quickly looking at the United States, daily new cases seem to continue to slowly head down. And also this is mirrored in the daily destiny of the United States as a whole. However, in some states like California, we've seen some of our highest cases on a daily basis, just recently. Daily deaths also really hasn't come down much either. New York is still the state with the most amount of infections. However, their daily new cases has really come down. And that has also mirrored in the daily deaths in New York state. However, in some states like Texas, again, we haven't seen really much of a decrease. Looking around the world, Brazil has really taken off in terms of daily new cases, and that's a situation that we'll be looking at. And of course, Brazil have the deaths to go along with that. Fortunately, we're seeing in Russia kind of a leveling off of the surge that they had in the last few weeks. And because deaths are usually lagging behind, we may be starting to see a decrease in that too. Of course, India, being a very large country of about 1.3 billion, is also starting to see an increase in daily new cases, now almost approaching 10,000 cases a day. And they also have the daily death rate to go with that as well. So things to keep an eye on. Of course, we're keeping an eye on Australia because they are headed into winter so far so good. There's been some recent discussion about face masks or face coverings, cloth face coverings, and whether or not it should be mandatory to wear it or not. And you may recall early on in February, the Surgeon General was telling us not to get face masks. I think at this point, the major organizations like the CDC and the WHO have sort of landed in their respective areas in terms of their recommendation on wearing face masks. So you can see here, the CDC has definitely come down on the side of the use of cloth face coverings. They say here, your cloth face covering may protect them and their cloth face covering may protect you. And we will put a link to this article in the description below. And basically, what they're saying here is that the virus can spread asymptomatically when people are just talking with each other. And so they say because of this evidence, the CDC is recommending wearing face coverings in public settings where you might meet in grocery stores and pharmacies, et cetera, et cetera. Now, this is a little bit different than what is going on over at the WHO. And here's the link for that. You can see World Health Organization. And you can see here, it says, if you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you're taking care of a person with COVID-19. You can wear a mask if you're coughing or sneezing, et cetera. So why is there a difference between these two recommendations? And it may have to do with the fact that the WHO is also in a fact for people in countries who can't afford universal face masks. And if everyone started to go out and get the face masks, then they may not have enough for the healthcare providers who are taking care of patients with COVID-19. Now I wanted to show you some interesting research that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Visualizing Speech Generated Oral Fluid Droplets with Laser Light Scattering. And I want to show you what the difference is between wearing a mask and not wearing a mask in terms of the droplets that you see with laser light scattering. Let's take a look at the video. So here it is without a mask. Now I'm recording. Stay healthy. Great. Stay healthy. Great. Less loud. Stay healthy. Do it. Are you recording? Yeah. Stay healthy. Lowder. Stay healthy. Lowder. Stay healthy. Stay healthy. Stay healthy. Lowder. Stay healthy. Lowder. Stay healthy. Stay healthy. Stay healthy. Nothing. So you can see perhaps why the CDC is recommending when you're in the store going out in the public. You may want to continue to wear face mask. The next thing I want to talk about is this website. Now we've used a number of websites in our regular COVID-19 updates like the Johns Hopkins and the World Dometer. I think as we go forward, this is going to be a regular one that we're going to look at because it's talking about something that we're looking forward to and that is a vaccine. So this is put on by wraps.org and wraps stands for regulatory affairs, professional society. And what this is is a COVID-19 vaccine tracker. So this is a really nice way of looking. I basically just showed 50 entries and I clicked trial phase and you can see here they've got the candidate name, the sponsor, what trial phase that they're in, the name of the institution and the amount of funding that's going in. You can search this. Currently there's about 28 of these on here. So they're not all here but you can see, we'll talk about Moderna. We'll come back to them about what phase they're in phase one there you can see. But here's an mRNA lipid nanoparticle. Here's a COVID-19 S-trimer with various adjuvant candidates. Here's another mRNA. This is the one that we know we've talked about before Moderna. So phase one is looking at safety phase two is looking at ramping it up in terms of size and safety and phase three, of course, is the randomized control trial right before FDA approval. Some of these are preclinical as you can see. So when you get to one that you want to know more about like the Moderna one, you can just click on this and it'll expand. They'll tell you all about the background. There's even links to outcome phase one data in this case. And so they will be updating this website every week or so. So here's the relevant information for the Moderna mRNA, the one we've been looking at here. But we can look at a number of these. It always goes back to the default which is showing 10 entries. So if you just click 50 and click phase trial, you'll be able to see which ones you want to see. This one here which is in phase two slash three is the BCG ones. Take a look at that one. And this was done to prevent tuberculosis, of course. And we talked about this in previous Medcram updates where there may be some added effects against the coronavirus with these BCG vaccines. And we showed that that paper that was published from a university in Texas. It was a non peer reviewed paper posted in March on the preprint server Med Archive suggested that countries with BCG vaccination programs that childhood are faring better in the fight against COVID-19 compared to countries that didn't. And if we click on fairing better, we come to that paper that we talked about before. And you can see it. So I think this is a really nice clearing house for the vaccines that are currently underway. And if you want to research those, this is a really nice resource. I also wanted to let you know that Sunday night we did our very first live stream on the Medcram YouTube channel. And we'll be planning on doing this on a weekly basis. Generally Sunday nights, we'll see how things go. But yeah, we were getting questions from the audience and it was a very nice interactive session. And we look forward to doing that more often. Also wanted to remind you all that we are active at Medcram.com where we have many different other topics other than COVID-19 for those who are interested in topics such as asthma, COPD, congestive heart failure, EKG, vasopressure, CBC, mechanical ventilation, a whole difference array of other conditions that are relevant in terms of treatment of COVID-19. So join us at Medcram.com. Thanks for joining us."
"Coronavirus Pandemic Update 79: COVID-19 Vaccines to Keep an Eye On - mRNA, Antigen, Others",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-06-04,-dYWZMx-Lfs,"Welcome to another Meg Cram COVID-19 update. Last time we talked about vaccines and the different phases that they were in, and we will refer you to this vaccine tracker. What I wanted to do was narrow it down a little bit more into about five vaccines to keep your eye on in the future. It's these five that have the most likely chance of being available in the early part of 2021. The first one is the one by Moderna. It's the mRNA 1273. This one's a special one in that it's an mRNA vaccine, which means that the mRNA is going to be put into person's body, and that's going to generate the protein, which then will generate the immune response. Now you have to remember that there are three phases to any kind of drug trial or vaccine. Phase one is a safety issue. Phase two looks a little bit more at dosing, and then phase three is the pivotal trial, if you will, where the actual data comes out to see whether or not it's working. They've already gotten into phase two trials here on the 29th of May, and the phase three trials are expected to start in the early summer. So they're already on pretty good time tracks. The next vaccine is the University of Oxford vaccine here. This vaccine is looking at a different type of virus. It's an Adenovirus vaccine vector, but it's going to inject the epitope or the antigen into the patient. This team has actually come together and made the MERS vaccine in the past. So this is a pretty promising group, and they already started recruitment for phase two three trials here on May 22nd. And so this is another one to be looking for. Here's the third one, Johnson and Johnson. They're still in preclinical trials, and they are estimating that phase one trials are going to start in September of 2020. The fourth one is Merck. They're also in preclinical, and they are using technology that's allowed them to come up with the Ebola vaccine. And finally, the last one is Pfizer. This is also looking at an mRNA-based vaccine. And this has already been in phase one in two trials since April 22nd. Of course, the one that's gotten the most media attention is the one from Moderna. What's interesting about this study is that the FDA gave permission to the regulatory body to allow Moderna to start doing these trials without safety data from animals first. As you can see here in this article, titled Researchers Brush to Test Coronavirus Vaccine in People Without Knowing How Well It Works in Animals, this article talks about some of the ethics involved with that, and realizing that this is how we're able to get these vaccines so quickly. And if you want to hear more about vaccines and what we're doing with them in COVID-19, I wanted you to know about a live symposium that we're having today on Med IQ, I plan on being with Dr. DeSai, and there will be a link in the description below. So quick video today, and we'll see you live this afternoon. Please subscribe to this channel if you haven't already, and hit that bell icon so you can get notified when we release the new video. Thanks for joining us."
Coronavirus Pandemic Update 96: RNA Vaccine; Ivermectin; von Willebrand Factor and COVID-19,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-07-15,kk7KNBak-i0,"We haven't looked at Canada in a long time and seems as though they've avoided a lot of these recent spikes and their daily deaths continue to be at new lows since the pandemic broke. The big news of the day of course is Moderna's RNA vaccine which we'll talk about in a little bit. Before we get to that though, I wanted to talk a little bit about thrombosis as we were talking about before and some new research that's come out in terms of Ivermectin as well. First of all, let's talk about thrombosis real quick. And as most of you know who are regulars on MedCram, you'll know what we've talked about in terms of the hypothesis which was that SARS-CoV-2 hits the endothelial cells which causes a reduction in ACE2 and that causes an increase in angiotensin-2, a reduction in angiotensin-1-7 which leads to reactive oxygen species in the form of superoxide in this case that causes endothelial cell dysfunction which causes an increase in Von Willibrand's factor leading to thrombosis. Well it seems as though this idea and hypothesis is now being picked up fortunately at a number of centers around the world. Here's one for instance from Russia at the State University at St. Petersburg State University. A senior research associate named Anna Axinova is reported to be advancing a hypothesis that severe course of COVID-19 may be associated with the Von Willibrand factor, one of the main components of the blood coagulation system. And this article goes on to report that the replication of the virus stimulates a development of micro damage on the vessel walls and in response to this the body releases Von Willibrand factor into the blood trying to patch possible holes and as a result the risk of thrombosis increases. And as we talked about it says here, to date the way in which the level of Von Willibrand is regulated in the blood has not yet been fully studied. However it is known to be stored in vascular endothelial cells in special organelles where it secretes in the form of multimmers as soon as some damage to the vessel occurs that in order to eliminate it a cascade of blood coagability is launched in the body in which Von Willibrand factor takes an active part. They also go on to talk about how this is affected by different blood groups which were seeing the ABO system affecting also mortality in Von Willibrand. So there may be a connection there as we've brought up before. She goes on to say, I hypothesize that the level and activity of Von Willibrand factor might be important predictors of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and might also itself be involved in the disease process. In order to confirm this hypothesis it is necessary to carry a large scale and comprehensive research into the level and activity of Von Willibrand factor in people affected with SARS-CoV-2 who have mild or severe course of infection. Well I'm so glad that people are looking at this because I also believe that this is one potential reason why this is happening. Here's another group from thrombosis research that will be published next month 2020 and this article is titled targeting raised Von Willibrand factor levels and macrophage activation in severe COVID-19. Consider low volume plasma exchange and low dose steroids. Basically what they're talking about in this article is that because of Von Willibrand factor is such a very large protein that you really can't get it out of the system. They say here that large size, high molecular weight Von Willibrand factor multimers which are on the order of 5,000 to 10,000 kilo-adultons in size are so big that the only way to really get them out is through something called plasma exchange. What they found before was that plasma Von Willibrand factor levels reduce after plasma exchange so they say that potentially in the severe patient's plasma exchange may actually be beneficial in getting these multimers down and preventing thrombosis. And here's another article that was published in June of 2020 titled micro-thrombotic complications of COVID-19 are likely due to embolism of circulating endothelial derived ultra-large Von Willibrand factor decorated platelet strings kind of like beads on a string. And you can read the letter below. But here's the key point. Endothelial derived ULVWF's multimers anchored to the endothelial surface of the vascular wall recruit platelets and initiate micro-thrombogenesis within the micro-vascular, leading to large micro-thrombi. Strings composed of platelets and again these Von Willibrand factor complexes like beads on a string structures where platelets firmly adhere to these Von Willibrand factors instead of roll on the strings. Platelets once adhered to these strings are rapidly activated causing platelet aggregation and also recruit leukocytes, remember what we talked about in our last update that they saw quite a number of mega-cario sites associated with this. These aggregates grow until they become sufficiently large and can no longer be held onto the strings against the force of blood flow and released from endothelial cells into circulation. It appears to us that in COVID-19, micro-thrombotic disease, large amounts of circulating complexes of endothelial derived ULVWF's decorated platelet micro-thrombi strains are filtered in the micro-vascular as an embolism that means they move until they can't move anymore or develops in the micro-vascular inside to that means right where they are causing micro-thrombotic occlusion and this is what causes our hypoxemia without stiff lungs. If you want to go back and see the MEG crème video where we talk about this that was published back in early May, go to update 67 of course we'll put a link in the description below. So I'm really glad that they're looking at this because I think this could be a definite possibility. However, I want to introduce another possible reason why there could be blood clots and that is connected to Ivermectin and then of course we're going to talk about Moderna's RNA vaccine here in just a second. So here's a paper that has been released but not peer-reviewed titled Ivermectin for COVID-19 treatment. Clinical response at quasi-threshold doses via hypothesized alleviation of CD147 mediated vascular occlusion. So this is interesting because CD147 is a protein that is on the red blood cell. Red blood cells of course are found in blood clots as well as thrombin and fibron etc. But you may recognize CD147 as being the entry point for malaria into the red blood cell. Well as it turns out, as we've talked about before, the CD147 protein is also considered by some binding site for the spike protein on SARS-CoV-2. Now of course this doesn't really help the virus if it goes into a red blood cell because well there's no nucleus in a red blood cell and if there's no nucleus then there doesn't need to be any ribosomes, at least they mature red blood cells because there's no protein synthesis occurring. If there's no protein synthesis occurring the virus can't replicate. So red blood cells are kind of a dead end target because they're not going to be able to reproduce themselves in a red blood cell. They can only do that in a cell that has the machinery to reproduce. It would be like somebody hijacking a plane with no fuel or engines in it. It's not going to go anywhere. However, the problem may be that these virus, at least the theory goes that the virus binds the CD147 and tends to make these cells sticky and accumulate and cause thrombosis and that's what this article is talking about. And for that I want to jump down here to the third paragraph. They say here the proposed catch and clump scenario for COVID-19 has a parallel in malaria as we just talked about CD147 is central to the infectious process of malaria into the red blood cell. But what is it that's happening in COVID-19? Well for that let's go to the second paragraph and they say here the potential for major dose response gains is evaluated based on studies indicating that Iver Mectin shields SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and that this spike protein is supposed to be able to bind of CD147 but Iver Mectin prevents this from happening. It also potentially prevents it from binding to the ACE2 receptor. Now, because of the abundant distribution of the CD147 on red blood cells, it's not going to be able to bind to the red blood cell and it prevents therefore this hypothesized catch and clump framework. So catch and clump meaning the virus catches the red blood cells by 147 and then causes this clumping to occur which may be the basis for this thrombosis. They say here this framework whereby virally mediated bindings of red blood cells to other red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells and capillary walls impede the blood flow which in term may underlie key morbidities of COVID-19. The reason why this is important they believe is because Iver Mectin may actually prevent not only this catching and clumping but it may also prevent infection of the virus into cells where they can cause replication and why do they believe that? Well, this again is not a peer reviewed study and in fact it's not even a prospective study but in a retrospective study and of course retrospective studies have all sorts of problems with them and biases but nevertheless a retrospective study. Starting at Iver Mectin showed that in a study of 173 COVID-19 patients treated with IVM or Iver Mectin in four Florida hospitals at a dose of 200 micrograms per kilogram yielded a 40 percent reduction in mortality compared to 107 controls and that stabilization then improvement over one to two days frequently occurred for patients who had a rapidly deteriorating oxygen status. Now previously in our updates we talked about the modality of Iver Mectin and how it potentially inhibited the nuclear transport system of converting and transporting viral proteins into the nucleus of the cell. This is a brand new and novel theory that is suggesting that Iver Mectin actually interferes with the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the receptor not only on the cells that might cause viral replication but also on the red blood cells which don't. The importance here being of course with red blood cells is that they may be the basis for this clotting in patients. Now the thing that we have to remember of course again is this was a retrospective study and not a prospective study. Here is a great article in nature that looked at Iver Mectin a systematic review from antiviral effects to COVID-19 complimentary regimen. So what is the use of Iver Mectin in COVID-19? This tries to look at the relevant data not only in COVID-19 but other viruses as well and it's a great reference and of course we'll make a reference to it in the description below. But what does it have to say about COVID-19? They say here Iver Mectin owing to its antiviral activity may play a pivotal role in several essential biological processes therefore could serve as a potential candidate in the treatment of different types of viruses including COVID-19. However, clinical trials are necessary to appraise the effects of Iver Mectin on COVID-19 in the clinical setting and this warrants additional investigation for probable benefits in humans in the current and future pandemics. Notice they say here that on April 10, 2020 the FDA issued a statement concerning self-administration of Iver Mectin against COVID-19 referring to recently published in vitro study on the subject. So notice what they say here because the in vitro study on the subject looked at the dosages and those are noted down here because the type of range in the in vitro study is in the microgram range, microgram. Here, the blood levels of Iver Mectin at safe therapeutic dosages in patients is really in the nanogram per milliliter range. And so this rings up the question about can we really take the in vitro studies and make them beneficial in the in vivo state. In other words, what's going on in the test tube in vitro is that really what's going on in vivo and it looks as though you have to get pretty high concentrations at least in these in vitro studies that may not be possible at least in a safe range in human beings. It doesn't mean it can't happen but it means that we need to test these results in actual patients prospectively to see whether or not it's going to work. Okay, let's talk about the big news of the day. And for that, we turn to stat news. First data for Moderna COVID-19 vaccine show its spurs and immune response. I just want to make sure everyone is reminded that I have no stock in Moderna and no financial connection to this company. So let's see what's going on. Basically all you need to know is right here in the first three lines. Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine led patients to produce antibodies that can neutralize the novel coronavirus, though it caused minor side effects in many patients, according to the first published data from an early stage trial of the experimental shot. Well where was it published? It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. So let's take a look at that article. And here is that article titled an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 preliminary report. Now remember this is important to understand that this mRNA vaccine is really unlike any other one that has been done before. Here you're not introducing a protein into the patient so that they can make antibodies against it and have memory made against it. No, here we're introducing a messenger RNA which will go into your native cells and that messenger RNA much like the coronavirus will cause the machinery of your cell to produce the protein, that is a foreign protein that will cause the immunogenic response and that will cause the antibodies. So because this was an early trial, early in terms of phase one, phase two, here what they're trying to do is figure out how much of this vaccine needs to be given to have an adequate immune response without having too many side effects. It's too small, it won't have a very good immunogenic response. If it's too large, you could have some side effects. So it's trying to find the goldilocks if you will, right dose so that they can now after determining that, do a phase three trial where they are planning on starting that very shortly actually and see how that works in a much larger population but at the appropriate dose. So as you can see here what they did was they looked at a number of different dosages. They looked at the 25 microgram dose, the 100 or the 250 microgram dose and in fact there were 15 participants in each group. And basically the bottom line of this study and there's a lot of data in this study to go over and we might be looking at this over the next couple of updates but it's kind of exciting. The conclusion was is that the mRNA 1273 vaccine which is the vaccine that they're looking at induced in anti-SARS COVID-2 immune response in all participants and no trial limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine. Now if we look at the results here we can see the 25 microgram group, the 100 microgram group and the 250 microgram group and you can see here that over the number of days on each of those that the reciprocal endpoint titers did go up. And you can take a look at the rest of these here, I don't want to get into a lot of the details because it's very complicated. Suffice to say that at the end of the day what they noticed was that there was two injections that were necessary to get the response that they wanted. Here's a nice graph though about what I'm interested in as well which is what were the side effects in each of these dosages and after vaccination one and after vaccination two and here you can see things broken up pretty well where gray is a mild symptom, blue is a moderate symptom and this yellow is a severe symptom. So you can see here any systemic symptom for the most part you can see that there was a dose dependent relationship and it got worse after vaccination two in terms of arthralges, fatigue, fever, chills, headache, myalgia, nausea, any local symptom, size of erythema or redness or size of injuries or swelling or pain at the site. Generally speaking was fairly mild to moderate in vaccination one and usually worse in the higher 250 microgram dose. In vaccination two generally speaking there were more side effects and again worse in the 250 microgram dose group. And based on these results and also in terms of where the company wants to go the dose that they are going to look at going forward is the 100 microgram dose. As you can read here it says a large phase three efficacy trial expected to evaluate the 100 microgram dose is anticipated to begin during the summer of 2020 and I believe that is going to be starting this month. It'll be interesting to see how long the antibody response lasts and if things keep up the way they are we may have a vaccine here in the early part of 2021. I think the question of safety is still there. Sometimes the true level of safety doesn't come out until you get into phase three trials and indeed even in post marketing. And of course phase three is going to tell us whether or not this thing actually prevents people from getting coronavirus. Don't forget that if you want to follow other vaccines that are being developed for COVID-19 to follow at wraps.org which will leave a link in the description below. There they have not only the vaccine from Moderna but also the other ones for instance from the University of Oxford and also Pfizer etc. Coming up we're going to talk in future updates about the long haulers. These are people that seemingly have not recovered from their coronavirus infection. Not just in a couple of days or weeks but in some cases even up to months. And why is that happening? Also we're approaching our 100th update. Might be a good time to do a little retrospective review.

Coronavirus Pandemic Update 105: FDA Authorized Treatments; COVID 19 Vaccine Update,MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-09-01,01MRRop7OPs,"Welcome to another MedCram COVID-19 update. Daily new cases in the United States seems to be slowly decreasing if we look at the seven-day moving average. And the daily new deaths in the United States also seems to be slowly decreasing, especially if we look at the seven-day moving average, although it seems to have flattened and then decreased slightly. If we look at the current toolbox that we have for COVID-19, we've got arguably four items amongst many others. Remember that Remdesivir was given emergency use authorization from the FDA based on a study that showed that the time to recovery was reduced in that randomized controlled trial. It did not show a mortality benefit. But many people believe that if the study was taken out to its conclusion, in other words, if a thousand people as was planned was enrolled in the study, that that would have met statistical significance. Nevertheless, it didn't happen. There's been some news regarding that in that it's been broadened in its scope. More news on that later in this update. The second one was Dexamethasone, and they used it for about ten days in the study. This came out of the recovery trial in Great Britain. In this case, there actually was a survival benefit. In this case, it was six milligrams, either orally or intravenously, in these patients. I've been at the bedside taking care of these patients on a regular basis. There's a number of these patients that get better very quickly and are able to go home after about four or five days or even a week. We found that these patients who would benefit from Dexamethasone are the patients that are on oxygen. Very similar to the initial type of patients that were requiring Remdesivir. For Remdesivir, we would give these patients Remdesivir if they were requiring supplemental oxygen. Same thing in the recovery trial regarding Dexamethasone. These patients would come in, they would require oxygen. We would start them on Dexamethasone, and we would give it for ten days. Why? Because that's exactly the length of time that they used in the recovery trial. There were some patients that didn't get better. In fact, there's a lot of patients that stick around in the intensive care unit for days, even weeks, if you can believe it. Those of you out there that are listening to me that take care of COVID-19 patients know exactly what I'm talking about. There's a subset of patients. They get bad, they get worse, they get on the ventilator, and they stay there for in some cases weeks. Well, one of the things that I've noticed is that when we start these patients on ten days of Dexamethasone, there is an improvement in not only the clinical scenario, but also in a number of the blood tests that we check. What are those things that we check? One of those things that we check is a CRP. CRP stands for C-reactive protein, and it is a marker of inflammation going on in the body. Typically, we see that the CRP levels are very elevated initially, and then when we start them on Dexamethasone, then they start to come down showing a response. We see a very similar picture for patients with ferritin. Now, I know that ferritin has iron as opposed to CRP, and some people may think that that ferritin may actually work into the pathophysiology. I know there was some argument about that a few months ago that iron seemed to be the reason why patients were getting sick. No, in fact, ferritin is also an acute phase protein, and it's going to go up if there is inflammation going on. And again, typically, these patients have high ferritin levels, and when you start them on Decadron, it goes down. Number three is the LDH. This is also seen. We see LDH, which is an intra-cellular enzyme, and when cells are being broken down, and there's inflammation, we see LDH increase as well. Another one that we keep track of in these patients is the D-dimer. Now, D-dimers are little pieces of protein that is usually the byproduct of coagulation. And so this is a very rough way of determining if there is coagulation occurring in the human body. And so we would typically see these levels up because we know that there is an increased risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. But we don't yet know whether or not this is the B-all and the end-all of coagulation. In other words, some groups have put forward some evidence that would seem to indicate that the D-dimer isn't capturing everything. That may be the case, but nevertheless, in all of these situations, we see a pattern of high CRP, high ferritin, high LDH, and elevated D-dimer in these patients. And I'm sure you could add other factors in here as well. But in those patients where we're checking these on a daily basis, we can track their inflammatory pattern. And when these patients get put on Dexamethasone, which is a corticosteroid, we see that these numbers go down. They respond to the decadron. The problem is that these patients, these subset of patients that end up in the hospital for days, even weeks. At some point, when we put this order in for Dexamethasone to go for 10 days, what I've noticed anecdotally in a number of patients is that at the 10th day, the Dexamethasone stops. And because Dexamethasone has a fairly long half-life, it's not tapered off because when you stop the medication, it eventually wears off after a couple of days. If you look back at the recovery trial, they specifically didn't taper the Dexamethasone. But what I've invariably noticed in the patients that I've taken care of is that these markers start to go back up again. And it's not just numbers. It's not just we're looking at the LDH and the D-dimer. I'm also starting to see clinical evidence of deterioration after about 10 days and then stopping the Dexamethasone. And seeing these factors go back up again, what I'll also see as an evidence of that is that the FIO2, which is the amount of oxygen that we have to give these patients, also starts to go up. But I've seen these anecdotally in a number of patients to the point where I've made a mental note of that. And I'm very careful now at the end of 10 days to determine, is this patient going to benefit from stopping? I stop it and I watch very carefully, specifically looking at these numbers. Again, this is anecdotal evidence. I don't know whether or not there's a subsection of patients that may do better with a longer course, but I think it needs to be looked into. And this also brings up a wider point, which is, yeah, we know what medications in our toolbox are helpful against COVID-19. But the real science and the real art of taking care of patients in the intensive care unit is paying attention to detail, looking at all of those regular things that we look at in every patient who's in the intensive care unit. We look at their sodium concentration. We look at their potassium concentration. We look at their acid-based status, something that we call a chem-7. It looks like a little kind of a fishbone type of structure on a paper where we look at their sodium, their potassium, their chloride, their bicarbonate concentration, which is listed as CO2. We look at their BUN, and we look at their creatinine, basically their kidney function, and their glucose. To give you an example, when a patient is on the ventilator with COVID-19, they're breathing rapidly. In some cases, we have the ventilator set to 20 or 30 breaths per minute. And because of that, they're breathing out a lot of moisture. Well, that's a lot of free water loss. And so if you don't replace that, you're not careful. The total body concentration of just about everything, including the sodium, will start to rise. And you'll see this imperceptibly on a daily basis that if this patient is being dehydrated and not being replaced with free water, you'll start to see a sodium concentration, which is normally around 140 to 145, goes as high as 150 or even higher. And so what you need to do is to be able to, first of all, pick this up and to be able to replace that free water. Otherwise, the patient's going to be very uncomfortable and you could start getting dehydration and worsening kidney function. And so because this diligent attention to detail in the intensive care unit is so important, we've put together a course on monitoring this chem seven and it's going to be premiering very shortly on our MedCram.com platform. And this is intended for healthcare providers who are taking care of patients in the outpatient setting, in the inpatient setting, and in the intensive care unit. How fast should you correct sodium? What are the correct medications for bringing down potassium? What is the meaning of a low or high by carbonate level? And what does it mean if there's an anion gap? What about the BUN? What happens if it's low? What happens if it's high? How does the liver affect that? What about creatinine? Are there medications that can increase the creatinine without actually changing the renal function? And then what do you do about glucose? What happens if it's low? How do you keep it from being too high? All of these things are important and get mixed in to the survival benefit in these patients with COVID-19 because we've just discussed a lot of these patients hang around in the intensive care unit for days and even weeks. Moving on really quickly, we've talked about plasma. We do have data on plasma, but it's not placebo control. It's not a controlled trial. And so more work still needs to be done on that. But there was also another emergency use authorization by the FDA to allow us to use plasma in COVID-19 patients. And so that has continued and we are continuing to use plasma. And of course, testing. Now we've talked about testing before. What about those paper tests? Okay, not for use in the hospital particularly, but especially now that schools are opening in some cases and we want to be able to identify people with the disease specifically who can transmit it, who are infectious, who are contagious. And the sensitivity on those type of tests need not be at the level that we have currently for our diagnostic tests that are in the hospital. And I want to say look out for another interview that we're going to have with Dr. Michael Minna on this topic. Last time we talked to you about three patients that have been reinfected. And in most of these cases, in fact, in all three of these cases, the second infection was deemed to be more mild or even asymptomatic. In fact, in one of the cases, the patient only knew that he had the COVID-19 or coronavirus the second time because of a screening evaluation that he did when he flew back from Europe to Hong Kong. We now report a 25 year old from Nevada. So this is the first American case that we have of this, where in mid-April, the patient came down with symptoms of headache, cough, sore throat, nausea, and diarrhea. But after about 10 days, his symptoms completely went away. At the end of May, after testing negative times two to the virus, the patient developed these symptoms. Headache, fever, and again, nausea, and diarrhea. The patient tested positive. So he tested positive here, at the first case, then tested negative times two before testing positive again. And when they compared the genomes of these two positives, they found that they were different. There was a number of differences in the RNA or the genomic material of these viruses. Both of them, however, worked SARS-CoV-2. The difference, though, in this case, was that the patient actually had to be hospitalized the second time and required oxygen, but not a ventilator. And here's the actual preprint. It has not been peer-reviewed as yet, but we will put the link in the description below and here they have the abstract. And the full paper you may have to sign up to the site to be able to read. Of course, it's unclear how generalizable these findings are, or whether this will affect the efficacy of vaccines, which we'll talk about later in this update. One of the things that we mentioned earlier in this update was the use of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Now until August 28, 2020, remdesivir was indicated for the use of COVID-19 in patients who required supplemental oxygen. And they discouraged the use of remdesivir in patients with low renal function and also with patients with high liver function tests or elevated liver enzymes. On August 28, however, they broadened that indication in an emergency use authorization for all hospitalized patients who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 and have COVID-19. So in other words, you don't have to be on supplemental oxygen. And this is the press release and we'll put a link in the description below. Remember that remdesivir is an intravenous medication. And so it would be difficult to give this to patients in the outpatient setting unless something is done to change the vehicle in which it is administered. I also wanted to report that while Moderna and Pfizer have already initiated phase three trials of their vaccine, Tuesday will mark the third company, AstraZeneca, in combination with Oxford University in the UK to start their phase three trials. And all three of those companies are looking for about 30,000 subjects to populate their phase three trials. And they're hoping to get some data out, at least from this Oxford COVID-19 vaccine by Thanksgiving. For those of you who don't know Thanksgiving in the United States is around the end of November. And also to remind you about the Oxford study, what they're doing is they're taking an adenovirus vehicle and they are changing the genetics of that adenovirus so that it presents to the host, to the person getting the vaccine, the protein for the spike protein on the coronavirus itself so that antibodies are made against that spike protein. And just to remind you about this particular Oxford coronavirus vaccine, there was a story that was published in the Oxford vaccine group that showed on July 20, 2020 that there was a strong response to this vaccine. And I'll quote here, the results of a phase one, two trial published today in the scientific journal, The Lancet, indicate no early safety concerns and it induces a strong immune response in both parts of the immune system. The vaccine provoked a T cell response within 14 days of vaccination and also an antibody response within 28 days. And the chief investigator, Professor Andrew Polard at the Oxford vaccine trial at Oxford University says, we saw the strongest immune response in the 10 participants who received two doses of the vaccine, indicating that this might be a good strategy for vaccination. And a little bit more about that phase three trial, they said here that Oxford and AstraZeneca are collaborating with clinical partners around the world as part of a global clinical program to trial the Oxford vaccine. The global program is made up of a phase three trial in the US, enrolling 30,000 patients, a pediatric study as well as a phase three trial to low to middle income countries, including Brazil and South Africa, which are already underway. So this does look promising and we'll have to see what those results will be later this year and hopefully we'll have something to be thankful for at Thanksgiving. And I just wanted to add that neither I nor anybody else here at MedCram have any financial ties to Oxford or to AstraZeneca or for any other vaccine producer for that matter. What we do have an interest in is seeing this COVID-19 disease licked. And for that we will keep working toward an ends.

"COVID 19 Vaccine Update with Professor Michael Mina, MD: Safety, Efficacy, Distribution, Trials",MedCram - Medical Lectures Explained CLEARLY,2020-09-05,OaM04bgFBzw,"There's a lot of questions surrounding how well these vaccines will work. We have to be looking at the safety first and foremost. We've done phase one and two trials. They seem to do pretty well, but these are small trials by design because they're safety trials. But what we did see with many of them is that there were a lot of mild adverse effects, things like fevers, but nothing severe for say, but when you start introducing the vaccine, that's hundreds of people, but hundreds of thousands or millions. They do have to be really aware and concerned about fringe effects. What happens on the edges of the distribution? Do you end up seeing that certain individuals with certain pre-existing conditions, for example, maybe have a severe side effect? That's number one. We have to ensure that we have the right surveillance system set up to make sure that when they do get our reliant phase three, and that's going to be a very good surveillance during phase three, and that's the purpose. But then post-market, once they come to the market, we have to ensure that we are continuing to monitor the situation. If we get vaccinated, if any severe adverse effects are occurring, we need to know about them and quickly dig into them to understand, was it a result of the vaccine or coincidence? And many times, actually, it is coincidence if you're giving a vaccine to millions of people on any given day. Many people, for example, have heart attacks, and so sometimes you can get confounding. So that's number one. And then we need to ensure that the vaccines work. This is a very, these are still essentially in some ways experimental vaccines, whether not in some ways they are experimental vaccines. We've never created a vaccine that was used widely for a coronavirus. And really, we don't have any good vaccines for viruses that don't create what we call sterilizing immunity. There are some. Neumococcus is a good, Neumococcus is actually a bacteria that leads to very good immune responses in people. We know that coronavirus aren't the best viruses to lead to really robust immune responses, and that's why sometimes people get them multiple times. Ideally, the second and third or fourth time that somebody might get them to be infection severity goes down and down and down. But the point is, this is kind of new territory for us. We know how to vaccinate for polio and measles and regal end mumps. These are all infections that lead to very strong immune signals and immunity. And so they were kind of a low hanging fruit in the vaccine world. And so we are, I would say we are keeping our eyes open and trying to understand just how all these vaccines will work. But then we have to add even another layer to it. Most of the technology that the leading vaccine candidates are using is not incorporated into most of the vaccines that are in common use today. So not only are we trying to sort of push a new vaccine into the market against a new bug, but even the technology we're using to do that is fairly new. It has huge promise though. And in terms of scalability, things like the Moderna vaccine, RNA and DNA vaccines can be produced in a whole different way than traditional vaccines and so they could scale a lot better. So there's a lot of good reasons why these experimental approaches to vaccination are being, these are more modern day vaccines I would say, but the question there are many, many questions about just how effective they will be, how long will the immunity last from them. And so I'm very optimistic that they will work okay. I think they will probably work well enough to keep you out of the hospital for example and to keep people from dying. But we don't know how well they will work to stop transmission for example. And if they don't stop transmission, then they may not help a tremendous amount with herd immunity. So we have to, there's a lot of pieces here to consider. As these vaccines progress through the phases of trials and actually get approval from the FDA or authorization from the FDA, there's not like we're going to have all the vaccines we need and be able to distribute them right away. So how is this process going to work where there's a limited number of vaccines, how will they be distributed and how long do you think it will take to really scale these up to where the average person is able to get the vaccine if they want to. Yeah, it's one of the pretty vaccine questions of the day. Who is going to get the vaccine first and not just who, but what countries are going to get the vaccine first? How will we make this equitable? There's billions of people on earth and we can't immediately just start making billions of vaccines. So the federal government, at least in the United States, the federal government really needs to and is setting up task forces essentially to evaluate these questions. How can we fairly distribute vaccines in an equitable way? In general, what's going to happen is that the first people to get them are going to be the people who are placing themselves at risk in order to, in order to help people who are infected. And so these will be the first responders, people like emergency medical individuals, physicians, nurses, people who are dealing with coronavirus-infected individuals and putting themselves in harm's way, but who also could themselves, they got infected, put their patients in harm's way. So it goes in both directions. Vaccinating these individuals first is generally, I think, considered pretty obvious first step in terms of the first people with vaccinate. It gets kind of murky from there. And some of it has to do, for example, with whether or not these vaccines prove to block transmission. If they don't block transmission, for example, then you don't want to bother giving them to really little kids who don't get sick anyway, because you wouldn't really gain much from it. And you would want to give them to vulnerable people if the vaccines work really well to prevent people from getting sick, but don't necessarily prevent people from spreading the virus. You want to give them to older individuals who are hit most, who have been hit hardest with this virus, people with comorbid conditions. The big question that exists is, how well will these vaccines work in the most vulnerable populations, the individuals in nursing homes, the individuals in very elderly categories. These age categories are famous for not having good immune responses. It's why people get sick. As we get old, they get pneumonia. You know, all these infections tend to be the reason that we die. We get infected. And that's because our immune systems generally don't work as well. So if the vaccine, if giving the vaccine to certain age categories is essentially a waste because they're body can't make an immune response. But it becomes very ethical. Do we try to prioritize to the people who have the most to gain, like 60 and 70 year olds over 90 year olds? I don't have the answers for that. But I think these are the kinds of questions that need to be informed by science. We need to make sure that we're making the optimal decisions for society. And it's going to be a very difficult task. There's a question of distribution too. In terms of how quickly can these tests get scaled up. I think that we should anticipate seeing some vaccines come to market. This fall, potentially October and November December, they will be in limited supply. I don't think that the average person can go into their Walgreens and get a vaccine any time this year, probably not even in the first quarter of next year. I think it's going to be spring of 2021 at the earliest before the average individual can actually gain access to a vaccine. And so we still have quite a few months to go before these become really readily available to everyone."
What happened with the AstraZeneca vaccine? - BBC News,BBC News,2021-03-20,Snpclpo7Ono,"This week, we're going to look at a puzzle of how a vaccine that was hailed as a vital achievement finds itself in a scientific and political storm. I think it's sort of some kind of social or fear-based contagion. I mean, there's no rational basis to this. This is a perfectly safe vaccine. And this is what Natasha Loda is talking about. France, Germany and Italy are among several countries to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine over safety fears. In the last 10 days, these European countries have all restricted the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine. Many have completely suspended it, and all have acted on concerns about blood clotting, despite there being no evidence to link this vaccine and blood clotting. And this is the latest message from the EU's medicines regulator. This vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19, and its benefits continue to be far greater than its risks. But these are the first issues that AstraZeneca has faced far from it. First of all, there was the initial information that the company released. One headline read, why Oxford's positive COVID vaccine results are puzzling scientists. Here's another. After admitting mistake, AstraZeneca faces difficult questions about its vaccine. The article goes on to say, experts said the company's spotty disclosures have eroded confidence. In other words, it wasn't clear enough about its data. Also back in January, Emmanuel Macron said, the real problem on AstraZeneca is that it doesn't work the way we were expecting it to. Today, everything points to thinking its cause I am effective on people older than 65. Mr. Macron was wrong, though. There was a shortage of data for the over 65s, but everything suggested the vaccine would be effective. But by this point, a perception was developing. Here's the BBC's Europe correspondent, Jean McKenzie reporting, that Belgium's medical adviser has told me that people here have nicknamed it the Aldi vaccine, after the supermarket, because they see it as the budget option. And this evidence isn't just anecdotal. This recent poll found 20 percent of people in France have confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine for Pfizer. It's 52 percent. And while confidence in AstraZeneca falls in Europe, infections of COVID rise. This is my colleague, Nick Beak. In Prague, in Paris, and once again in Bergamo, in Northern Italy, COVID patients gasped for air. The nightmare prospect of a third wave in Europe is now real. There's also the speed of Europe's vaccine rollout. It's far slower than the UK and the US, as you can see. So, infection rates, hospitalisations, vaccination speed, the AstraZeneca job could help address all of these. But there are at least four reasons why things have become complicated. PR, process, politics, and first, patience, Norwegian patients. The clusters of patients that we are talking about are not the more common plots, like the Eplan from Bosis. These are very rare and severe cases with critical outcome in a very young population, where this is not common at least seen. A Norway's decision has influenced other countries, as this expert explains. Once one of them starts doing it, then they get a collective anxiety. They don't want to be standing out. They don't want to be the only ones going on delivering it. And if Norway's decision is the first factor, the second is politics. AstraZeneca finds itself in the middle of broader political tensions between the UK and the EU. This was the EU's warning this week. We want to see reciprocity and proportionality in exports. And we are ready to use whatever tool we need to deliver on that. And this is all about AstraZeneca. And whether doses produced in the UK are being fairly distributed to the EU, and the threat to restrict vaccine exports was greeted this way by one UK cabinet minister who told Politico, it's got to the stage where this has become naked jingoism from the EU against Britain. They hate Brexit. They hate that our vaccine rollout has gone so well. Now the EU would dismiss that. But the performance of every vaccine rollout is political. And because AstraZeneca is one of the main vaccines in Europe and the UK, it's become politicized. There is, though, another explanation for this vaccine situation. It's a third factor. Process. Tom Nuttle is the economist Berlin correspondent. He tweets, you don't need to conjure Baroque theories to explain why European regulators steeped in precautionary principles. Il suited to a pandemic are following their usual bureaucratic logic. Keep Tom's comments in mind as we listen to Emmanuel Macron. We are led here by a simple guide, informed by science and the relevant authorities, also doing so within the framework of a European strategy. That word framework is crucial. The issue with AstraZeneca is whether those frameworks have led to a decision out of step with the urgency of the moment. And if those frameworks have stopped countries addressing a fourth factor, PR, because once questions exist about a vaccine, they can spread rapidly. This is a senior US epidemiologist. This is part of the challenge we have of vaccine confidence. If I tell you that vaccine A or drug A is involved with something and it gets, for example, on the internet, suddenly you'll have a number of people saying, look at I took that same drug, right, took that same vaccine and now look what happened to me. Because regulators, politicians and AstraZeneca aren't just taking decisions about science, they're taking decisions about information. And as AstraZeneca acknowledges, the pressure that brings is enormous. This has been for me probably the toughest thing I've ever worked on in terms of the goldfish bowl environment that you're in, where every single thing is scrutinized, politicized, turned around, misrepresented. That was probably inevitable. Faced with a vast global problem, AstraZeneca was built as a key part of the solution. It still is. Now though, this vaccine is becoming a real-time lesson in how our systems and our politics are struggling to cope with this pandemic and with how doubt and suspicion are easily created and very hard to erase. It's a lesson being learned the hard way."
Vaccine injuries reported,Dr. John Campbell,2024-05-05,boqKzpftNSI,"Welcome to this talk, it's Sunday the 5th of May. Now I believe that the truth about COVID vaccines is starting to come out. I wasn't sure whether it would or not for quite a long time whether this would be suppressed or whether it would come out into the public domain as it were or the widespread public domain. And what I want to look at today is a very encouraging article from the New York Times. This was published two days ago. This is the article here. Thousands believe COVID vaccines harm them is anyone listening. Now this article is not sort of an interrogative analytical article that you and I might like, but what it does do is it admits overtly that there are serious side effects in some people with these vaccines. But it still just take the overall tenor that the vaccines were beneficial altogether, which we could discuss and we have discussed. But it's a move in the right direction. Now why I think this is so important is this. Now if we look at this here, this is called the Overton window. Now what was unthinkable, completely unthinkable becomes a radical idea. Then it can become acceptable, then it can be sensible, then it can be popular, then it can be policy and of course that can come from either direction. So the window has changed, the window slides up and down on this thing here as I understand it. So I think we're moved now too. I would say when probably at the acceptable level now because it's in the some aspects of the mainstream media or some aspects of thinking are in the mainstream media. Now I don't think I've gone intellectual. I only got that from Claire Craig's Twitter account. So that's how I knew about that. But I think it's a very good model. It shows that things are starting to come out now much more into the public domain. Now let's look at some of the detail here. This is more or less straight from the article published on the third of May 2024 case study it starts off with. I'm not going to I've decided not to use names on this. The names are in the article. The article you can get it. I think you might have to register, but you don't have to pay for it. You can actually get the article, which is also good because New York Times articles are often paywalled. So that's another very encouraging sign. This is coming into the more public specter of consideration. So I'm not going to use the names, but 37 year old woman fitting well within minutes of getting the Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine felt pain racing from a left arm up to a rear and down to a finger tips. So pain straight away within minutes. And that's got implications as well. Was there an inadvertent in transula administration or a greater level of in transula administration you might think, but we don't know that felt pain racing down from a left arm to a rear and down to a finger tips horrible within days. She was a unbearably sensitive to light and struggled to remember simple facts. And it's interesting that it actually starts off with this. So this is this is the New York Times. So it's quite a powerful starting paragraph really, I thought. Now three years later, diagnosed with brain damage cannot work drive or stand for long periods of time. She says devastation of what has this is done to my life and how much I've lost. And one of many accounts, of course, and we have interviewed so many people Kyle Kyle Warner that we interviewed just a couple of days ago on this channel. I'll put his link to the video. Who's now campaigning for vaccine damage awareness. As of April 2024, there was over 13,000 vaccine injury compensation claims filed with the federal government. Now, what I've done here is I've actually taken the data that is published, government data here from the United States. And they are saying that there's 13,116 claims, but what is telling on this is compensated claims 12. So in the United States, 12 people have been compensated for vaccine damage 12 out of the entire country. Quite incredible. Of the cases that have been forward 19 percent have been reviewed, 47 percent deemed ineligible for compensation so far. 12 claims paid out an average of $3,600. This has to change because firstly, these people deserve recognition. And secondly, we have to restore trust in our medical systems. Now, those medical systems have now got to prove themselves, you know, the journal system, the pharmaceutical system, they've got to prove themselves worthy of trust. And that's quite a big ask some might think. But we have to have this transparency because at the moment we have this lack of trust and it's doing no one any good whatsoever. And to hide these things is not fostering trust and understanding and the reality of the situation. This has to be remedied. Inologist, vaccine expert university of Yale University, people who say they are post vaccine injuries just completely ignored, dismissed and gaslighted, which has been happened so often, very often, especially in the early stages, people simply told this was an anxiety related problem. Janet Woodcock recently retired director of the FDA. Some of this is quite interesting actually. The people that are free to talk are often retired and we could give a few examples on nearing retirement or feel free to talk, which again is a tragic situation. We have to have freedom of medical scientific expression. Otherwise, we're going to return to the dark ages. So many implications to this, they just go on and on. Anyway, Janet Woodcock, some recipients got uncommon but serious life changing reactions beyond those described by federal agencies. So okay. Now, interesting Janet Woodcock's not saying rare here. She's gone down to, it's uncommon a weaker word than rare I would have thought so. Then she says, I feel bad for these people, for those people. I believe their suffering should be acknowledged. This is key. The suffering needs to be acknowledged and they have real problems and they should be taken seriously. And to her credit, she's saying I'm disappointed in myself. Many of us of course are disappointed in ourselves but it's good for people to admit that. I'm disappointed in myself. I'm sure many of you are. But for someone who's been a senior position to acknowledge that is, I would say it's encouraging. It's a step towards freedom of speech and expression and the reality of the situation. Again, Janet Woodcock again. I did a lot of things I feel very good about, fair enough. This is one of the few things I just feel I didn't bring it home. The article then comments on disparaging US health care systems. So what it does, the article does say that US health care systems, you might go to a pharmacy for a vaccine and then your doctor might not know about it if you've got a doctor and it's all compartmentalized. So collecting data in the United States is a problem. In the United Kingdom it's not. The problem here is my government has released data on vaccine adverse reactions and people that are no longer with us to the pharmaceutical industry but has not released it to the public domain for interrogation by our scientists, epidemiologists and statisticians. So it's a different situation in America. The data is difficult to collect in the UK. We are being secretive about it. Two different situations I think. Well then, yeah, disparities, the disparate nature, sort of all divided. No central responsibility of vaccine recipients in the States. Government compensation from the Fudge officially recognized a few side effects for COVID vaccines. And vaccine supporters, including federal officials, worry that even a whisper of possible side effects leads to misinformation, spread of a vitriolic anti-vaccine, spread via vitriolic anti-vaccine movement. Okay, there is an anti-vaccine movement. There's also a movement that I would like to think I represent, but a very small part of people that are simply looking for the truth. We want to follow the evidence. That's what we want to do. So there's been this idea that government officials haven't dared whisper anything about any vaccine adverse reaction because this group of ogres, these hideous people would you weaponize this against this also good vaccination programme. I'll let you decide where you lie on that continuum. I'm not so sure the vaccine programme is that good, but you'll have your own opinions on that. Now patients who believe the experience has a serious side effects. Say they have received little support or acknowledgement, which is true that has to change. Now New York time then gives some examples and again it gives the names. I'm just deciding not to use the names. SB 54-year-old male, man, nurse practitioner, New York City. Ever since his first Covid shot, merely standing up sent his heart racing post-relathe static Tachycardic syndrome. This is this POTS syndrome that has been a common presentation around the world. When people stand up or exert themselves the heart rate goes very, very, very high. It's Tachycardic syndrome. When the heart's beating very quickly it's often beating inefficiently as well unless it's a physiological situation. This is a pathological situation and of course that may make people go dizzy faint fall over. Apart from the horrible feeling, very disconcerting to feel things going wrong with your heart. I mean it's a horrible thing to happen. Stinging pain in the eyes, mouth, genitals which has abated and tinnitus which has not. It's a vitro-fibulation I guessed from the picture that was in the newspaper. Also I can't get the government to help me. I'm told I'm not real, I'm told I'm rare, I'm told I'm coincidence. And this is why the media is so important because people can realise that they are not alone. And that's one of the reasons we've been interviewing people with vaccine injury of nobody come forward. And we've realised that there are many people with very similar symptoms all around the world. People are not alone and should not be made to think there's some sort of freak. R.F. 49-year-old physical therapist, woman, Seattle Bells, paulzy, the facial paralysis, dramatic facial rash, shingles reported to the federal database twice, expected someone to come. Someone for sure would reach out but no one ever did. So no interest at all from the authorities. New York Times then talks about interviews with 30 people and we can divide these symptoms and this is consistent with what we're seeing around the world. Some are neurological, primarily. Some autoimmune primarily and some cardiovascular primarily. Some people have pictures of those unfortunately. All these people of the 30 said that been turned away by physicians, told their symptoms were psychosomatic. It's a pauling. Psycho, of course, means mind, mind affecting the body or labelled as anti-vaxed by family and friends. We must stop stereotyping people and listen to people as individuals. We've said this a million times on this channel. Healthcare has to be individualised. We assess, plan, implement and evaluate on the individual, not on a population. BC, Doctor, Man, Tinnitus, Racing Heart lasted about a week after each shot. This guy's a, this is another one GP, also a doctor, also a man. Loud-wushing sounds in his ears accompany every moment since his first shot. How appalling must that be? This constant noise in the ears. Must drive you completely crazy. The first thing you're aware of when you wake up in the morning is his whooshing sound in your ears. A pauling situation. How can you work or function and not go completely mad with something like that? We have to listen to these people and treat us to colleagues at centres for disease control and prevention to explore this phenomenon at Tinnitus. We've read, led, nowhere. If they've done studies, GP says that the done studies these should be published. Of course, everything should be published. Put into the public domain for scientific peer review. This is how science progresses, thesis is presented, anti-thesis can be argued, synthesis emerges. That becomes the next thesis. This is how we develop. We have a bit of a ding dong down the pub over a few ideas. We discuss it in academic papers. This is how science develops, but it's not being allowed. It's being emasculated. That's the change. CDC recognizes agency documents only four serious, incredible. I didn't know this. Only four serious adverse events from the vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson Geong-Barry, the progressive paralysis of the feet works up. Can affect the risk of biogeomusles caused by an inflammatory pollen neuritis, is recognized in the blood clotting that we've talked about many times. Also recognized. MRNA vaccine, high inflammation or myocarditis. The high inflammation and anaphylaxis. According to the CDC, there's only two adverse reactions from Johnson & Johnson or two serious ones, Geong-Barry and blood clotting. From the MRNA vaccine, there's the only thing you've got to worry about that's serious is the cyclimation of anaphylaxis. I mean, dear me, this is the Centers for Disease Control in the United States of America. It really is quite incredible. Anyway, nearly finished. Director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, this doctor. Agents' systems are monitoring vaccine safety are pretty close to ideal. Do you think they're pretty close to ideal? Let's just check that's what he actually said. Yep, that's what it said. Pretty close to ideal. Cah, dear me. I thought there might be an issue there for a minute. What a relief. The systems are pretty close to ideal. This is someone who's a director. I mean... Okay. CD said there were no confirmed related to myocarditis, but in fact there have been several accounts of reported post-of-vaccination of left-the-hyperlinks in. An epitiate we're not even completely free to discuss it now that we have to use... ...loadalities of communication to communicate deeper truths. It's unfortunate, inconvenient. Anyway, there we are. Are we moving? Looks like we probably are. And as it was said, I think we're at the acceptable level. Next it will become sensible and popular and hopefully become policy. Interesting. I did think that this could go either way because there are certain things, even now I'm not sure I'm allowed to mention, that have been suppressed during the last few years. I wasn't sure if this would be won or not, but I think the problem is so ubiquitous, so obvious around the world. This one's probably going to come out as a massive, massive, massive issue. Things are moving. If we move towards greater truth and transparency and openness, I think that's a good thing. Let me know what you think, and thank you for watching."
AstraZeneca admits its Covid vaccine can cause rare side effect in court documents for first time,The Telegraph,2024-05-02,42hZB-A0K10,"The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine has been rightly held as a miracle and for many millions it worked just as intended. But for a rare few the vaccine has proved to be a killer. The government medicine regulator has linked 81 deaths in the UK to thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, TTS for short. It basically causes both clots and bleeding. This week the telegraph obtained documents which revealed AstraZeneca had admitted for the first time in legal proceedings that its jab can in very rare cases trigger TTS. Its admission of the side effect in court documents could yet lead to payouts for those affected and the government has pledged to underwrite the bills. Among those fighting for fair compensation is 47 year old Jamie Scott. A father of two Jamie suffered a permanent brain injury 10 days after having the jab in April 2021. We should point out AstraZeneca has denied the legal claim being brought under the Consumer Protection Act. Add to the telegraph to read the full investigation."
Fauci discusses concerns about Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine data l GMA,Good Morning America,2021-03-23,Ti9ikMU32BY,"Joining us now is Dr. Anthony Fauci. He is the Chief Medical Advisor to President Biden. And as always, Dr. Fauci, we appreciate you taking time to speak with us. And we want to start with that new report. We just heard this morning that major concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information in its trial results. How did that happen? And what could this mean about its possible effectiveness? Well, what happened, Robin, is that the data that are analyzed from any given trial go through what's called a data and safety monitoring board, which is an independent group of people who are experienced and who look at the data. When the data from the AZ trial that was conducted predominantly in the United States was analyzed by the DSMB together with the company, what happened is that the company put out a press release giving a data and making some conclusions about the efficacy. And the data and safety monitoring board, when they saw that press release, they got concerned and wrote a rather harsh note to them and with a copy to me saying that in fact they felt that the data that was in the press release were somewhat outdated and might in fact be misleading a bit and wanted them to straighten it out. On the basis of that, we put out the release that you just showed that essentially told the company they better get back with the DSMB and make sure the correct data get put into a press release. I don't have to tell you it doesn't help people are already hesitant when it comes to vaccination. And in this one in particular given what we've seen in Europe with AstraZeneca, that vaccine being suspended for a time. So how do you address those concerns, especially if this becomes of use here in the US? You know, Robert, it really is unfortunate that this happened. You know, this is really what you call an unforced error because the fact is this is very likely a very good vaccine. And this kind of thing does as you say do nothing but really cast some doubt about the vaccines and maybe contribute to the hesitancy. It was not necessary. If you look at it, the data really are quite good. But when they put it into the press release, it wasn't completely accurate. So we have to keep essentially trying as hard as we can to get people to understand that there are safeguards in place. And I think the data and safety monitoring board picking up this discrepancy was an example of a safeguard. And at the end of the day, Robin, all of this is going to be decided by the FDA. They will independently go over every bit of data themselves and not rely on any interpretation from anyone including the company. So that's one thing that the American public should realize and probably the global public also that our FDA independently goes over that data. So that's something you don't need to be worried about. What is a number one concern that you're hearing from folks when it comes to vaccinations overall? And how do you address those concerns? Well, you know, Robin, one of the things that people are concerned about that I think we can get around by essentially taking the time to explain to them that the vaccine was developed in really record time, who was really quite quick. The fastest we've ever had a vaccine go from a discovery of a pathogen. In this case, the coronavirus and the time it went into people's arms. That speed was not reckless speed. It really was a reflection of decades of extraordinarily exquisite science, which went into things like the development of new vaccine platforms and immunogens. So I think when people understand that, that this is the result of a lot of science over many, many years and a very, very extensive clinical trial process. So this has really been done really quite well. We just got to make sure that people understand that and the medical technology that we've seen in recent years. I also want to ask you about this. We have seen a slight uptick uptick in some states when it comes to COVID, but we've also seen a plateau, thankfully in hospitalizations and in deaths. So are you more concerned and more hopeful with the vaccine rollout as it is? Are you more concerned or hopeful in the months ahead, Dr. Fauci? Well, I'm quite optimistic about what the impact of the vaccines are going to be because every day we give up to three million doses of vaccine in people's arms. I believe that's going to ultimately have a very positive impact. But in the meanwhile, as you showed on your piece just a moment ago, the number of cases in the country have plateaued. That's not good. They should keep going down and down and they've plateaued at a level of about 53,000 cases a day, which is not good because we've seen this before. When you plateau like that, there really is a danger of a resurgence. We're actually seeing that in Europe. And quite frankly, we generally are about three to four weeks behind the dynamics of the outbreak that we see in Europe. So given that the Europeans are surging back up, that that is very clear that this is a risk that we will be doing the same thing. We don't pull back. And when I was we need to keep doing the public health measures that we talk about all the time. We need to keep all of that in mind. Dr. Fauci, as I said, thank you. Thank you for always being willing to come to speak with us. We really do appreciate it. You take care. Thank you. Thank you, Vanny. Well, hey there, GMA fans, Robin Roberts here.

AstraZeneca withdraws its COVID-19 vaccine,CBC News,2024-05-08,84FQVzWhFsY,"The drug maker AstraZeneca is withdrawing its COVID-19 vaccine worldwide because it says of a surplus of other newer, more effective vaccines. Demand for the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is declined because other shots that target the variance have been developed. AstraZeneca, in fact, no longer manufactures or supplies the vaccine. And it hasn't been available in Canada since December of last year, but it was an early vaccine in this country. The third vaccine approved by health Canada at the time of the pandemic. And it started rolling out here in March of 2021. The company making the move, it says because of business issues, consumer issues, but there's another part to the story, which we're going to talk about with Dr. Samir Gupta, who's here in studio as he is on Wednesdays, respirologists and an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto. Welcome back. How many times do we talk about AstraZeneca in the early days? And we're throwing back to that. The other part of the story, so it's pulling it from the vaccine. 150 countries use the AstraZeneca vaccine. Canada was one of them. And it's pulling it off the market worldwide. For consumer reasons, there are other better vaccines, but also in court documents, which the company filed. It was revealed for the first time that the company admitted to some serious side effects with its vaccine. What was the new information? I mean, it's not new to the scientific community, but it's new that the company's acknowledged it because they are facing lawsuits around this complication. And so this is what we call VIT or VITT vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia. So the thrombotic part refers to clotting, thrombosis is clot. Thrombocytopenia refers to low platelets. So this is a syndrome where people form clots in their body and their platelet levels are low. Those are sort of the hallmarks. That's how we identify this. And it was identified that ultimately we figured out scientifically how this happens and why this happens, but it was identified that these are what we call viral vector vaccines. This vaccine and the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, they use a virus to get the genetic material of the spike protein into our bodies so that our cells then make the spike protein we form antibodies were protected. In about one in 50,000 people, rarely, this happens. Where what will happen is the the adenovirus that viral vector will bind to an element in our blood called pf4, platelet factor 4. So this is a naturally occurring part of our clotting cascade, which actually activates our platelets. Platelets are those little cells that form clots. So you get a cut, your platelet factor 4 levels go up locally, tells the platelets to form a clot, it blocks the bleeding and you're protected. What happens is when the virus binds to the platelet factor 4, the body forms antibodies against that complex and that activates the platelet factor 4. And so then you have this indiscriminate clotting because the platelet factor 4 is activated when it shouldn't be really. And you have clots that can form anywhere in the body and that can be dangerous and that's what this complication is. And not new to the scientific community, not new to our conversations because we were getting reports of this in the early days of its use. But in the court documents, it reveals just in the UK that we're 80 deaths associated with that. Is it more widespread? Is it more serious than perhaps we understood at the time? So early on, so it wasn't seen in the trials because something that happens in about one in 50,000 people is not usually going to be detected. There won't be enough of a signal in a trial, even a large trial as these trials were. This is something you pick up in post-marketing when you have millions of doses going out and you start seeing maybe 20 people in a million get this kind of a complication. Death from this is in that 10 to 20 percent range. So still high, but again, you're talking about one in 50,000 get it and then a small percentage. But yes, some people died of this complication. Early on, there was a signal around, hey, maybe this is happening. And then later, we got some numbers around it by around mid-2021. So, but as you said, if you go back, you know, we're sort of the retrospectoscope can be dangerous sometimes. You go back, we had where you're into the pandemic, December of 2020, you get the first MRNA vaccines approved and then I think by February, this vaccine was approved. And you know, this was in the UK, the first vaccine administered, big fanfare. We talked about it. British science, Boris Johnson was going wild. Exactly. And so it was, this was a time when we approved all three, but the world was clamoring for vaccines. We did not Pfizer and Moderna did not deliver MRNA to Canada. That was a big point of contention. It went to the US and it stayed in Europe. Right. And so this was a time where we, I was saying scientific consensus was get the first vaccine you've had. Get this one available. And I did. I was 2.3 million Canadians, got the AstraZeneca shot. I was one of them. And we think back to that time, I'm wondering if those who also did, I mean, is there any point about being concerned about it now? Any reason to have concerned if you had it way back then? No, this is in the first six weeks after you get the vaccine. If you had it, you had it and you're fine. Even if you had the first dose very unlikely, on the second dose, you know, maybe 2 and a million on the second dose, it was still the right thing to do because that people forget. Now we have an immune population from vaccines and from natural infection. That was a time when the virus was much more dangerous. Everything is always about risk benefit ratio. At that time, even with this early signal around this complication, because we didn't have MRNA vaccines and because the virus was rampant and so dangerous at the time to our population, it was still the right thing to do. That risk benefit shifted by mid 2021, as we learn more about this, but also as we then had MRNA vaccines. Other options were better vaccines. It's such an important perspective, how it evolved at that time. Because, you know, you can appreciate, I'm hearing from viewers saying, you know, we've talked about vaccination. Those who are not in favor of vaccination, hey, Heather, did you hear about this? I told you so long. I told you so. Exactly. AstroZeneca was worse than we thought at that time. So what is the, what should, what view should we have? And I'm wondering if there's any concern about how this kind of revelation might play into what is still growing? Vaccine hesitancy, we're talking, we'll get the measles shot right now. We're still talking about get COVID boosters, you know, cases are going up in Alberta. We're talking about this for now. So how do we sort of frame it? Frame this information in the context of we still need to be getting vaccines for other things. Yeah, you know, I think what's important here is this played out how it should play out, how it should have played out. So new virus, you know, that we've never seen before, within a year, amazing scientific achievement that we had vaccines for this virus. Anytime you have a new product, whether it's a drug or a vaccine, you are going to have the potential for complications, a very rare complication was detected properly in post-marketing by monitoring what's happening with the vaccine, very rare. And when we discovered it and identified it and measured it, we stopped distributing the vaccine. That's exactly what should happen. In the time the vaccine was used, it was still the right thing to do. Six and a half million people were saved by this vaccine in the first year after release, over three billion doses. Don't forget how dangerous the virus was. So everything is about risk benefit and that's the message. And so the message is science worked, science developed this vaccine, saved millions of lives. Now there's a better vaccine. And yes, this vaccine had a rare complication that this better vaccine doesn't have. And therefore that better vaccine has taken over. And this is no longer something we use. But that, you know, ultimately we can't forget that the virus is worse than the vaccine even with this complication. And that's why, you know, although there's no treatment that doesn't come with the potential for a side effect, including, you know, rare anaphylaxis, rare allergic reactions people to have even to measles vaccines that have been around for decades. But you can't forget the disease itself being more dangerous than the vaccine. Okay, that's a great point on which to conclude this week. Thank you so much for all of that. See you next Wednesday. See you next Dr. Goop."
White clots common,Dr. John Campbell,2024-02-08,4rAoqhTUU0g,"Well, I hope you found those early pictures interesting. They were supplied by Major Tom Havilland, who I'm going to introduce now. Tom, thank you for very, very much for coming on this video. John, thanks for having me on the show to talk about this very important topic. Now, Tom, as the name would imply, has been a major in the United States Air Force for a career. Also, in engineer, mathematician and data scientist and analyst, so in a good position to do this work. Now, what on Earth? What on Earth are we looking at here, Tom, please? We're looking at a white, fibrous clots that have been supplied by embalmers, and they're seeing these, all around the world, embalmers, or seeing these clots, and they're seeing them actually in a high percentage of their corpses, unfortunately, John. And they've been seeing mostly over the last three years. I actually have a small vial of the clots, like to show the audience live. I'll turn it slowly around so we can see the consistent. Yeah, you can see that really clearly. And what are they? And where did you get them, Tom? Got these from, I'm bomber Richard Hirschman, who is featured in the Died Suddenly movie. Richard's been sending vials of these out to laboratories and scientists all over the world. We're trying to examine the clots and figure out what they're made of. One of the theories is if they're made from amyloid protein, amyloid is AMY, L-O-I-D, it's just a fancy term for a mischaper, misfolded protein that builds up in our bodies. And there's some thibrin from blood clotting processes in them as well as them. Correct. Dr. Ryan Cole has looked at them, the famous pathologist from Idaho, and he says it's combination of the amyloid protein, fibrin, our blood has fibrinogen in it that is in liquid form that then converts into fibrin when there's damage done to the lining of the veins or arteries. And that fibrin is white. And then there's also, he's found platelets in there too, and they're colorless. So that combination of fibrin platelets in this amyloid or amyloid-like material. And what's the consistency like? Is it, can you pull it apart? It stretches, it can break if you put enough force on it, but it's almost like a rubber band. It looks like a calamari and kind of feels like a rubber band to the, to the embalmers. Very unusual. Now these have been, in the embalming process, these are flushed out of the circulatory system. And they're collected by embalmers. So these have been taken directly from the circulatory system of the recently deceased. This is where these come from. Correct. And embalmers have two favorite injection site points when they do embalming. Their favorite is the carotid artery in the neck. So that's the main spot they've been finding these clots. They also will do an injection site point sometimes in the iliac artery down in the pelvis region that then runs down your femoral arteries in the legs. So that doesn't necessarily mean where the clots are being formed job, but that's where the embalmers seem to be finding the clots. Obviously, as they're flushing out at these injection site points. However, some of the embalmers have told me recently they've had to actually create more injection site points because when they run into a body that has a lot of these clots, then they have to use alternate points in order to get them all out. And it's actually, it's actually a length in the process of embalming. Embalming used to take about an hour to an hour and a half for an embalmer, and now it's taking about two to two and a half hours for an embalming. So in some of the recently deceased, this is actually clogging up the acycidatri system such as the embama conflicts the blood out. Yeah, and the embalmers that I've talked to are pretty insistent that they believe the clots are forming before death. They think that they may be forming after death as well, but they're insistent that they're performing before death because they're seeing them in bodies. They're only an hour too old and still warm. They've not been refrigerated. And they just there's no way they said these clots could have formed in the hour or two since the person was deceased. That means, Tom, that these clots are almost certainly the cause of death. Yes, I think it's, you get this in your system. It's quite obvious it can cause strokes or heart attacks, right? A piece of, you know, breaks off and forms an embolism, for example, you can get a stroke. And one of the interesting things, John, is the traditional clots, like the grave jelly clots and the chicken fat clots and embolmers have been seen forever. Yeah, we almost exclusively appear on the, on the venous side of the body, but these white fibers clots are appearing as well on the arterial side on both the venous and the arterial side, which it's very uncommon from bombers to see clots on the arterial side. I mean, there's no question that these were occlude these things in arteries were just to include the arteries and of course you'd have a heart attack. Of course you'd have a stroke. And the other thing I'm noticing, Tom, is if we look here, this has kind of got a branching structure. I think this is what you call a cast. Yes. It is essentially a mold from the inside of a piece of the vascular system. That's what the embolmers believe as well, John. Then it's actually taking you on, like you say, the shape of the main canal and then all the tributaries running off of it. Correct. That's exactly what this is like. I mean, I can't really see anything else. We'll cause that. We've got some more examples to look at, Tom, I think. So here's another example here. Six inches long. Yeah, and that's not uncommon, John. Many of the bombers were finding these clots in the six to ten inch range. And there's actually been some cases where they pulled clots that are two feet long out of people's legs. So this is an amazing, serious thing that's going on. So six inches, 15, 15, 16 centimeters. And again, that one's clearly showing a bifurcation in my mind, isn't it? It's an arterial cast. Correct. And if that was in a vessel, I don't see any blood getting through at all. Quite, quite incredible. Now, let's just point out that these just aren't isolated incidents. These are several. That's some going to jaw similar to yours. Yeah. And I spoke with, uh, and Balmer Richard Hirschman recently, and Richard says that he has over 250 photos on his phone, Dr. Campbell, of clots coming out of over 250 different people. He's got examples of this white fibrous clots as well as another issue we'll talk about called microclotting. Well, so this is he's got photos from lots of people that he's involved. Yeah. So that scalpel there again, it'll be about probably eight inches long altogether, the blade would be a couple inches long. Um, and I think what we're seeing here is we're seeing the look cloth that you would expect. Right. And then these are like things. Yeah. Yeah. And like I said, Balmer's have been seeing those forever. They actually look and feel like Grave Jelly, they dissolve easily in their hands much different than these white fibrous clots. And much different than, than, uh, and Balmer's have been seeing chicken fat clots for years too. They're, they're small yellowish in color and they tear very easily. Very different than these large white fibrous clots that are much tougher and more elastic. Yeah. Yeah. The yellow one medically, I think we call that white thrombus. It's a, well, it's the platelet aggregation. It's a well-recognized pathological process. Just looking a few more to show these aren't just random things that these are more here. Again, very similar. Um, another example there. Um, masses of these things. I mean, I mean, what kind of volume are we getting like a pound of these out of someone? It's, it's sharp. It's grams. It's incredible. Yeah. And there's different doctors and scientists around the world that are looking at the problem and trying to figure out how it's forming. There's a few theories that have come up recently. There was a paper out of Cambridge and right in your neck of the woods, Dr. Campbell, a few months ago, they talked about a process called frame shifting. Where the, um, our ribosomes might be misreading the modified RNA that they're receiving and producing about 10 percent of the time, what's called an aberrant or nonsense protein. 90 percent of the time is, it's producing the correct spike protein that it's supposed to, with about 10 percent of the time it's producing a nonsense protein that then could be the formation of these light-fibers clots. So that's of course, I'm a lawyer. It's a well-known pathological protein. For example, it accumulates in the brain, doesn't it, in, uh, in Alzheimer's disease, for example? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Another theory that's out there is that the, uh, spike protein may be, uh, damaging or irritating the endothelial lining of the inside walls of the blood vessels. And if it actually causes the endothelial lining to rupture, it's a, it's a thin single layer of cells that's issue the, tissue factor from the interior of the walls of the blood vessels could be spilling into the bloodstream and forming these clots as well. So there are scientists around the world that are looking at the problem. What exactly is, you know, forming or how this amyloid material is building up in, in the bloodstream? Mm-hmm. I mean, the idea that it's damaged to the vascular endothelial wall, I don't really see that because these things are solid, aren't they? They're, you know, if, if that's the lumen of the blood vessel, then this white stuff is like filling up the whole gap in the middle, isn't it? Yeah, well, we think it's growing, right? So it's, yeah, some point is smaller, right? And blood still able to flow around, but then at some point, it completely blocks off the vessel or your embolism breaks off and goes to a critical juncture, and that's when you get your stroke or heart attack. So, you know, it may, it may be a process where it tastes maybe six months, maybe 12 or 18 months for these to grow to the size that they become dangerous to a living person. Really? So they could be, they could be growing for some months. Could be. We're not sure, but the data that I've collected seems to indicate that's a possibility. Wow. Because some of the bombers didn't start seeing the white fiber cloths until the middle of 2021, after a certain event happened earlier that year. Let's go back a bit. 2020. Yeah. There was a lot of people getting the Wuhan version of the SARS-CoV-1 virus to and then into the alpha. Were, and that's before the vaccine rolled out, of course, when this disease was presumably rampant, because there was no vaccination, were you getting any reports of these white things, whatever we call them, happening in 2020? I did indeed, John, to a lesser extent. In our first survey, 44 of the embalmers, we got 179 responses from embalmers in our first survey that we did last year, and 44 of those embalmers did see the white fiber's cloths. And that makes sense, because like I said, there's a spike protein on the surface of the virus itself, and we believe that spike protein on the virus itself can lead to the formation of these amyloid proteins. But then the embalmer saw that explode in 2021, when we had the advent of the rollout of the medical intervention. So many more embalmer saw the phenomenon in 2021. And as we know, there's a rationale for that, right? Because the medical intervention was supposed to stay in your deltoid muscle and produce just enough of the spike protein to listen to an immune response, and do that for just a couple of days or a week, and then this job is done, it's got you ready for COVID when it came. But we know now that that's not what happened at all. The medical intervention goes all over your body, turning your whole body into a spike protein factory, and it can do that for months at a time. So the scientists that I've talked to, John, believe that it's exacerbated or supercharged the effect of the formation of these white virus clots. I just have to take a breath on to pause so I don't get cross. You know, we were told exactly what you said. And it was wrong. These lipid nanoparticles are systemically distributed. They go everywhere. And we're just starting to learn some of the consequences of that. Misinformation, lie, whatever top again, whatever you want to call it. But we'll stick with we'll just stick with it. So 2021, 2022, did the amount that we're seeing remain constant 2021, 2022, 2023? No, 2021 and 2022, we did our survey last year. In fact, we can go to the slides if you want to. We actually do. We will in a minute. Yeah. Yeah. But actually in 2023, when we just check this year, the percentage of corpses that contain the white virus clots went down from an average of about 30 percent down to 20 percent. It's in 2023. And yeah, in 2022, it was about 30 percent of corpses contain these white virus clots like I'm showing here. But in 2023, that went down to 20 percent. And that's not necessarily a vindication of the medical intervention. Because if you remember, here in the America, about 80 percent of adults over the age of 18, at least the first two medical interventions way back in 2021. But only about 20 percent of Americans took the VA 4, VA 5, by VA assistance, on booster in the fall of 2022. And even less Americans, about 15 percent John, took the XBV 1.5 booster that came out last fall of 2023. So as you get further and further away from the medical interventions, you might expect to see less of these white virus clots, which is indeed what bombers said in 2023. So basically, I think we've identified a temporal correlation and a quantitative temporal correlation there. Well, you know, we can't necessarily say, correlation's not necessarily causation, John. But you know, I've seen an awful lot of correlation here. So I'll just let you know that. Yeah, we're not sure of correlation at the moment, Tom. That is for sure. Unfortunately, I think the data indicates no John, it is a spike protein problem. Yes. The way the spike protein comes from of that I am completely convinced on, completely. The bombers you've talked to, had they seen anything like this, anything at all, like this before? No, the bombers I've talked to John and you'll see in the survey, these bombers have 20 or 30 years of experience, John. And they've never seen this phenomenon before until the last few years. Like I said, they've only seen great jelly clots and chicken fat clots in the past. Nothing white virus clots. Yeah. And I've got half a dozen big thick books on pathology and they're not in there. This is a new phenomena. It's a new pathology. Should we go and look at some of your data on the slides, Tom? Absolutely. Let's go look at some of the data. And then I have a story for you afterwards. It's a bit of a scandal, I think, but we'll talk about it. Maybe I can just let me give you a story just before that as well. I've just been talking to a senior undertaker in England. And he wasn't aware of this, but he's actually been talking to his embalmer just today. Who in this guy basically embarms all the time, it's what he does. And he says, in the people he is embalming, he's seeing a fifth to a third of people with these clots. That's not surprising to me. That's right in the wheelhouse of the averages you'll see here on the slides coming up. 20 to 30 percent. Now, one thing that surprised me, he says that the amount of embalming prior to cremation and prior to burial is roughly the same. Again, where we live, it's about 30 percent in other parts of the country, it's 50 or 60 percent. So basically, he's saying 20 to 30 percent of people being embalmed to 20 to 30 percent of those having these clots. But of course, there's no reason why the people that are being embalmed would not be a representative sample. So from this, it looks like, it looks like it could well be that 20 to 30 percent of people that are dying have got these clots. Correct. This is just a mind-blowing, massive, new pathology. I mean, I've heard about these clots, you know, about 18 months back then. But then when I got your email with the information, I'm just blown away. I am blown away. You can see I'm blown away by it. The magnitude of the pathology that we're talking about is immense. And in addition to the white fibrous clots, as you'll see in the slides coming up, there's been an increase in the traditional grape jelly clots and also for the phenomena of microclining as well of the blood. Yes, you did say that as well as the clots you get in this sort of coffee ground thing. Correct. And of course, coffee ground is old, old and blood. And this is classic of small, small, small thrombi, small blood clots. Correct. So we've got the two pathologies here. We've got the white ones. And we've got the microclotting as well. Now, this is an impressive study that you've done on your own volition tom. Quite impressive. Do you want to just basically talk us through as we look through? Yeah, I did the study from December 8 until January 8, so I just finished about a month ago. And I used a two-prong approach, John, for the study. I used a top-down approach by sending it to 50 national, regional and state funeral director associations, each with hundreds of members under them, funeral directors and Yebhawars. But I also used the bottom-up approach. I sent the survey directly to over 1700 funeral homes. I found the addresses for over 1700 funeral homes around the world. And setting the survey to them directly, it was an email with a link to a survey monkey survey. And the survey is really easy to take. This year's survey was 12 questions. Last year was seven questions. It only takes about three or four minutes to take. And when I set up the questions, John, I made sure that I kept the survey as unbiased as possible. Nowhere in the survey questions, nor in the survey instructions, do I ever mention the words COVID or COVID vaccine? I only asked the embalmers, what are you seeing? When did you see it? And how much are you seeing? What percentage of the corpses contain these clots? So we try to keep it as unbiased as possible. And the first question we ask the embalmers, by the way, that's not shown in the screen here, is where are you from? So in the UK, for example, be which country in the UK are you in? The United States would be which state are you from? And we did that. We allowed the embalmers to answer this survey anonymously, John, to keep them so they could feel comfortable answering the survey. But we wanted to check for regionality. Unfortunately, I didn't get enough responses to really determine whether there was regionally or not in terms like the bad batch theory, for example. So I didn't have any data there. But that was the way we've just we've just established that this is probably about the same prevalence in the United States, on the United Kingdom. Correct. Correct. So the second question we ask to them is this year is how long have you been in the bomber? As you can see, quite a few embalmers have at least 20 years of experience. And this is a highly experienced individuals. Yeah. So they know what the blood looked like in the years prior to COVID. They know what it looked like in the year of COVID, but no vaccines. And then they know what the what it looks like in the years of both COVID and the vaccines. Yep. Well, that's that's a good thing. Yep. We've dealing with experienced people. So the next question we ask is how many corpses a year do you embalm? As you can see, the average air is about 100 if the average the bars together. So they see bodies on a regular basis. Some of the embalmers like Mr. Richard Hirschman who's a trade embalmer in Alabama who's in the diet Sunday movie, Richard does over 300 corpses a year because he actually embalms at 12 different funeral homes. So he does lots of he'll do two or three bodies a day sometimes. But the average is 100 corpses a year. So these people they know what they're seeing. Yeah. Again, it's not a event. It's a common thing, isn't it? That's happening. Correct. We ask them again this year. Yeah. Did you observe the white fibers clots again this year in 2023? We wanted to see how that compared to 2022. As you see there, John, 197 out of the 269 embalmers that responded to the survey are indeed seeing the white fibers clots still in the end of year 2023. So that's not a good sign. So then the next natural natural question we asked John after that is well, then what percentage of your corpses are you seeing these white fibers clots? And as I said earlier, it's down a little bit from our survey last year in 2022. And that's a good thing. Yeah. Down from 30 percent to 20 percent that includes, by the way, if you average all the bars together, including the green bar with the 63 embalmers that said none. If you include that as well, you get about an average of 20 percent of the corpses that the embalmers saw the white fibers clots in. But it's incredible. This is looking like this could be the cause of one in five deaths. Well, look over there on the left. You can see a 48 of the embalmers saw them between 21 to 40 percent of their corpses. Another 29 embalmers saw these white fibers clots between 41 to 60 percent of their corpses. 11 embalmers saw them between 61 to 80 percent of their corpses. And then we have six embalmers that said they saw them between 81 to 100 percent of their corpses. So it's telling me, John, this is not a rare phenomenon. These things are prevalent. So it's quite an, and said earlier, they've never saw these clots prior to 2020. Incredible. Shocking. We also asked the embalmers about microclotting. And they don't describe it microclotting. As you said, they call it what looks like coffee ground. That's exactly what it looks like. Yeah. Yeah. As the blood's draining off the corpse and they're trying to get the from out to hide in, they'll see what looks like coffee grounds in the blood. They also call it dirty blood. Yeah. And we asked the embalmers, did you see that in 2023? And look at the results there, John. 212 of the 269 embalmers. 79 percent are seeing this phenomenon in 2023. Now this phenomenon of coffee grounds, they might have seen this occasionally in people who I've blood clotting disorders prior to 2020. Correct. If you go to the next slide, that's very rarely. Yeah. That note there, yeah, they would see it very rarely. One of the embalmers, I think, told me that he would see it particularly in patients that have he chemotherapy. He'd see coffee grounds or dirty blood in them. But as you can see there, the average of all those bars is 25 percent of corpses in 2023 containing these, the microclotting, the coffee grounds or dirty blood. So that's at least a five times a quintupling of that phenomenon since the years prior to COVID. So again, look over there to the left, 58 of the embalmers saw between 21 to 40 percent of their corpses. 32 of the embalmer saw the microclotting between 41 to 60 percent of their corpses, 16 embalmers between 61 to 80 percent of their corpses. So this is an alarming, as we talked about earlier, this could be just as dangerous as these large white fibers clots. Certainly. Yeah. The microclotting occurs at the capillary level and it can block the exchange of oxygen at the lungs and then the carrying of that oxygen to all the major origins of the body, including the brain and your eyes, you have small capillaries in your eyes. So this is just as dangerous a phenomenon as the white fiber is clots. Well, we've got blood vessels going. The only part of the body without blood vessels is the very front clear part of the eye. Everywhere else has got a vascular blood supply. It's the way it goes black and drop off. Last year's survey, we asked them about the grape jelly clots. So we asked that question to them again this year. And as you can see, 40 percent of the embalmers on average are seeing the grape jelly clots in about 40 percent of their corpses in 2023. And they've not only seen more, they've actually they've increased in viscosity. They've gotten they're more like grape jam now than grape jelly. So the next question, we compared that to what they saw in the year prior to the pandemic. Yeah. And if you go to that slide, you'll see that they saw them in 30 percent. So it was still a high number, but but they're still an increase from 30 percent up to 40 percent now in 2023. So that can be alarming as well. So we're getting five times more microthwambai, the little coffee grounds. We're getting 30 percent of the the bigger clots. 30 30 up to 40 percent now. Yeah. Yeah. And we're getting 100 percent more of the white ones. So all these intravascular pathologies are massively increased. Correct. Wow. That's a percent. Yeah. One of the other things that embalmers mentioned to me throughout the year that we went ahead and asked a question on this year is about infant deaths. And you know, this is a very sad area. I guess the good news, John, is that you see the longer bars, the no bar, 184 embalmers, 69 percent said they were not seeing that. Another 25 embalmers couldn't answer the question because they were they were younger embalmers and weren't embalming prior to 2019. But only 20 percent of the embalmers said they saw an increase in 2023 in infant deaths when compared to the years prior to the pandemic. So, but that can still be alarming in and of itself. And there's actually a little bit of explanation for that. I've been told by some of the embalmers that there seem to be a lot more cremations these days of infants. So if there is a problem with the infant, obviously that evidence is being destroyed. And a lot of the embalmers have also told me that hospitals these days seem to be more prone to asking the parents if they want to let the hospital handle the um disposal of the remains of the child. Yeah. So I think some of the embalmers are seeing less you know, infants these days because of those two reasons. But if you go to the next slide, we ask the infant being like up to 1 year old, you're classifying that as to them. Yeah, because we included a still war still warrants in their aunt's sids as well. You know, because there's been cases of sids where certain infant deaths right in the crib. Yeah, I've passed away unfortunately. And we know John that the uh, spike protein from the uh, medical intervention has been found in the breast milk of women going to the child. It's also being found, I believe in the delivered placentas, you know, after the woman delivers the child, they've found the spike protein in that as well. So this is really unfortunate if the spike protein is getting through from the mother to the infant. It's quite an unfortunate situation. The next slide tells you of the of the 20 percent who did see that the uh, an increase in infant deaths in 2023 compared to the pre-COVID years. They saw an increase of about 25 percent. So excluding that blue bar, if you don't average that one in, if you start with just the yellow bar down and average those together, you get a 25 percent increase in infant deaths for just those that saw the increase. So not a good thing. Not good at all. Yeah. Our last question on this year is surveyed John dealt with age stratification. We did not get a chance to ask the embalmers last year about that. And I wasn't too surprised at the result here. You would expect probably to see uh, we asked them, uh, did you see an increase in the clots in 2023 of all types? You know, grape jelly, white fibrous clots, the microclotting, in any particular age group. And we asked them to mark all age groups that apply. So they can mark multiple answers on this one. And as you can see, the longest bar there's in the 66 to 80-year-old age group. Not too surprised at that because as people get to that age, they start to have problems, you know, with cholesterol plaque build up in their system. But I am a little bit disturbed, John, by that 36 to 50-year-old bar. It's a pretty long bar there. 89 of the embalmers saw an increase in the clotting in clots. Yeah. And you know, this is the age group. You don't normally associate these people with having heart attacks and strokes. Usually that starts happening when you're in your late 50s, early 60s. You're there. But now, you know, and this information, this data actually dovetails very nicely are very closely to what Edward Dowd's been finding in the insurance industry. He's been taking a look at both USA and UK, death and disability data. And he's found a tremendous increase over the last three years in that particular age group of 36 to 50-year-olds. So the data that the embalmers are supplying to me dovetails very closely to the insurance, death and disability data from Edward Dowd. And we also know that there's been an increase in excess deaths certainly in the UK, nationally, in that age group as well. Same here in the United States, we've had, you know, at least 10 percent excess mortality over the last three years in the United States. And in most countries, Western countries around the world, surprisingly, we haven't seen much excess mortality at all in African countries that had very little uptake on the medical intervention. Yes. It's a lot of extra people dying and you've just identified yet another correlation at all. We're getting a lot of correlations, as you say. Now, this is from in Bahamas. In the UK, I think we're doing less post-mortems now. Is that the same situation in the States? It is, unfortunately. There seems to be a lot less autopsies done. Yes. And it's surprising in it because if you were the parent of a 20 or 30-year-old that was in great shape and then they died suddenly, when you want autopsy performed on your... Absolutely. ...child? Yeah, I would too. Otherwise, you're going to spend the rest of your life wondering what the heck. Yes. But I believe that a lesser foul play suspected or maybe like overdose on drugs, you know, where they do toxicology, then coroners and medical examiners will not take close looks at the vascular system. They may look closely at the heart, but not at the rest of the vascular system. So the embalmers I'm talking to believe that there are a lot of the medical examiners are missing these clots and the embalmers are the ones finding them, John. I think that's true because the embalmers are looking at all of the circulatory system because the flushing it out, whereas in the autopsy situation you might just be taking a slice. For example, a coronary artery. I mean, the post-mortems I've been to, they don't like slice open the arteries and look at the inside, you know, it's not... That's not common. And I think it's just saying like, you know, thrombosis or embolism or something like that. They don't describe, I believe, the type of clot, whether it was a grape jelly or a white fibrous clot or micro clotting that they saw. They just generally label it as thrombosis. So unfortunately, I don't think we're getting good, you know, stratified data in terms of off-the-desertificates from coronary reports on exactly what types of clots they're pulling out with people. Even some... I'm still surprised that pathologist Arn Bounsen up and down about this saying just a minute there's a new disease here because, you know, if you discover a new disease, you can call it... You can... You can... Can't... Campbell disease, you know, you... You know, you think they've discovered something new that'd be absolutely chomping at the bit to write a paper about it. Well, you know, it's hard to find something if you don't go looking for it, John. Yeah. And like I said earlier, I haven't... I wouldn't call it necessarily a scandal, but that's the first word that kind of comes to my mind. Yeah. When I first did this survey and sent out to the world the 50 Fuehler Director Association and the 1700 Fuehler Homes around the world, I started the survey on the 8th of December for the Smokes Current Survey. And after about five days, John, I only had about 14 responses of my Survey Monkey Collector. I said, this is terrible. What's going on here? I should have a lot more responses than this. So I had a list of the 30 U.S. State Fuehler Director associations and I had the survey too. I picked the top 30 U.S. states by population. Yep. And I called each one of them. They're telephone. And I talked to either their president or a secretary or somebody else in their office. They said, hey, could you please forward that survey that the email I sent you last week, with the link to our survey down to your embalmers? Yep. And well, God bless the Pennsylvania Fuehler Directors Association, John. Exactly as I asked. Because I got up the next morning and I saw 93 responses from embalmers in my Survey Monkey Collector. And they were all from one state, Pennsylvania. I then got up the next day and I saw 32 more responses from embalmers. And they were all from Pennsylvania again. So in two days, I got 125 responses from embalmers in just a single U.S. State. And it told me two things, John. It told me, first of all, that embalmers, they wanted to tell you what their status on the room. If they feel like they have their permission from their Fuehler Director Boss or from their State Fuehler Directors Association. Yep. But it also told me something else. Remember, there were 29 other Fuehler Directors associations here in the United States that I sent that email to. So they must not have sent it down to their embalmers. They must have suppressed deleted my email and not forwarded it to their embalmers to take. So it's telling me that there's a terrific suppression going on at the either the Fuehler Directors Association level or the Fuehler Director himself not pushing the survey down to their embalmers to take. But the data you have collected is somewhat representative of the world really because we've got data from the UK, which is consistent. Some data from Australia, a little bit from New Zealand, a little bit from Canada. And the little bit that is getting through is essentially consistent, is it, Tom, with a number of numbers? It is. I've got very poor response of the, frankly, out of the UK and Australia and New Zealand. It seems to me that the fear factor is even worse there in your areas of the world than it is in the United States or Canada. The bulk of the response it did come from the United States and Canada. But and I have two theories why that might be, John. If you're a lot of these Fuehler Director Association presidents are Fuehler Directors themselves, you know, they elect one of their own to be the head of their state association. Would you want to participate in a survey if you think that there might be a link between the medical intervention and the formation of these white fibrous clots, you know, or the microclotting and all these issues have been popping up the last three years. So especially if you mandate that all the employees of your Fuehler home take the medical intervention. You know, you might be sending yourself up for a lawsuit. So the other reason I think is, as I said earlier, 80 percent of Americans here took at least the first two medical interventions. So there might be a little personal cognitive dissonance going on where they may not want to know the answer themselves to the question. So yeah, one of the other proof I have by the way in your country is when I sent the survey to like six national regional and Fuehler Director associations in the UK, London has their own. There's a British Institute of Enbalmers. There's also a UK national association of Fuehler Directors. Well, the UK National Association of Fuehler Directors John sent me back an email saying that they were going to decline participating in the survey. They said, we'll let the British Institute of Enbalmers answer for us. Well, I already sent an email to them asking them to participate in the survey. What would be the harm in the UK, you know, national association of Fuehler Directors forting my survey down to their hundreds of Fuehler Directors and Bomer members and crave them to take the survey? Because like I said, the survey itself was non-controversial. It only asked the farmers, what did you see? When did you see it? And how much did you see? Yeah, but maybe there's just tremendous reluctance to take the survey. The other thing that's in my mind is if these things that develop thing, especially over a period of time, they've got to be causing symptoms and you would think that the radiologists and the surgeons and you know, all the doctors doing the investigations would be seeing these things as well and saying, oh, just a minute, there's a new disease process here, but it just doesn't seem to be happening. Well, people are coming in to the doctor with conditions, but I think sometimes they're being misdiagnosed or the doctor is steering them away from what the real diagnosis might be. And I think one of the reasons there is, as we know, the medical system to a certain extent, John, unfortunately, is captured. They've had carrots and sticks along the way, right? For example, here in the United States, we have anthem, blue cross, blue shield, health coverage. And they, for every doctor that can get at least 75 percent of his patients to take the medical intervention, they get paid $250 per injection. So if you had 100 patients, that would be $25,000 in your pocket to get very much $25,000. And then of course on the opposite, then they have sticks as well. If these doctors, if they stand up and say anything negative about the medical intervention, then they can have their licenses pulled or board certifications taken away from them. So it's an unfortunate thing of carrots and sticks. And by the way, we're seeing the same thing happening in regulatory agencies as well. Both last year, when I completed the survey last year, I sent the USA portion of the results last January to the FDA. They had a meeting of their vaccine related biological products, advisor committee on the 26th of January of last year, 2023. I actually asked to speak in that meeting. They had an hour, set aside for oral presentations. But there was 20 speakers allowed and there was a lottery ensued and I didn't get a chance to speak. But I did submit my information in a written format last year, John. And I did, I got a tracking number from the FDA. But throughout the entire year of all last year, I'd never heard once from the FDA or the CDC. So I'm not holding my breath, but as soon as I had the results for this survey done on the 8th of January, the very next day on the 9th of January, I packed up all my results, including the presentation that I just showed you. And also all the survey monkey data and I had all the files I used to collect the data, sent that off to the FDA, CDC, and NIH again this year. And hopes that they will do something. Because as a retired Air Force major, I shouldn't have to do this, right? This is their job to do. They should be in this and see if there's any possible link between the medical intervention and this unusual clotting that we've been seeing going off for the last three years. So I think it's just a shame that they haven't done it. And of course, you've got you to some extent, despite the difficulties you've identified, are able to say how many white clots there are, but of course you can't put the other variable on that with the amount of vaccines and the time-since vaccines, but they can. They can do that. They have that data. Correct. They won't share with anybody publicly. It's just quite incredible. I mean, this is a completely new pathology. It's only been identified by people like yourself, by talking to ambassadors. It's just just absolutely staggering that this would be happening. Now, there are a few, like I said earlier, the some of the embalmers are actually human directors themselves. They're a few directors, and they do their own embalming. Well, one of the ones that's in the Diet Suddenly Movie, she is in that role. So she gets a chance to communicate with the families of a deceased. And she says that every time she finds the white-fibreous clots, she'll go and ask the family if the deceased did your loved one get the medical intervention. And she says 100 percent of the time, John, without fail, the answer is yes. So I know that's just anecdotal, one person, but it is kind of a stunning thing to discover. So that anecdotal report should be an operational hypothesis that should be tested, because the FDA and the CDC and the regulatory agencies in my country, they have this data. Not only are they not analyzing it themselves, they won't let anyone else analyze it for them. Yeah, I totally agree. And you know, here's the problem, John. If the MRNA technology with the liponatal particle delivery system is responsible, and I'm not saying if, I'm not sure, you know, we'd like to say correlation is not necessarily causation, but if it is responsible for all this unusual blood clotting we're seeing as well as things like turbo cancers, miscarriages, hot fat, no damage, myocarditis, all these things. If it is, we've got a problem, because big pharma is getting ready to unleash a whole bunch of MRNA-based shots next year. It's trying to, you know, they want to do the flu shot, the RSV shot, the single shot. Moderna has about 40 of these MRNA-based shots in the pipeline over the next few years to push out on the world. So I am actually calling for a moratorium. I think that we need to do more of an investigation to check and make sure that these medical interventions, that this technology is indeed safe before we decide that we're going to pump it into, you know, not just hundreds of millions, but even billions of people around the planet. I too call for a moratorium because we've got enough data now to raise significant questions, absolutely must be answered. In my country, I think it's high-well science parking, Oxford, a new plant to build 250, generate 250 million doses of Moderna MRNA. You know, and people, they may ask, okay, we talked about 10 percent excess mortality earlier on, and people say, well, I'm not seeing that 10 percent excess mortality. Well, it's actually subtle at the individual level. Here in America, we're a country of 300 million people, and about 3 million of us died every year before the pandemic. Well, if we've had about 10 percent excess mortality the last three years. So 10 percent of 3 million people dying is an extra 300,000 people dying per year. That's 300,000 extra people dying a year. But excess mortality to the individual means, instead of you seeing 10 people dying this year, you see 11 people dying this year. That's 10 percent excess mortality, right? 11 versus 10. Are you really going to notice 11 people dying this year versus 10 dying last year? Probably not, right? So that's why it's so subtle at the individual level, but when you aggregate it up to large populations, it becomes staggering numbers, like 300,000 extra Americans dying every year. That's what's going on. The other thing that I get, thousands of messages, literally thousands, people dying at times when you wouldn't expect them to die. Young people dying middle-aged and older people who perfectly fit, no pathology at all. Mr. Ritcher, for first one, talk to me. Yeah, Richard Herschmann, talked to me the other day on the phone, and unfortunately he had to involve a, out of the respect for the family, I won't say the exact days, but it was a girl in her teenage years, and she was riddled with the clots, John. And then he had a 31-year-old, I think, a few days after that. So it's heartbreaking, and you can understand what the involvement is going through. There's a lot of psychological damage going on here, because they're seeing this horrific phenomenon happening, and then a lot of them feel like they cannot speak out. They don't want to damage the reputation of their funeral homes. They don't want to put their own careers in danger. They see, like I said, doctors getting their licenses pulled, and their certifications taken away, so they don't want to rock the boat, but yet there's something horrific going on. And it's just absolutely cast-ine evidence. These photographs that were shown, it is incontrovertible, the evidence is there, and yet it's being ignored. That's what convinced me. I've heard about this, and I saw these photos you put together. I thought this is just a minute. This is absolutely 100 percent physical, 100 percent real. These came out of dead people's circulatory systems, and I believe it's what killed them. Well, you know, I wasn't sure when I started the survey. You know, I watched that died suddenly in movie, and six or seven of bombers in that movie said they were seeing these clots, and I thought there might be a bunch of kooks. So I did the survey not knowing what kind of results I was going to get. Well, I got the results of my first survey, and I saw my goodness. You know, 67 percent of the bombers are seeing this phenomenon, and they're seeing it in like 30 percent of their corpses, you know, now 20 percent of their corpses. It was mind-blowing to me. It's just spectacular. In a waffle way. What are you trying to do, Tom? I'll do a quick video where I just show some of those photos if that's all right. Then play this whole thing if people want more detail. And, well, thank you for what you've done. It's just the really impressive piece of citizen science, but by someone with the mathematical and statistical data and analytical skills to do it in such a convincing way. Well, my hope is that I don't have to do it next year. I'm hoping that the FDA and CDC will go off get off their rear ends and do it themselves and give us some good data because they really should be doing that. They're the professionals, not me. I just took it all myself. I retired. I had the time to do it. I was glad to. I was curious, too, John. I wanted to know the answer to the question. I've got family members who've taken the medical intervention. I want to know if they're in danger. And we simply don't know the timescale. You know, we've got some small intimation that the numbers have gone down in 2023 when there was less boosters, but we simply don't know. Are these things forming over days, weeks, months, years? Yeah. More research needs to be done. Like I said, the monitors are speculating maybe six to 12 months in order for these things to grow large enough to stroke you out or give you a heart attack. But that's just that's based upon the data we've collected and that's that's not, yeah, for sure. Yeah. So I mean, that means we've had a booster campaign in autumn in the UK. We can look forward to more of these things throughout 2024. Well, the data would seem to indicate that, John, unfortunately. We hope not, but I'm pleased that people like you are keeping a close eye on it, so I'm going to keep us informed. We'll watch you next step. Just continue to go. Thank you so much for giving me the platform to. I'm hoping that people like Russell Brando, I know follows you and people like Joe Rogan, maybe even Tucker Carlson, we'll see our interview together and get on their platforms as well. And we'll get Tom on this matter. Mainstream media is not going to do this. We need to get this out there. This is people's lives. This is, no, people sometimes tell me off-tongued for being a bit frivolous about things, but I'm not. This is, I couldn't feel stronger about this. And this is a phenomena that's a little bit different than myrcharditis or tinnitus or the other because you can see the evidence right here. It exists. And when people see it, a picture is worth a thousand words. Yep. Yep. Is that in your hand there from one person do we know, Tom? Yes, that was taken out of one corpse by Richard Hirschman. Correct. Major, thank you. My pleasure, John. And let's talk again soon. We'll do. Thank you."
Does the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine cause blood clots? | DW News,DW News,2021-03-13,Xf8NRaFSqwU,"One also has to understand that this clotting occurs also without a truck. If all the vaccinations would cause clotting, we would have seen it right away. So the question is, is there anything with some of the vaccines or with this specific batch that is currently under investigation? What I know right now, it does not look that this is the cause. And what we also need to understand is that COVID, the disease COVID, obviously also induces clotting of the body. And this risk is much higher than what we can estimate if from the understanding that I have, I do not think that there is a massive effect of the vaccine on the clotting system. Vaccines have this short-term side effect. So if you have received a flu shot, for example, you have the pain in the arm, you may have so-called flu-like symptoms. So I think it's showing that the body is reacting to the vaccine. If you would have a lot of vaccines available, obviously that would be very easy. We say, okay, just to wait, put that on a hold, we would just use another one. And then, you know, that's the Johnson-Johnson is coming out. And maybe Sputnik will be approved. And so we will have more vaccines available in the future right now, we don't. And unfortunately, it is a race against the mutation of the virus, which is a normal biological process. But if we are able to really vaccinate people as quickly as possible, ideally on the globe level, then we can win that race, that we are faster than the virus. I think it will affect the programs. It started when there were concerns about data in the 65 years and older people. We're saying that we just don't have enough data whether the vaccine is actually effective. So we lost several weeks there before we got the data from Sputnik and the UK. And that clearly showed that this vaccine is very effective. And there was a certain reservation from the public to say, like, I don't want that drug. And so that's why pretty much that drug was not as much used as it could have been. So yes, we're losing a time. And obviously this new stories or reports of the side effects will not help. It will really put a break on the programs. And we have to probably use more weeks to get everyone vaccinated that would like to be vaccinated. Yes, it was the right decision. And every country and other countries are looking at this too. Are evaluating that data whether there's any reporting of increased clothing or any side effects. And if there's any doubts, then vaccine will not be given up to people anymore for a specific time period until that has been clarified. We should not forget that millions of people have received a vaccine and only very, very few really have been reporting serious side effects. And there are an investigation whether they actually cause really linkable to the drug or not. It shows that the scientific system is working."
EU countries to resume AstraZeneca vaccinations | DW News,DW News,2021-03-19,EG5Nv5CIw1Y,"Now, Germany, France and several other European Union countries say they are resuming AstraZeneca vaccinations after the European Medicines Agency, the EMA, said the vaccine is safe and effective. After a review, the EMA concluded that the vaccine was not associated with an overall increase in the risk of blood clots. More than a dozen European countries suspended AstraZeneca vaccinations after some recipients developed clots. During Germany, the government and public health authorities have been under fire now for weeks over the sluggish vaccination rollout. Less than one in ten people in Germany has received the first dose of the vaccine. Some say the delays are damaging Germany's reputation for efficiency. A widespread sigh of relief after the European Medicines Agency declared the AstraZeneca vaccine safe and effective. German Health Minister Jens Spahn called it good news and announced the country would be resuming vaccinations with AstraZeneca. Our joint goal of the federal government and all 16 states is to start vaccinating again in Germany with AstraZeneca during the course of the day. Spahn said the EMA's assessment confirms that the German government was right to press pause on AstraZeneca vaccines and await the outcome of the agency's investigations. Doctors will now have to inform patients about the possibility of rare blood clotting disorders, said the head of Germany's institute for vaccines. The committee has found that the risk-to-benefit ratio is still favorable and therefore vaccinations can continue. However, there will be a warning, and it is important to us that it is a warning that draws attention to the particular symptoms that can occur in very rare cases. The AstraZeneca shot is essential for the success of Germany's vaccination plan. The rollout has so far been sluggish, especially compared to countries such as Israel and the UK. Only 3.7 percent of Germany's population has been fully vaccinated, and around 8.4 percent has received a first shot. The government strategy relies on the uptake of AstraZeneca deliveries expected over the next few months, up to almost 17 million doses in the second quarter of the year. Germany also wants to start vaccinating in doctors offices by mid-April, a plan that is highly reliant on the AstraZeneca shot being available. The government will now also have to work to ensure that Germans don't lose trust in the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. A loss in trust could endanger Chancellor Angela Merkel's pledge to have given all adults in Germany the chance to get vaccinated by the end of summer. Now Germany has faced criticism for being slow to vaccinate, even before the AstraZeneca shot was paused. DW's chief international editor Richard Walker spoke with Foreign Minister Haiko Masu, who says it is crucial to get more people vaccinated quickly. It's important that we step up the pace of vaccinations over the next few weeks, because otherwise we'll lose the trust of our own population. That's the most important point for me. Of course, we would have hoped by now to have vaccinated many more people in Germany, but in April and May, we'll have such large amounts of vaccine that the numbers will go up significantly. It's also crucial to fight the pandemic in order to make sure that the hospitals don't get so full of intensive care patients that they can treat everyone. We have no illusions that the problems that have arisen, the mistakes that were made, have of course have a considerable impact on public confidence. In governments, and authorities in Germany, but also in other countries across the European Union. In that case, do you see the EU as ultimately responsible for the mistakes that were made when ordering the vaccine? I think everyone knows that mistakes have been made at every level. It's a process that we hadn't been through before. I hope that we never, ever end up in another situation like we had last year all over the world, and of course, especially in Europe. So yes, mistakes were made at every level. European, national, right down to the regions of individual member states. And we all have to do everything we can to make clear that we have learned from our mistakes. Right now, many are talking about a systemic conflict between democracy and autocracy. Do you see this as a dangerous example for those who might think the Chinese or the Russian way is better? I don't think so at all. People in Europe and in other liberal democracies know what the freedom is worth to them. And it's our job to make sure that democracies are in a position not just to deal with a challenge like that, but also to master it. I'm convinced that we will achieve that. That in the course of this year there will be many examples all over the world that make it clear that it's nonsense to say that an authoritarian regime with all its repressive capabilities can fight a pandemic better than a democracy with freedom and human rights. Let's bring in our political correspondent, Thomas Sparrow. Now, good morning, Thomas. We heard the foreign minister, Haiko Maz, they're saying Germany has to vaccinate quickly. Yet if we look at what happened with the AstraZeneca shot that it was suspended and then reinstated, how difficult do you think it'll be to restore confidence in this vaccine? It'll certainly be very difficult to restore confidence not only in that specific vaccine, but also in Germany's overall vaccination program, which as you mentioned, Sumi has been very slow indeed. One element with which authorities hope to regain at least part of that trust is by presenting more information about possible side effects to those who will be receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. A second element, and I think this is particularly important, is by making that vaccine available to GPs, to family doctors who can then administer it to their own patients. You know that family doctors have already a relationship of trust with their patients. There's a longstanding relationship there, so that's, in my opinion, whether key can be to actually restore trust not only on that specific vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine, but in general about Germany's vaccination. Programming is expected that leaders both at a federal level and at a regional level will discuss the exact details of how to make it possible for GPs and family doctors to actually administer those AstraZeneca vaccines and other vaccines, as well as part of this idea to speed up Germany's vaccination program. Thomas, there is a vaccine summit taking place today. Put this into context for us. I mean, how big a setback is this entire affair around AstraZeneca to the overall world out here in Germany? Well, fortunately for German officials, it wasn't a very long setback. It wasn't a very long halt, and this is certainly something that will be positive when it comes to the overall development of Germany's vaccine rollout. But it is indeed a setback. It is indeed a problem. Already, German officials have stressed how they plan to move forward specifically in the next few days, by, for example, making sure that people who have appointments can actually go to those appointments today and those who had appointments in the last few days, which had to be cancelled because of the halt that those appointments can then be followed in the next few days or in the next few weeks. Again, the important element here is that that halt, that temporary halt, was actually a very short one. But it is a question as to what it means for the overall promise that German authorities have made, the overall promise that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has stressed that every German adult will receive an offer to get a vaccination by the end of the summer, so in the next six months. And AstraZeneca, as I have already pointed out, plays a very important role in this overall development and in this very important promise that the German Chancellor has made. Our political correspondent Thomas Sparrow, thank you so much."
"WHO, AZ vaccine safe and effective",Dr. John Campbell,2023-02-08,onNe5VMQAwQ,"Oh, welcome to the day's talk Wednesday, the 8th of February. Now, I've been looking at the World Health Organization information about vaccines just today, just in the last few hours. And here we have their report on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Now, this is what they're saying about it. This is what you need to know. Now, this is the world. So World Health Organization speaking to the world, talking about the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. And they say this, the vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 and over. That's what the World Health Organization has on its website now. That's what they're saying. Now, the reason this is so important is not because we're giving our AstraZeneca in the West, we've given that one up a long, long time ago. But as Covis Shield made at the Serum Institute in India, it's the same Adina virus vector vaccine. So, and this is from the WHO site. So the WHO are saying Covis Shield vaccine, the Indian DNA Adina virus vector vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 18. And over. Now, of course, I'm not allowed to disagree with the World Health Organization, but we can look at some other information. Now, this comes from the British Heart Foundation. Now, quite why the British Heart Foundation has taken upon itself to be a massive supporter of mass vaccination. I don't really know. But it does seem to be if you look on its site. So there's the link to its site there. Now, this is the question from the British Heart Foundation website. Is the AstraZeneca vaccine still being used in the UK? Is the question? And of course, we know that all civilized countries stopped this a long time ago. Well, India's a civilized country, of course, but it doesn't it's still using it. Or Western countries, it stopped using a while ago. Now, this is the answer to the question, are we still using the AstraZeneca vaccine? No, the government is not ordering future supplies of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. I'm pleased to hear. Evidence shows that the MRA vaccine Pfizer and Moderna are more effective at boosting from COVID-19. So these vaccines are being recommended for the autumn booster program. So clearly, clearly, the British Heart Foundation here is saying we're not using the Oxford Oxford AstraZeneca Dino virus vector vaccine. Do you know why not? Because we've got a better one. Really? Let's look at this data here. This is from the yellow card site. Now, this shows the total amount of vaccine doses given just for the Oxford AstraZeneca. And this shows the adverse reactions reported. So basically, you can see that since the end of 2021, we haven't been giving hardly any Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Unfortunately, some small amounts are still given later on into 2022. And if we look at the scales here, we can see that's 20,000. So sometimes 20,000 adverse reactions reported per fortnight from this vaccine. And yet, according to the British Heart Foundation, it's just because we've got a better one. There's not because there's too many side effects from the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Really don't know here. Now, why they're saying that? Now, the World Health Organization says on I quote, the vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 above now. These are the adverse reactions reported in the UK by sex. And we see that these are non-serious. And these are serious reports here. And we see that there's a lot more serious reports in women. And of course, we know particularly young women. And we know particularly Thwomba and Bollock events. So yes, of course, the Adino virus, vector, vector vaccines, of course, myocarditis and pericarditis, we know that. But they also cause a lot of Thwomba and Bollock blood clot event, as well as numerous other things, of course. So the WHO here is saying in essence that young women can be given this vaccine, despite this massive excess amount of adverse reactions. Because this is what they say in their current guidelines. It's safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 and over. And I'm showing you this data here from the yellow card reporting scheme in the UK, which has its limitations, showing that very higher level of risk in women and yet in India. Young women can still be offered this vaccine. And there's something really, really gets me about this. The idea that it's okay to give out in India, but it's not okay to give out here. That really, really gets me that. It's almost like two levels of safety standards reports by year. Well, when we're using in 2021, we see this massive amount of adverse reactions from the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. And yet it's still being advised to safe and effective by the World Health Organization in India. I can't say the WHO wrong. WHO wrong, but I can report this data. Yellow card scheme measures and healthcare products regulate your authority, COVID 19 AstraZeneca vaccine. Now, actually quite a lot of the detail breakdown where it looked at the particular diseases caused by this. I couldn't find those. They probably still are there somewhere, but I couldn't find them. All the new information seems to be to do with the booster program, but I did find this summary here. This is the total number of suspected adverse reactions in the UK. Obviously before we stopped using it 247,410 reports. That's the number of reports. A total number of reports of suspected adverse reactions, which were serious. So serious from this AstraZeneca type, Adina, virus, effective vaccine, 191,479. Of course, these are always under reported. So total number of suspected adverse reactions. And I suspect this is very conservative. 876,636. And there's another adverse reaction here that I'm not allowed to report on. So we see a bit that number. That is 1,357 from UK data. Now, of course, the population of the UK is about 67 million now, I think. Population of India is 1.4 billion. Just imagine these adverse reactions multiplied by that level of population. And a lot of them are never reported, because a lot of Indians, that 600 million Indians live in a pretty well-object poverty. And, in fact, probably more than that. When they're sick very often, they won't see a doctor let alone have access to a report. So safe and effective. The WHO are saying safe and effective for everyone over the age of 18, particularly for young women or women, but young women, especially that is simply. Now, I can't say it's wrong, but I can say that data there is that data is what it is. Quite quite incredible really. Now, the authorities, the Mechstent Healthcare Product Regulator authorities, obliged me to point out to this contextualization information here. But it doesn't alter these figures. These figures are, that the reason I put these on here like this is, these are screenshots direct from the site. So I can't be accused of misinformation. As I often am direct from the site, you don't agree with it, take it up with the Mechstent Healthcare Product Regulator Authority. Now, talking about the Mechstent Healthcare Product Regulator Agency, rather than the Authority Agency, yellow card scheme. This is what the road, don't worry if someone asked to report it. They estimate that 10 percent of serious adverse reactions are reported in 2 to 4 percent of less serious adverse reactions are reported. So that's why we know that these numbers are potentially significantly underestimated. Now, the other thing that's interesting is this is the Office for National Statistics. And they publish death by vaccination status. I want to say, published death by vaccination status. We want to know how many people are dying, vaccinated, how many people are dying on vaccinated. That way we know the protective effect of vaccines or indeed otherwise. And this data was fairly religiously published every two months. Up until, it was published sometimes, published every six weeks, but certainly every two months. Up until the last one was on the 31st of May, 2021. So the Office for National Statistics has failed to publish death by vaccination status, having published it previously very, very regularly every two months or quicker. And then all of a sudden they're not, they're not publishing this data. Nothing from the 31st of May. So that's June, July, August, September, October, November, December, January. So that's five, six, that eight months we haven't had that data for. Why not? Why is this data not being published when it was published every two months? Why is it not being published? Anyway, and a completely separate matter. Here's the latest death figures for the United Kingdom. Overall, and we see that basically throughout 2022, the black line is what we would expect. That excess deaths are. There's been a higher number of deaths than expected. This looks like it's below here, below the dotted line, but of course we have to remember the five year average for the weeks one to eight in 2022, affected by the COVID-19 wave in early 2020, and where a lot of people died. So that increased that average. So basically it's clear that there's been excess deaths for all of 20 or pretty well, we can say, certainly since they are about March, February, March, 2022. And here's a blow up of that. These excess deaths have just continued month after month now. The very latest is that actually the excess deaths are relatively low this week. This is the weekend in the 27th of September. Let's hope that is a trend and not a blip, but we do see that excess deaths, blue COVID deaths, green non-COVID deaths have been high for all this time. And yet no satisfactory explanation. We looked at estimate, for example, who asked questions in the house. And the minister said, well, this is everywhere. So it's not a problem, completely nonsensical answer, ridiculous answer. We haven't got no satisfactory answer to this. Yes, problems in the health service, the parts of it, but not all of it. We know it's not all of it from the College of Emergency Physicians. Now, MIA vaccine serious adverse events. Now, this is from this reanalysis of the original phase three trial data, which is probably still about the best we've got actually, because the government's as we've seen isn't publishing data lately for the last eight months. Not published the data. So let's go back to this. In the Moderna trial, it was a one in 622 at an adverse reaction of serious, what was the phrase serious adverse reaction of interest or something like that? Anyway, a significant adverse reaction. Pfizer it was one in 990 combined. It was one in 800 over the placebo baselines. Do check out the paper there. It's a peer reviewed paper reanalysing the initial trial data. Now, these are the latest figures from the health security agency to the drug committee on vaccination. We looked at before the numbers needed to vaccinate. So how many people do you need to vaccinate to stop one hospitalizer? Table three of this report. Check it out for yourself. The reference is always there. Hospitalizations for different programs. So just I've looked at this example before 20 to 29 years of the at the autumn booster. People in no risk group you'd have to vaccinate 169,000 of them. 169,200 to prevent one hospitalization. You have to vaccinate 706,500 to prevent one serious hospitalization requiring oxygen therapy or greater interventions. As we said, oxygen therapy is given out frequently in hospitals. Even in a risk group. So we can see that conservatively speaking you if the vaccine has a significant event of interest in more than a thousand. It's still and you're only preventing you need to give 7500 vaccinations. So presumably that's 7.5 significant adverse reactions to prevent one serious hospitalization. The ratio of 7 to 1. And that's the ratio of working out for yourself 169 to 1. That's the ratio of 706 to 1. So what about what about more risk groups? Fifty to 59 year old age groups. If there's no people have no comorbidities in the God of vaccinate 43,000 to prevent one hospitalization and you've got to vaccinate 256,400 to prevent one serious hospitalization. Even in a risk group, you've got to vaccinate 3,100 to prevent one hospitalization but the risk is still one in a thousand. Of the serious adverse events of special interest. So again, I don't think you need to tell me that that number is about 3 times higher. It's just amusing. So let's see what the great and the good have got to say about this. Here we have someone you may well recognize. We know that having the third vaccination booster is a very important part of immunity to COVID and it provides additional protection even if people have had COVID or had their first vaccination. So the program, the autumn program which includes the ability for everybody to come forward is coming to an end on the 12th of February and I'd encourage anybody who's not taking up the offer to do so before then. You see that anyone includes people in this category. You know, is this seriously suggesting that we've vaccinate 706,000 people to prevent one case of hospitalization or serious hospitalization requiring oxygen. That's exactly what he's just been suggesting. I'm not allowed to say is wrong but I'll leave you to think how rational that is. So as we've just noticed deaths in the UK are actually down a little bit which is good news. Let's hope this trend really continues because it's been alarming terrifying actually. At the moment deaths are only 2.1 percent above the five year average. So down still excess deaths but down quite a bit. Now again on a completely separate topic we're a bit disparate today but some people have been making some profits. Now this is from Reuters you might not be able to see this but fires a vaccine with bio-entech that made a 37. So 37.81 billion dollars. 37.81 million dollars in 2022 alone. Now who's paid for that? Well you and me have paid for that because we're tax payers. The ordinary rank and file have paid for that. The elites make the decision. The elites rate in the money you and me pay. And potentially suffer adverse events. Fies are anti-viral treatment to mere 18.93 thousand million dollars. The Derner 18.4 billion. Merck anti-viral 5.68 bio-entech 4.6. We could go on and on and on. This is there. I put the reference. It's a three really available thanks to Reuters. Do check it out for yourself. Western drug makers are estimated to have bought in about a hundred billion hundred thousand million dollars in revenue in 2022 alone. Bay four by us. And we have various things we could be spending money on at the moment but that's what our governments choose to spend the money on as we've just seen supported and encouraged by our chief medical officer. I'm going to leave it there because I'm not allowed to disagree but thank you for watching."
Dr H Addresses the Blood Clot Worries Related to the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID Vaccine | GMB,Good Morning Britain,2021-03-15,CgQB9fl5Fto,"There's another issue causing concern this morning, and that is about the vaccine, and in particular, Dr Hilary, the AstraZeneca vaccine, because Ireland's authorities have decided to suspend the rollout of AstraZeneca, and this follows a number of countries, the Netherlands has become the latest country to spend use of the vaccine. And this is all down to an incidence in Norway, isn't it? Where the AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked in some way to blood clots. Now, what is the evidence, and is this causation of correlation just to coincidence, or a serious cause for concern? It's almost certainly a coincidence. What we know is that whenever we have a medicine, or a vaccine, or a homeopathic remedy, or a herbal remedy, there is a system in place whereby any possible side effects can be reported and investigated. It's absolutely right and reassuring that we've got an investigation in place to look at the level of blood clots that have been reported both in Norway and Ireland, and in all the EU countries, UK and around the world. Now, blood clots are very common anyway. They happen all the time. They happen as a result of taking the oral contraceptive pill. They take place after trauma to the body where blood vessels are damaged. We see thousands of heart attacks and strokes every year because of blood clots. So there are going to be blood clots anyway before vaccines ever rolled out. So we're looking at the level of blood clots that are being reported as a precautionary measure. And actually, all the data that we have so far is that the level of blood clots is lower than it would be before vaccinations. So that's in itself reassuring. And that's across all genders. It's across age groups. It's across batches of vaccine, and it's across the different countries. So it's highly reassuring that at the moment there's no evidence of any causal link between the vaccine and blood clots. But it's a very good thing that we're looking into it. It is a good thing, but the trouble is that any report of something negative is going to affect confidence in the vaccine. How does the author, how do gps like yourself maintain that confidence? Because it's the vaccine rollout, which is a number one saving lives. And b, enabling us all to live a normal life again. Well, what we try and do is we give people the facts that they can make informed choice all the time. So when we discuss the vaccine, we say, we'll look, you know, we know that COVID-19 definitely causes inflammation in blood vessels and causes blood clots. In fact, in critically ill people, people with cancers, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis and blood clots is about 37 percent. It's huge. Now, we're talking about 15 cases in 23 million doses, 15 cases of deep vein thrombosis and 22 of pulmonary embolism, where blood clots are in it. So tiny amount. Normally, we see about one to two per thousand population. We're seeing, according to my figures, one in 160,000, tiny compared to what we normally see. So I think that's highly reassuring. So I think gps go about talking to patients about what are the risks of COVID? Very high. Yeah. What are the risks of vaccination extremely low? What would I do? The risk of blood associated with vaccination is really high. There's no causal link. There's no theoretical reason why it would cause blood clots because it doesn't contain the COVID-19 virus. So we try and do a job of education and persuasion rather than sort of forcing people to have vaccine. It's a big week for vaccines this week as well, of course. Absolutely. It's a very successful rollout, but we're set to sort of increase the rollout and the, and the jabs considerably aren't we? We're increasing supply. Yes. It's a big week for me personally, just like, you know, I wouldn't normally divulge personal medical information. And this is a one off. But I have my vaccine book this week. Excellent. And I will be going ahead with it because I think it's, you know, the overwhelming evidence is that it is going to save lives. If you look at the data sheet that comes with any medicine that you're given, it issues reams of information, and one case of anything reported anywhere in the world has to, by law, be reported on that data sheet. So, people look at these things and get a little bit worried, and it's the GP's job to persuade people that actually, it's a good thing that we look at the side effects of everything, and it has to be reported for safety reasons. So, the safety regulations are in place for that reason, and they're very reassuring to know. But I'm glad you're having your vaccine. We still have high rates of COVID-19. We're still seeing loss of life and hospitalizations, and we still have to take it very seriously, but the vaccine is the way out of this. Absolutely. In the future, we'll need to tweak those vaccines to make sure we deal with new variants which could be potentially dangerous, but Nadhim Zahawi has said there's more supplies of vaccine coming on stream which can only be a good thing."
First High Court case,Dr. John Campbell,2023-11-08,lDWdXXclQvs,"Well, well, welcome to today's talk Wednesday, the 8th of November. Now, several of the more serious news outlets in the United Kingdom are reporting on a high court case. This relates to the AstraZeneca vaccine and a specific side effect, the vaccine induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, so where there is blood clots and where there are low platelet levels. Of course, we know this was associated with several very serious adverse events in the UK. Now, this is probably the first of many cases, because surely it's only a matter of time until we see court cases related to other complications like myocarditis and pericarditis, like excess menstruation and unexpected vaginal bleeding and a phallaxis and other delayed hypersensitivity reactions, guion barric syndrome, bells paulzy, capillary leak syndrome, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, thrombocytopenia and even pregnancy related adverse reactions are these all still to come. Complicated because of the indemnity that our governments rushed to give the vaccine manufacturers, but let's look at some of the detail on that now, really quite fascinating and I think probably the shape of things to come. Vindication for those of us that have been asking questions for some time now is probably just around the corner. Now this is a landmark legal case. Oxford AstraZeneca COVID jab was defective. Is the contention. 8th of November 2023, quite a few outlets. Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine has been branded as defective. Claims of efficacy were vastly overstated and as we'll see that this is in fact the case, you could argue it was very vastly overstated. High court test case. Now this is Mr. James Scott who had a bleed on the brain unfortunately. Suffered a significant permanent brain injury now unable to work, nearly died in fact. Vaccinated on the April 2021 and within a week or two we had this serious blog plot. Now the claim is under the Consumer Protection Act interestingly. So that's where this defective idea comes from. This defective idea is mentioned under the Consumer Protection Act that the vaccine was not what it was proposed to be. In other words it didn't quite have in the vial what it said on the tin is what this is arguing defective. This is the way the try to get around the indemnity that government gave them but the government is going to probably end up paying for this. It's going to cost you in the fortune probably. Anyway let's move on. argues that AstraZeneca vaccine was defective not as safe as individuals were entitled to expect. So Mr. and Mrs. Scott we were told by the government that the vaccine was safe and effective but what's happening to Jamie that's Mr. Scott has been life changing and their vaccine caused that. Pretty strong words. AstraZeneca cannot continue to ignore the circumstances in which their vaccine has caused devastating injury and loss. Our legal case will seek to hold AstraZeneca to account but we need to build a significant fighting fund to get justice. Vaccines in fact pretty well all justice in my country really is for those that can afford it. You can't really bring a case in the high court unless you've got a lot of money behind you. These individuals are presumably risking everything to do this. Second claim is from Mrs. Alpert Taylor who was a 35. Well it's not from her. Sadly it's from her widower. An inquest confirmed that she was a vaccine related serious adverse reaction. That particular serious adverse reaction. So there's two test cases here and this could pave the way for 80 damage claims around about a million pounds each related to vaccine induced phombocytopenia and phombosis. But medicines and health care products regulate your age rating so say at least 81 of these serious adverse reactions in the UK suspected to be linked to clotting and low platelets but that's almost one in five of the suspected individuals. So for this particular severe adverse reaction so at least five times more than that had a severe adverse reaction. And presumably these will be able to make claims as well once this test case is established. And of course once this test case is established my understanding is there's going to be a group action and there's going to be a lot of people claiming of course once it's the precedent as accepted in the United Kingdom is it going to be accepted in other countries as well. This is probably the beginning of this potential landslide to be quite honest. World Health Organization 13th of June 2022 the vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals 18 and over so that's what the World Health Organization said. This can complete contradiction to the evidence given in the high court in the UK. And of course the World Health Organization is seeking incredible new powers under the international health regulations and the post pandemic treaty that were seemed to be giving them. And yet this was the advice that they were giving. And this website there is dated as late as the 13th of June 2022. How could they possibly be saying this? How on earth could they be saying this as late as the 13th of June 2022? Quite well I don't understand how the WHO could still be saying that. It's patiently untrue. AstraZeneca last night said to the telegraph patient safety is it's highest priority. Sure. There. I can pick up my piece of paper. The vaccine. Vaxes of Vera vaccine has been shown to have an acceptable safety profile. Quite sure who it's acceptable to but presumably not the patients that were injured. Regular regulators around the world consistently stated that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risk of extremely rare potential side effects potential side effects. Well no these are actual side effects actually. These are actual side effects and extremely rare is in the eye of the beholder. But to be fair to AstraZeneca here, the regulators in my view have completely let us down. I feel personally betrayed. And as I know many of you do. Now many European countries of course ban the AstraZeneca at an early stage. Germany suspended its use in under six years in March 2021. UK stopped it for under 30s. Month after and for under 40s not until May 2021. But it carried on for a long time after that. Whereas Germany banned it in this group. And so did the memory Denmark and quite a few other countries. Freedom of information acts 148 payouts under the government vaccine damage scheme. 144 for AstraZeneca at 120,000 pounds each. Why do we only know this as a result of freedom of information? Request. Well why can't people just be have an open and honest discussion about this? Why aren't I more free to talk about it now? Very very frustrating situation. And what's that messages again released to the telegraph tour from Matt Hancock. There was concerns led by the United States authorities that it seems the government was aware of. Of course AstraZeneca never applied for a license in the United States. Could it be that they thought they wouldn't get it? So they didn't bother applying. Who knows? But they didn't. So John Bell professor of medicine Oxford University, government chief advisor on life sciences. Advisor to the joint committee on vaccination and vaccination and immunization. Again, what's that messages? So AstraZeneca have become really frazzled. These are fairly contemporaneous messages as far as I understand. They accept that their comms are a bit clunky. And they misjudge some things like clinical trial data. Right. So this is the John Bell. They misjudge some things like clinical trials data and manufacturing. How do you misjudge manufacturing? Partly because they've not done a vaccine before. Well, it's the first attempt. Quite incredible. Incredible. Right. Legal arguments. No warning of the risk of vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in the product information sheet at the time. AstraZeneca issued press release following clinical trials saying that their vaccine was between 62 and 90 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. In fact, the absolute risk reduction concerning COVID-19 prevention was only 1.2 percent. So they're saying that their relative risk reduction 62 to 90 percent. The absolute risk reduction, which is probably more useful in the real world, 1.2 percent. If we'd been told this at the time, we know we've got a new vaccine here. It's 1.2 percent effective in terms of absolute risk. Doesn't sound as quite as effective as 60 to 90 percent does it? Not quite. Not quite. And that 1.2 percent is from the prescriptions of Edson's Code of Practice Authority, check them out for yourself. Lawyers to examine government reassurance, Secretary of State for Health, and a company in department minute said this, the data so far in this vaccine suggests that there will be no adverse reactions and so no liability. There are no drugs or vaccines that work that have no adverse events. Maybe we need more doctors, nurses, pharmacists in government rather than career politicians, because to say that there will be no adverse events, I mean no. I mean no. No is an awfully big word, isn't it? Sarah, more one of the legal representatives for the injured. The group of individuals whom we represent have always been clear. They do not dabble in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. Excellent. Please do hear it. However, it is plainly factually inaccurate to claim the vaccines do know harm given the experience of our client group, the vaccine injured and bereaved. Well, of course they are injured and bereaved. Of course, there is damage. AstraZeneca made the point that measures of healthcare products, regulatory agency, granted full marketing approval for the UK based on the safety profile and efficacy of the vaccine. So answers questions to be asked of AstraZeneca, of the regulatory authorizing authorities and of the government of the time. Quite significant questions all round really. But the point is this is probably the first case and we're going to see a lot more eye strongly suspect. With the Pfizer and for the Pfizer vaccine particularly, the reason that the indemnity indemnity might not apply is that the vaccine manufacturing process used for the vaccine in the clinical trials was nearly entirely different from the vaccine manufacturing process used for the vaccine rollout. So it's quite possible to argue that it's two different products. I think there was roughly only about two to three hundred vaccines of the what we call the manufacturing process to. That we used in the trial or the rest of the manufacturing process one which is a completely different technology. So the vaccine that was trialled is arguably a different product from the vaccine that sadly I was given and many of you were given. Now just before we finish the BBC televised Andrew Bridgian speech that we covered in Parliament about excess deaths. And here's the BBC for use site. Isn't it nice to know the BBC is for us. Very very warming concept isn't it? This was released on the 3rd of November. We reviewed our use of on screen captions which were all over the place during an adjournment debate in the House of Commons trends in excess deaths. They were concerns. Yes, there were that the captions which outlined the NHS guidelines on vaccines for COVID and other diseases showed a bias against Mr Bridgian MP. Few paranoid people might have got that idea just because there was these banners plastered all over the place talking about the official advice that might have contradicted the points being made by Mr Bridgian. He was making the speech. It's normal practice to provide accurate information. Shouldn't we be so grateful shouldn't we? We're getting this accurate information and context in these debates on screen. In these cases it was an important aspect of our coverage due to the nature of the assertions being made to the public in relation to public health. Was it really? However, we accept that there was a lack of consistency in our use of these captions. And that the number posted during the speech was not proportionate nor always relevant. Which created an impression which created the incorrect impression that there was an editorial approach in relation to the views expressed. So if you watched all those banners at the BBC put on Mr Bridgian speech and you got the impression that there was an editorial approach, the BBC were taking a particular position, you were wrong. Your impression was wrong. The BBC tell us here quite clearly that it would give you an incorrect impression. And I don't want members of the public arguing with the BBC because a lot of these people have bays in journalism. You got the incorrect impression, your problem. Which created the incorrect impression that there was an editorial approach in relation to the views expressed. So it appears the BBC has no editorial approach. And then finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, we apologise. What was that BBC? Re-apologise for this and are reviewing the way we use captions in such proceedings. So is that an apology or not? To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure. But we'll leave it there. You can make your own mind up. If it was an incorrect... If you got the impression that there was a particular editorial approach, it was incorrect. There we go. We'll leave it there. I don't tell you what to think. You make up your own mind and thank you for watching."
Astrazeneca vaccine: safe or not safe? | Inside Story,Al Jazeera English,2021-04-08,mWhoCltkyvU,"RA, but still dangerous. The European Medicines Agency says the AstraZeneca vaccine for COVID-19 is linked to blood clots, but it insists the benefits aren't way the risks. So should people be worried this is inside story? Hello, welcome to the program. I'm Hashem Ahalbalah. Many countries have been relying on the AstraZeneca vaccine to get them out of the coronavirus pandemic crisis, but there have been problems from supply to side effects. Now European regulators say the vaccine can in rare cases cause blood clots, the UK's to offer alternative jab to young people who appear to be at more risk, but both the UK and EU say there are still confident in the AstraZeneca vaccines effectiveness and safety. There have been fewer than 80 cases reported in the UK, despite more than 20 million being given out, but even so, that's caused a reaction. The reported cases of unusual blood clotting, following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine, should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine. Based on the current available evidence, specific risk factors such as age, gender or previous medical history of clotting disorders have not been able to be confirmed, as the rarest events are seen in all ages and in men and women. The first possible connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clotting was made in late February, since then speculation research and reactions have been missed. Many medical bodies carried out investigations but failed to come up with a link between the jab and clotting. Even Emma Kirk, who you had just heard before, said the EMA didn't think the two were related, but more than a dozen countries temporarily suspended use of the vaccine. Austria first, then France, Spain, Germany, in Europe, and then Indonesia, Thailand, and Democratic Republic of Congo. Now, with the latest moves, many countries are introducing age limits for the drug. Australia, the Philippines, and the handful of EU countries have all halted AstraZeneca jabs for people under a certain age. Oxford University, which was behind the creation of the vaccine, continues to stand by its work. In a statement, its professor of pediatric infection and immunity said, safety has been our priority throughout the development of the vaccine at University of Oxford in 2020. And we are reassured to see that safety monitoring continues under the close scrutiny of regulators and public health authorities as the vaccine is rolled out around the world. The identification of rare cases of blood clots, which might be associated with the vaccine, shows that the safety system works and has also allowed the UK and the EU's regulators to conclude that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh the risks, putting in measures to help mitigate any possible risk. Let's bring in our guests in Cambridge. Chris Smith is consultant virologist at Cambridge University and post-cast host of the Naked Scientists. In London, Oksana Pysik is lead on the outbreak of infectious diseases for the University College London's global citizenship program. In Barcelona, Jeffrey Lazarus, head of the Health Systems Research Group, at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, welcome to the program. Chris, the finding by the European Medicine's agency now about the link between the AstraZeneca and the blood clots, this should be really bad news for a company that has been battered by a series of setbacks. I think the chief executive officer, Pasquale Sorio, has said he kind of regrets going down the path of offering a vaccine, which makes no profit for AstraZeneca, which is the decision that they took. This should be available at cost. It was a wonderful gesture. It seems to be somewhat thrown back in their face. Yes, it's tricky and and obviously one is very concerned at the moment with the concept of vaccine hesitancy. One of the crucial things about getting this over the line and getting the pandemic under control is that we have the support and trust of the general public and that translating into high uptake of vaccines, which will suppress the spread of the virus and it will translate what would have otherwise been lethal infections into non-lethine infections. With this kind of image problem that the vaccines currently laboring under, that could be a problem going forward. Oksana, what do you think would be the immediate implications of the latest finding by the EMA? Well, the EMA still has said that the benefits outweigh the risks and actually they have not defined any age-based recommendations, but countries are choosing to do so restricting to above 55 in Brussels and over 16 other countries as well. So we do see that there is a variation here in terms of the interpretation of what the European Medicine's agency has concluded as well as the UK body, the MHRA. What we see as well is that we consider the overall benefits of the vaccine, not just in terms of focusing on mortality rate, but younger people can also be affected by things like long COVID. And there was a recent study in the Lancet which showed that one in three people actually went on within six months to receive either a neurological or psychological diagnosis. And so we really do need to ensure that this vaccine rollout continues to avoid greater burden on the healthcare system. Jeffrey, how do you explain the different interpretations of both the EMA which says there is a link and the UK regulators who say that there needs to be more investigation before they establish impacts? Well, it's difficult to explain how the bodies came up with different findings, but as mentioned, the European Medicine's agency has for the second time said that this is a safe vaccine with very rare side effects and it's common to have side effects with any vaccine or any medicines. So it's completely safe to take it. Now that different European countries have defined different age groups is their decision. The important thing is that the AstraZeneca vaccine gets used and if the Europeans aren't going to use all the doses available to them, then that's more doses for the rest of the world. Chris, is it political in a way or another that the UK regulators are saying first of all, as far as the causal relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of the blood clots coming together with the low platelets which are the main reason why we're seeing those fatalities is considered plausible, plausible, however it has to be confirmed and for it to be confirmed, this could take a body of work and research and data. A good way to think about this is to look at the timeline over the life course and the risk profile. So a person who's in their 80s may have say a 10 percent or higher chance of succumbing to severe or lethal infection with coronavirus whereas someone who's 18 rather than 80 may have a 1 in a million chance of having a severe outcome if they catch coronavirus. Now if we map onto that, the vaccine. The vaccine has a side effect or complication rate potentially of about 1 in a million. That's roughly the rate at which we're seeing these blood clots that might or might not be associated but let's assume they are 1 in a million. So if we vaccinated a million people, we might therefore expect to have one person with the complications. Now if those are all 80 year olds for one person with the complications we've saved 10 percent or 100,000 lives from coronavirus. But if you contrast that with an 18 year old, we've caused one person to have complications and we've prevented one person from having complications. So that ratio of the risks versus the benefit is quite different when considered across the range of ages and it's that that has provoked the regulators to say we don't think there's a serious issue here and the fact that they've said if you've already had one dose of it, carry on and have a second dose even if you are in the 20 to 29 year age group. But because we do have alternatives and until we get the data, we don't want to hold up the vaccination process because vaccines really do matter and they do save lives therefore let's offer the people who might be at a risk a different vaccine while we simultaneously continue for those other people for whom that risk benefit analysis is absolutely clear. It's a safe, very effective in life saving vaccine. But this is the problem, Oksana, the finding of email itself is going definitely to create some problem among the people who are definitely going to be more skeptical now and this is going to create huge problems for AstraZeneca, which was hoping that it's vaccine widely touted as affordable, easy to administer, likely to compete with Pfizer and Moderna. That image itself is shattered in a way or another. Well, I think the flip-flopping certainly hasn't helped. Originally we did see that the older groups were not vaccinated due to the fact that there was the idea or the feeling there wasn't enough data on this and then that's now been reversed in the other direction. So I do think that what we, the survey so far, do you show that there is a different confidence? What's also interesting is that due to the different strategies in procurement and roll-out, the UK had at first identified less cases because we focused on vaccinating our older population first. So whereas on the continent we saw that there were certain age groups that were the elderly originally were left off and people who were in frontline positions and either in hospitals, care worker schools tended to be female. So also some of the patterns that we are looking at now may just be a result of who the vaccine was given to rather than something more significant than that. However, let's not forget there's some countries in the world who have very little or no vaccines at all at this stage. So I do think that certainly this is something that can be overcome. It is damaging but we know that it's the real and known dangers of COVID far away, any potential adverse effects really is vaccine and it fits a typical profile as well. Jeffrey, many countries are stepping in just right after the findings were released of the email saying that it's about time to start looking for options particularly for the people under 30. It's very easy, sent in practice. This means that you have to rethink your whole procedures, your whole strategy, think about alternatives, buy new medicine, which is going to be extremely difficult particularly in the EU. So if you're referring to changing the vaccine strategy, I'm not sure it's really that complicated. It just means you're using your Pfizer Moderna or your Johnson & Johnson vaccine for those younger age groups rather than AstraZeneca. And like in Spain where I am now they've limited AstraZeneca used to those age 60 to 64. So they'll use up the vaccines they have. Hopefully they'll finish the second doses for those who have only received one dose and then that will be more vaccines for the rest of the world. But I'm hoping is that we can turn this around and say given that the European Medicines Agency has said it's safe, we can use this to accelerate vaccination programs in other parts of the world which is extremely important in order to avoid variants of concern because as those variants flourish we risk that some of them may become resistant to vaccines. Chris when you have the EU purchasing 400 million doses of AstraZeneca the Americans 300 million in the past trying to be ready for the eventuality of starting the fast track vaccination campaign. What would be the reaction do you think among the decision makers now against the backdrop of the findings of the email? Well I hope they'll look at the statistics and the statistics paint a very encouraging picture. We're talking here about chance events occurring down at the level of less than one in a million to one and half a million. That's really really low and when you put this up against the fact that the complication we're talking about affects about five people in a million per year just by chance anyway and if people take the oral contraceptive pill it increases their likelihood of this happening to them by maybe eightfold and no one bats an eyelid about that sort of thing. I think that probably most of the people making decisions around this will be saying well actually statistically we're on a very sure footing here because what we absolutely know is this is a very effective vaccine and the data we're seeing coming through now show in some cases 90 percent plus protection in the most vulnerable groups and it's also very very cheap it's one of the cheapest vaccines on the market and actually has one of the longest track records because the constructs that's being used to make this vaccine has been used for more than a decade and in the fighting West Africa against Ebola that construct went into thousands and thousands of people so we've also got long-term follow-up. So there are many reasons to be reassured by these findings not least that they're being investigated properly. Oxana when you have people who have been from day one skeptical about this fourth idea about getting vaccinated against COVID-19 as a safest way and you get this whole story about AstraZeneca and the and the and the and the link between the vaccination and the blood clots. Do you have any concerns that this could unfortunately push some people to start comparing between vaccines and say you know what we think that one could be more efficient safer than the other one. Well I think that there we have to distinguish between people who are anti-vaxxers who even before the pandemic would be concerned or refuse vaccines and those who have some really legitimate questions based on on the headlines that they're seeing in the media and I think Chris really broke it down in an understandable way that you know there's just a one in a million chance of this occurring which is about the same as getting murdered or being hit by a car in the next month or so. So if we think about it that way it's it definitely I think eases the the concerns that people have. I think what's crucial though is that the public's questions on the vaccines on the data that there is transparency that scientists and the governments do address their public regularly so that that confidence that has to be rebuilt and regained. So I don't think that it is for this middle ground group who who just want to understand what it is that the the real risk is I think that that's something that healthcare professionals, pharmacist doctors can have those conversations and change people's minds that any vaccine at this stage is going to protect themselves and their loved ones because we see that there's also great data about limiting transmission. It's not just about yourself it's also about the people around you. Jeffrey this looks like a mammoth task ahead for AstraZeneca particularly when it comes to the American market the FDA is yet to authorize the emergency use and we've starting to hear reports from American officials saying that we might not use the AstraZeneca at all by the end of the day. That's right and if they don't then they will use Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson and like I said earlier that means more doses of AstraZeneca for the rest of the world. Right now the vaccine is desperately needed across Latin America in parts of Africa where they have very very low numbers vaccinated so if it means the AstraZeneca vaccine is more available than that's where that's where it should be distributed through the COVAX facility or through direct purchase. So I'm not so worried about Europe and the US right now with regards to to the AstraZeneca vaccine. I think people should get their second dose and then we have other options. It's the countries that don't have those other options because they don't have the cold chain to manage Pfizer or Moderna or because of the cost. So as long as you know it gets used you know we we we're not facing you know a severe problem with AstraZeneca. Chris the Europeans were hoping from day one that they would have a comprehensive united approach when it comes to tackling COVID-19 acquiring the same vaccine from AstraZeneca and moving forward the Germans are saying now that the alien talks with the Russians for Sputnik vaccine. Could this be an indication that we're seeing some cracks within the EU itself about dealing with AstraZeneca in the near future? I think we've seen cracks in the EU right from the get go and and I don't think that they have made themselves look particularly honorable or really bolstered their reputation internationally I think quite the opposite in fact. Interesting that they're going down the route of the Russian Sputnik vaccine though because it hasn't been approved yet that we understand that the EMA the European Medicines Agency are looking at that vaccine. It's also very closely related to how AstraZeneca's vaccine works it's a modified cold virus in fact it's a pair of cold viruses which are administered a few weeks apart it's also very similar to the Johnson and Johnson vaccine that's also still waiting for approval in the UK. What unites all these different vaccines is they're all based on modified cold viruses which are used as Trojan horses to smuggle into the body the coronavirus coat message and therefore what is happening with AstraZeneca's vaccine with this rare complication albeit at very low levels it could also affect the Johnson and Johnson vaccine it could also affect the Russian vaccine we haven't seen the data yet we haven't seen the follow-up on millions of people who've had it like have had the AstraZeneca vaccine and that may yet emerge so it may well be that we see the same trend emerging with these other products obviously we'll have to watch this space. Sana what does this leave the EU it's grappling with a third wave of COVID-19 a spike in infections death tours they be lagging far behind when in terms of vaccinating large sections of their own society they have been grappling with ways to find new vaccines could this be the moment of reckoning as far as the Europeans are concerned? Well certainly the timing isn't great as you say there's a third wave that is rolling across the continent and there are more and more restrictions coming into place just as in the UK we start to lift some of those restrictions as early as next week so in this instance they do need to be accelerating the vaccine rollout as quickly as possible as Jeffrey has highlighted however they do have a selection of other types of vaccines they could also be using but I believe that they do have to think about how to best leverage their existing public health infrastructure to upskill certain health workers and ensure that we they get as many jabs and arms as possible so that we don't end up in a situation where we have the French variant or the Spanish variant resulting in the fact of not only a combination of vaccination rate but also vaccine hesitancies so again these are all very particularly the latter is more complicated to address given some of the issues that we've discussed on AstraZeneca but I think another point as well is that outside of the UK and outside of the EU Brazil for instance being one of the hotbeds of cases at the moment and that situation is not looking good so I do think we need to zoom out and take a global approach. We definitely need to zoom out and this is going to be my question to Jeffrey about this is this whole thing has been an uncharted territory for for us and for the scientific community because they're dealing with a with with something new and they've been trying and testing new vaccines some of them using old technologies some of them using ultra modern technologies don't you think that this whole thing about AstraZeneca should be an opportunity for everyone to put into place a mechanism to monitor all the vaccines and look for any possible side effects that we might be overlooking right now. Absolutely so we have the co-vax facility which is a global mechanism for distributing the vaccines to to the poor low resource countries but we need like you say a global mechanism to oversee all the vaccines we also need that or a similar mechanism to look at production because where we've failed isn't being able to produce enough doses of the vaccines. So governments invested early in developing the vaccines and this has been one of the great scientific breakthroughs with so many successful vaccines but they have an invested at the same level in the production and we know that vaccines require dozens of components from reagents to to vials and and resins and so on so we need an overview of what what the availability of the different components are and a massive global you know pharmaco vigilance of any possible side effects since we're seeing something in the EU and the UK but we need to make sure that we're you know we're overseeing this in the rest of the world. Chris you left then 20 seconds if you don't mind what would be your message to those who bureaucrats and politicians, doctors working in different parts of the world having to make that decision about allowing their own countries to continue using AstraZeneca or not. Look at the data the risk profile is exceptionally good and the performance of the vaccine is very very high. I have no conflict of interest. I have no shares in AstraZeneca or anything like this but I do of course have a share in being a doctor myself and treating patients who are suffering with this disease which we can prevent with this vaccine. It's an excellent vaccine. Thank you very much. You did I really appreciate your messages of hope at this particular moment when people are eager to see light at the end of the tunnel Chris Smith, Oksana, Baisik and Jeffrey Lazarus.

How safe is AstraZeneca Covid vaccine & why there is no need to panic,ThePrint,2024-05-03,sDz0K6_qVJ4,"The lawsuit brought on by consumers against AstraZeneca has the Indian Internet once again up in arms about the Kovie Shield vaccine. The lawsuit and the company's admission that the vaccine could cause some quote-unquote very rare side effects has led to a political furore and unfortunately many are mistakenly coming extremely close to sounding very much like those in the pseudo scientific anti-vaccination camp. This today in 2024 is a serious cause for concern. While criticizing those in power is our right and even our obligations, I might say, there are far more valid criticisms to be levelled against the Modi government for how they handle the pandemic or the vaccines than AstraZeneca's admission of these side effects. Owing to the really large risk to public health and observing in media how these vaccine hesitant sentiments can get weaponized, vaccine risks are a subject that need to be touched upon very carefully in an informed manner. Vaccines are not without risk but generally speaking, vaccines are not risky. Adverse events as they are medically known are concerning. So first let's just look at these adverse events. What are these serious adverse events that are very rare? First of all, some people can be allergic to vaccines or ingredients used in any vaccine. These people would typically have a reaction within a couple of minutes of being administered the vaccine which is why all of us are asked to wait in the hospital after we receive our vaccine for a while. Some other side effects are also known, some get severe nausea and headache, some have diarrhea, etc. These might be purses for a day or two or maybe even a week but they will resolve by themselves. Fever is also a common symptom and this is not a bad symptom. This is a good symptom because that's what a vaccine is supposed to do. So no worries there. The identified side effects that AstraZeneca has admitted to is called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS. Thrombosis is the production of blood clots in the bloodstream and thrombocytopenia is low platelet levels in the blood. TTS can lead to production of blood clots in the body and these blood clots can travel through the blood vessels through the veins or arteries and can be life threatening especially if they reach the brain. Thrombosis is not really unheard of. It happens quite frequently in medical conditions. It can happen to people who are otherwise healthy but are injured or are pregnant or have cancer or have had a long surgery or even those who are on specific oral contraceptives. Thrombocytopenia, low blood count occurs in liver patients or those with certain autoimmune diseases. But the combination thrombosis with thrombocytopenia is not really frequently found and outside of cancer patients it's not really found much. This is of course when it is unrelated to vaccination. When TTS is induced by vaccination it is called vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia or VITT. That is the condition that is more accurate to what we're talking about and that is the one that AstraZeneca has owned up to. VITT was first identified in March 2021. It's at an anywhere from 50 to 30 to 42 days of treatment and it is largely caused due to a genetic mutation called PF4. Platelet factor 4 those with this genetic mutation tend to have a tendency to get VITT after vaccination. So firstly if it's been over a month of getting the vaccination and symptoms like stroke or you know depth have not presented themselves the vaccinated people are safe from VITT today. TTS is rare and in medical terminology very rare means extremely extremely rare like one in a million at least rare. This is even more true for VITT but what really exactly is the numerical probability? I personally like saying that a person is more likely to get hit by lightning than experience and adverse effect due to vaccine. This is not a new comparison or original many medical professionals have long used this lightning comparison to indicate the low risk of adverse events from any vaccine and here's what studies have actually shown. A 2021 UK study found 79 cases of VITT in over 20 million vaccinations of Kovie Shield of AstraZeneca. Another 2021 study showed 8 cases in 17 million AstraZeneca vaccines. A 2022 study showed 7.5 per million and a 2024 study quite recent from multiple countries showed only 7 in nearly 99 million individuals across different types of vaccine not just Kovie Shield. These are some of the innumerable studies done on the safety of these vaccines specifically the safety of Kovie Shield itself. The probability of experiencing adverse events is so extremely low because vaccines have been around since the 1800s and have saved at this point billions of lives. We have completely eliminated two diseases because of vaccines. Smallpox in humans and Rhino pest in cattle. If vaccines were going about killing one in 50,000 people or even one in 250,000 people as some people online seem to think we wouldn't really be rolling vaccines across the globe for decades. Those are risky numbers. Safety profiles of vaccines have been well established for decades already. Kovie Shield is an adenovirus vector vaccine and these are also extremely frequently used. So people have wondered whether the vaccine itself can cause an infection. So for that we need to understand how these adenovector vaccines work exactly and how these mRNA vaccines work and what the difference between them is. Adenovector vaccines add vector vaccines. You see using adenovirus as a vector or a carrier. In these vaccines, a weakened adenovirus that is incapable of causing infection or disease or dividing to multiply is used to carry protein into the body. In this case, what is being carried is the spike protein alone of the coronavirus. So the corona virus also cannot infect. The virus, the adenovirus itself might not be able to cause disease but it still knows how to latch onto our body. So it gets inside the body through the vaccine and the immune system can of course quickly kill a single variant or even a group of virus. And when it does so, it then encounters the spike protein that is being carried by the adenovirus. The immune system realizes that the spike protein is a foreign body and promptly mounts an attack. This then leads the vaccine recipe and to get a fever because the body is raising temperature and that is harmful to pathogens. The immune system then eventually trains itself to identify the spike protein and thus can stave off an actual COVID virus if it comes to infect us later. mRNA vaccines here near a special mention because they are brand new. This is the first time that we are using mRNA vaccines. mRNA is like a secret letter that gets read and then promptly burnt. Instructions in an mRNA are decoded and this is basically like a computer program that is being executed and it makes the body actually build and synthesize a fake synthetic spike protein. The same immune attack process then repeats and the mRNA in fact was long destroyed before the protein was even produced. So mRNA vaccines are safe and ad vector vaccines are also really safe. They are very common and widely used. In fact vaccines against HIV, Ebola, TB and even the flu are often ad vector vaccines and we know very well how to work with them. The work itself in India was done by the Serum Institute of India in Pune. Nasiram Institute is the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines and has been pushing out vaccines since 1966. Today they make 1.9 billion doses a year of vaccines and if a person in India gets a tetanus shot or a newborn gets an mRNA vaccine, chances are that they are Serum Institute vaccines. Serum Institute vaccines have been used by multiple countries, by WHO, UNICEF and other such agencies for people across all ages. The recent AstraZeneca news coincides with the electoral bond news cycle both having Serum Institute in common but the billionaire owner of Serum Institute, the company itself and the bonds are independent of the COVI shield vaccine safety and efficacy. Serum Institute vaccines have been safe, reliable and accessible, costing the lowest in the world which are the main things that are pertinent to our discussion today. Besides any other maker would have had to use the same formula because this vaccine is from AstraZeneca and it was developed by the Oxford University. All of this that we talked about until now is the necessary information to provide context with which we have to understand the recent AstraZeneca acceptance of rare cases and the lawsuit. India has a strong vaccine legacy. We do not have a history of an organized anti-vaxxer movement that has taken hold of America. Our vaccine logistics are extremely impressive even for an Indian citizen. Infrastructure of course ought to be to this standard across the board but that's a different discussion. We have studied data enough data to be able to say that the COVI shield vaccine is safe and reliable for its purpose. First, these vaccines reduce debts. That is the primary purpose of vaccines. Then they reduce serious disease, another benefit of vaccines. Then they prevent disease altogether another advantage and lastly they prevent transmission from one vaccinated person to any other person. If the vaccine does the first which is preventing death it is successful. This isn't to say that the vaccine is 100 percent free from side effects. Nothing is 100 percent. There are indeed notable ones that the company has admitted to such as BITT and also others like N. Sephelitis and Myelitis that have been detected and have been known a month into the rollout of the vaccines globally. The numbers are very very low but nothing is new. There is no information in the lawsuit or in AstraZeneca statement that we did not know already. The side effects information is included in the vaccine packaging itself and many countries have indeed adjusted their vaccine rollout policies based on adverse effects. Some countries in the European Union had temporarily halted the AstraZeneca vaccine briefly but then immediately resumed when reports clearly began to show within a few days that these cases of BITT are extremely rare. Nothing is completely effective for all people. There is no 100 percent efficacy for 100 percent of the people who receive a therapeutic or a vaccine. Medicines are biochemicals that interact with our body and our heterogeneous population where we are all different from each other will inevitably carry people with one or two of the millions of genetic mutation that could cause a person to react adversely to a therapeutic or a vaccine. Over time this becomes known. It's risk is evaluated depending on how common these reactions are and vaccines are modified if necessary and even then vaccines would not be 100 percent safe for 100 percent of the people who take them and this is true for all vaccines. Even today we take the polio vaccine. Polio is almost entirely eliminated except in difficult access terrains in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hindukush. These are occupied by the mountains regional tribes almost cut off from the rest of the world. OPPORIAL polio vaccine has a known and well established side effect since it is a weakened form of the polio virus. In rare cases it can actually cause the very disease that it is trying to prevent and indeed in 2021 a whole total of six polio cases were documented globally while 10 generations of not just the Indians of continent but the entire world has received the vaccinations. So there's that lightning number again. Forget vaccines. In rare cases many users online have also pointed out that even parasitamol has extremely serious side effects. In some people it can lead to bloody stools, back spasms, extremities, turning blue, becoming dizzy or fainting and not waking up and more. Once again even with parasitamol such cases will occur within the first six weeks or 42 days of ingesting the medicine or taking a vaccine. The vaccine does not cause permanent change in our bodies. In medicine a permanent change would indicate a genetic change and these vaccines and medicines are incapable of modifying our DNA. So symptoms don't present themselves months later. The paranoia induced by the recent news and its various interpretation has led to a lot of confusion like this but has also led to some interesting questions. What about cardiac events? Cardiac events can be triggered by the ITT and that carries even less probability but COVID which has moved through our population silently and invisibly is known to trigger serious cardiovascular issues and diabetes in otherwise completely health, fit and sporty people. Many of us who have never tested positive for COVID would have still caught an asymptomatic infection. I myself have not had a sense of smell for nearly two years now but I constantly tested whenever I felt sick and I never tested positive for COVID. I clearly got it at some point because lack of smell is a symptom of long COVID but not the vaccine. Likewise many others would have also gotten COVID without knowing and subsequently infections for COVID incidentally get worse unlike other diseases that is an actual mystery but back to vaccines. Why does it take so long to approve a vaccine in general and how come COVID vaccines got rolled out so quick? Well vaccines need a long trials to see the effects of vaccines over time. However in an emergency situation like a pandemic, lack of time can be compensated numerically by increasing the number of people that are being tested and that is what happened with the COVID vaccines. Besides these vaccines did not come out unnaturally quick. COVID vaccine was asked to be launched in one and a half months in time for India's independence day. That would have been unnaturally quick and in fact impossible. So these are all not concerns to suddenly take up at this point. Besides there is absolutely nothing new in the recent development. Why are we agitating over something we knew more than three years ago? There are things that we still do not know and those things we deserve answers to. How many cases were there in India and how many adverse events were reported in India? Oops, we don't know. Here we have hit the mate of the matter. The right question to be asked is where is the adverse event reporting in India? US has a system called vaccine adverse event reporting system or VAERS and the Indian version of that is adverse effects following immunization. AEFI system. This exists for a reason and data here is required to make our vaccines as perfect as we can and reduce the medically rare risk that exists today. However, there is no available website or dashboard where adverse events from India are available or can be recorded. When someone experiences an adverse event, not many people know that the first thing to be done is to contact the Ministry of Health. People don't know how to report these events. It's too late for the COVID vaccine now. But the lack of national level data like this reduces transparency and responsibility and those are the more valid things that need to be questioned. There are two subjects in the overlapping political and scientific discourse that are sacrosand and that need a lot of context and knowledge to be touched upon. Vaccines and climate change. Behind every headline and update are thousands and thousands of scientists who have crunched up numbers built upon the work of thousands more. Discussing these topics and raising questions about them requires a deeper knowledge in context for the safety of our own citizens and future generations. All of this is not to say that vaccine rollouts in India were smooth and without fault. Scientists were asked to get out of vaccine in one and a half months. How? As cases spread, there were election rallies being held. How come? Coronal makers are apologizing now. What's up with that? Efficacy of co-vaccine. Where's the data? Adverse reporting is non-existence. Why? All valid questions. But they are all firmly on one side of the line of vaccine safety. This side has questions that are already answered. Vaccines are good even when companies are sued. Thank you for tuning in to watch a video from the print.

Germany temporarily halts AstraZeneca vaccinations | Coronavirus latest,DW News,2021-03-15,jJX87rjZPzc,"We begin with breaking developments. Germany joins is the latest to join a growing number of countries to suspend the rollout of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine over safety fears. Bulgaria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Iceland have stopped giving the shots, following reports of an increased risk of blood clots. But AstraZeneca and the World Health Organization insist there's no risk. The move comes after a leading German lawmaker called on the authorities to issue clear guidance on whether the vaccine is, quote, good or bad. All right, let's get you more now. I'm joined by Esther Giosz. Moshos, he is a virologist and associate professor at the Northumbria University in the UK. A very good day, sir. Now, I'd like to get your reaction to these latest developments. AstraZeneca, as you know, insisting there's just simply no evidence that its vaccine causes increased risk of blood clots. Yet a number of countries, so most will be Norden European countries, have suspended the use of the vaccine. Yeah, so I think it must say, first of all, that it's extremely important when situations like these arise to take them very seriously and have a look at the data very carefully before jumping to conclusions. We've come into this pandemic through a decade of people listening to conspiracy theories around the risks of vaccines with regards to other diseases. So any kind of wrong message, it's actually going to be very impactful, especially in an effort to try and push back against this pandemic. So it's really, really important that we give clear, concise and carefully photab messages. So in that respect, I fully support the decision of any longmaker to stop, have a look and take it to consideration the data. Now, on that data, what we know is that 17 million people have received this vaccine and 37 people have developed these blood clots. That corresponds to 0.002 percent of actually anybody that has been vaccinated getting a blood clot. And you would probably agree with me that the risk of getting a blood clot is actually 100 times, if not more, less than the risk of actually dying from coronavirus if you get it to get it. Therefore, to basically be afraid of something that may happen because of the vaccine in order to protect yourself from something else that can be much more harmful to you, that alone should be decided to people whether or not they should take the vaccine. But of course, I think the question is, sorry sir, for interruption because we have very limited time together and I'd like to get as many answers from you as possible. You know, obviously, yes, the chance is very slim that one will get a blood clot. But if you happen to be that one person, have that bad luck, that is of course not ideal. In terms of AstraZeneca, it's been bogged by trust issues, not so much in its vaccine, but in terms of the deal that kind of didn't went wayward with the EU. You know, what can AstraZeneca do at this stage to restore confidence in its product? Look, I don't work for the Public Relations Department of AstraZeneca. I'm here as a scientist to express my opinion, my learned opinion about the risk that's presented by this vaccine. And I'm going to put it this way. If somebody came to me through the door right now, I said to me, here's the vaccine, will you take it? I would say, yes please, because I'm on the queue to come in to get the vaccine at the end of April and that's too far away as far as I'm concerned. I would take it straight away. I would even give it to my four-year-old child, even though this has not been tested on children. This is how confident I feel personally about the risk presented by these so-called blood clots. Blood clots happen in the population randomly. There's a specific number out there that you can look up, which with regards to the frequency of blood clots in the general population. People that have received the vaccine seem to be twice less likely to get the blood clots overall. So from that perspective, there is no risk. We really need to make that abundantly clear. You're joining us, sir, from the UK, where, as I understand, AstraZeneca is widely used. Share with us some of the experience that the UK has had with this particular inoculation. What can I say? Obviously, many people would have to prefer to receive one of the vaccines that have a generally slightly higher percentage of efficacy. But it still is a very efficacious vaccine. We have other vaccines that have been approved any useful decades that are nowhere near as efficacious as this vaccine. And as a result of that, there should be no concern and no hesitancy about receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. The only individuals that should be a bit more careful are the people with very strong allergies. And this is just something general for all medications. I'm sure last time you went to the doctors and they gave you a prescription, they asked you, are you allergic to anything? So if you are allergic to something, you need to tell the doctor before you get any vaccine, not just this vaccine or the mRNA vaccines. It's actually important that we think about the common good here and how we can work as individuals to support society and the economy in general. All right, Esther Yosemoreshos, he biologist and associate professor at Northumbria University in the UK and molecular biologist. Thank you for sharing your expertise with us. Do you mind welcome? All right, let's get some other developments now on the pandemic. The developers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, say companies in Germany, France, Italy and Spain have agreed to help produce the jab. It hasn't officially been approved in the EU yet, though. Meanwhile, I see you doctors here in Germany are urging an immediate return to a partial lockdown because of COVID-19 mutations. Germany has seen a rise in infections since gradually easing measures late last month. And half of Italy's regions have gone into a strict lockdown. It's because of a new spike in coronavirus infections. Authorities say hospital admissions are beyond manageable."
"Blood Clots, FDA Approval, and the AstraZeneca Covid Vaccine",Healthcare Triage,2021-04-21,h_PzK3ioikk,"News from the AstraZeneca vaccine has taken us on a wild ride the past few months. From incomplete data to reports of blood clots, people are wondering what's going on and whether they can trust this vaccine or not. If you're one of those people, we're here to break down what we know so far and to couch it all in the appropriate context. That's the topic of this week's self-care triage. Starting to studies, the AstraZeneca vaccine is 100 percent effective against severe COVID-19 and 76 percent effective against symptomatic disease. As you may know, the company initially released trial results in March, shortly after which concerns were raised that the numbers they reported were based on outdated information. These concerns were raised by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of the NIH, who helped conduct a trial. They spoke up after hearing from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board that was auditing the trial, which said updated information suggested the vaccine's efficacy looked more likely to be between 69 and 75 percent effective. This was serious, but the potentially outdated numbers on efficacy against symptomatic disease was 79 percent, sliding just 3 percent when updated. The efficacy against severe disease did not change, though it's worth mentioning that that number is based on just eight cases of severe COVID-19 observed in the placebo group. In the data news report, those initial numbers were based on 141 COVID-19 cases in the study, which included 32,000 patients, and the updated numbers were based on 190 COVID-19 cases. We're not saying it's great that this mix-up happened in the first place. We're just happy to see that the final number didn't drastically drop, because increasing the supply of effective vaccines is a welcome development in our book. We also hope to stress that instead of the situation making people wary of the vaccine, get its service and example of the safeguards in place to ensure vaccine safety. This is a good example of one of the safeguards working. AstraZeneca plans to file for an emergency use authorization in the United States, and according to stat news, the FDA plans to do its own analysis of the trial data when making their decision. And what about those bloodglots? The vaccine has already been in use in other countries, and news broken marks that several European countries were temporarily suspending its use based on blood clot concerns. On April 7, the European Medicines Agency Safety Committee reported that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as a very rare side effect to the vaccine. These clots were found to occur in blood vessels in the brain and abdomen and in arteries, and sometimes occurred alongside bleeding. The recommendation to list them as a very rare side effect was based on an in-depth review of 86 cases, 18 of which were fatal. We understand how scary that sounds at face value, and we do not minimize the tragedy of those 18 cases. It is our responsibility, however, to emphasize how very rare this side effect is. Please keep in mind that these cases came from reporting systems where, according to the report from the European Medicines Agency, around 25 million people received the vaccine. We also don't want to minimize the tragedy of lives lost to COVID-19, and it is in that context that we have to save the benefits of this vaccine heavily outweigh the risks. According to another stat news article, current estimates report this side effect occurring as high as one per every 100,000 vaccinations, and as low as one per every 250,000 vaccinations. It is critical to understand those estimates in relation to the risk of blood clots in other situations, to help you do that, consider the following. OBS individuals from high-income countries experience strokes in an estimated rate of 6.1 per 100,000. In case you need context, remember that most strokes are the consequence of a blood clot blocking or narrowing an artery leading to the brain. The risk of stroke for women who take low estrogen oral birth control is estimated to be about 4.1 per 100,000. For pregnant women, this estimate appears to land somewhere between 3.8 and 18 per 100,000. And most relevant to the current situation. The odds of having a stroke if you contract COVID-19 and require hospitalization are estimated to be about 1,400 per 100,000. We should note that all of these estimates vary based on many factors, including the type of stroke, but putting the risk in context remains relevant. So keeping that in mind, let's summarize the risks we just mentioned. Using current estimates, the risk of stroke when getting any AstraZeneca vaccine is lower than the risk of stroke for obese individuals from high-income countries, lower than the risk of stroke for women who are taking birth control or who are pregnant and is significantly lower than the risk of stroke for individuals who contract in a hospitalized with COVID-19. Some people have asked why they should take it if there's any risk at all. And we say for the same reason you may choose to do other things that carry risks, because there are outcomes you deem beneficial that outweigh the risks you face by doing it. In the case of the vaccine, the beneficial outcome is to protect yourself against COVID-19, including potential hospitalization and blood clots. Or if you feel your risk for that is too low, another beneficial outcome is protecting those around you who aren't so lucky to be at a risk level that they feel is negligible. This has too rarely been communicated in the media firestorm surrounding this issue. Undermining confidence in this vaccine is a major problem, particularly because this one is easier to manufacture and distribute and is more affordable than some of the other vaccines. Meaning it could be particularly useful in ensuring high vaccination rates all over the world. However, people need to feel confident taking it, and so far public confidence has taken some major hits thanks to current messaging. We hope this video can help to counteract that.

Blood clots after vaccination | Johnson & Johnson AstraZeneca | What you need to know,Medicine with Dr. Moran,2021-04-27,BlzIJmzxcHQ,"Hello, welcome to Medicine with Dr. Maureen. I'm Dr. Keith Maureen. This week a lot of information has come out from the approximate 10-day pause in the Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. The FDA and CDC have now resumed vaccinations with this product. I wanted to review this information. Some of the slides that I will put up are directly from the CDC and I have a link below in the description to the full slide set presentation if you wish to look at that. As this vaccine was being rolled out in the USA, reports of blood clots were noted just like what has been seen for the AstraZeneca vaccine. This was not seen in any patient in the Phase 3 Johnson and Johnson trial, but obviously we're getting into much larger numbers of people receiving the vaccine compared to what we saw in the Phase 3 trial. About 8 million people in the US have received the vaccination now. It is the one-shot vaccine. Now what's being described in very small numbers of vaccinated people is a syndrome of blood clots which we call thrombosis and it's associated with a low-play account which medically we call thrombocytopenia. They're calling this thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome. There are other terms to describe it that you may have heard of such as vaccine-induced immune thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Here is some background information on thrombosis. Thrombosis can occur in veins as well as arteries and it can cause heart attacks, strokes, and other problems. There are additional risk factors for blood clots and there are hostess symptoms that people can get depending upon which artery or vein is blocked. We diagnose blood clots mainly through imaging tests where we can see the blood clot on either ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Blood tests can often tell the extent of the damage. This slide explains what low-playlets mean. The playlists of the blood cells in our circulation which stop bleeding by clumping together and form a plug in a blood vessel injury. For example when you cut yourself and you're bleeding the platelet plug is what occurs first. Now dangerously low-playlets counts can lead to serious spontaneous internal bleeding. In Europe as well as other countries they have found a link with the AstraZeneca vaccine to this particular syndrome. This slide is a release from the European Medicines Agency acknowledging this fact. They found 62 cases of blood clots in the veins of the brain and 24 cases of blood clots in the veins draining the intestines. 18 of these cases unfortunately were fatal. About 25 million people had received the vaccine which gives an overall risk of 1 in 300,000. Obviously this is a rare condition and as I've highlighted at the bottom of this slide the overall benefits of the vaccine and preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects. It is though something for the individual person to consider if they're going to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. As far as the Johnson and Johnson vaccine goes there were reports of blood clots involving the veins which drain the brain and a decision was made to put the vaccine on hold April 14th to get more information. This slide shows how blood is actually drained from your brain through veins which we call sinuses. The blood ultimately drains into both the left and right internal jugular veins which then drain back into the heart. Blood clots in these veins of the brain are term cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. These types of blood clots are quite rare but they're quite significant and they can cause significant symptoms and illness and sometimes even death. They're very uncommon I can tell you I've only seen two cases in my 30-year career as a consultant in internal medicine. These types of blood clots are not associated with low platelets usually. What we're seeing now though with Johnson and Johnson vaccination are not only blood clots in the cerebral veins but the presence of low platelet counts as well. What was being found April 14th when the vaccine was put on pause is summarized on this slide from the CDC. At that time they noted six reports of women in the 18 to 48 years of age all with low platelets. At the time this was six cases out of 6.8 million vaccinations. The rates of these venous blood clots in the brain appear to be about threefold greater than what you might expect as background rates in the general population. I make note that no reported cases of this clotting had been seen in 182 million vaccinations with Moderna or Pfizer. Now the clinical features were similar to the features observed with the AstraZeneca vaccinations in Europe that I just talked about. The thing in common of course is that both vaccines use an incompetent adenoviral vector to deliver vaccine into the cells whereas the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are different. They have a lipid layer or if you like a coating of fat around their vaccine which allows the vaccine to be delivered directly into cells. I will review how the vaccines work in this particular video. Subsequently additional cases were noted after the Johnson and Johnson pause and this slides details them. They're predominantly noted in the female population with the vast majority in the 18 to 49 years of age range. This slide shows the age groups and rates. This next slide gives you a better idea of the ages. The patients had an average age of 37 and typically developed a syndrome six to 15 days after the vaccination. 12 cases were of clots inside the brain with three cases having blood clots not within the brain but in different blood vessels. Some of the 12 cases with clots inside the brain also had blood clots elsewhere. Now how do you know if you have a blood clot? Well this slide shows the typical symptoms as well as medical signs that someone might have this if they have a clot. A lot of the symptoms as you can see are quite non-specific such as a headache, chills, fever, nausea, fatigue, vomiting and abdominal pain. Later on there can be more specific symptoms such as neck discomfort or stiffness, weakness on one side of the body, trouble with speech, difficulty with vision or double vision, seizures and loss of consciousness can also occur. I wanted to show the locations of blood clots in these 15 people because they may not just be in the veins of the brain. As I mentioned three cases were not in that location but were in other veins or arteries of the body. Many people had blood clots in more than one location and in fact. 11 of the 15 people had blood clots outside of the brain. This means as physicians we need to consider other locations for these clots. This slide shows treatments as well as outcomes. Of the 15 patients three unfortunately died, seven or still hospitalized at this time with four in the ICU and five were discharged from the hospital. I will go into diagnosis and treatment of this condition in another video. Now in total approximately 8 million J&J vaccinations were given and we see 15 events where their blood clots associated with low platelets which gives an overall risk of one in 500,000 or one and a half a million. We now understand more about this condition and its frequency. In a nutshell both the AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson vaccines do induce an immune response which causes an antibody to be produced against platelets ultimately leading to platelets to coming together and clump to cause blood clots and because they're all clumping they get consumed and you have less platelets in the rest of your body giving you a low platelet count. Now people are using different words to describe the syndrome. As I presented the C-DC is using the term thrombotic thrombocytopaedic syndrome but you'll hear other terms such as vaccine-induced immune, pro thrombotic thrombocytopaedia to describe what's happening. It is important for doctors to consider blood clots and patients who present after vaccination and carry out the appropriate diagnostic tests and treatment and of course report these cases. There will continue to be safety surveillance and research on this condition as we go forward. Ultimately it's a rare condition with the current rate estimated of one in 500,000 with respect to the J&J vaccine. The frequency of course may change slightly with time but it will still be rare. It is on the order of someone getting struck by lightning and other infrequent risks. Risks of course using over the counter medications like aspirin, ibuprofen, even a cedar minifin are going to be higher than this. Now it's obviously not rare if you happen to be the person who gets it. It's something the people will want to consider when they're getting their vaccinations. Putting an in-perspective this is a tiny risk in comparison to the benefit of the vaccination in people at risk of an adverse effect from COVID-19. Remember the blood clots are quite common in COVID-19 illness with about 15 percent of people in the hospital getting a blood clot. We don't know the exact percentage of people who have COVID-19 who are not hospitalized who get blood clots but for sure it's almost certainly to be much higher than one in 500,000. I'm just trying to put things in perspective for you. Despite this this remains a good vaccine. I have more information on the vaccine itself in this video. In that video I review the results of the phase 3 trial and the effectiveness of the vaccine. Overall I'm pleased to see resumption of vaccinations as the approximate 10-day pause meant that many people did not get vaccinated which would have led to more COVID-19 infections that would not have happened if they had not had a pause. The pause in this risk unfortunately is going to make people think twice of a receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It of course is a personal decision which I know some of you are interested in and so I've tried to present the best information we have so that people can make an informed decision and choose for themselves. Thanks for joining me today on medicine with Dr. Morn. I'm Dr. Keith Morn. Thanks for watching my channel. Remember get healthy and stay healthy."
AstraZeneca Withdraws Covishield Vaccine After Admitting Rare Side Effects | Firstpost America,Firstpost,2024-05-08,13HtRQ292Cs,"Though COVID no longer dominates the headlines, vaccine maker AstraZeneca certainly does. The company is withdrawing its vaccine from the markets. The pharmaceutical giant claims it's because of a decline in demand. But notably, this decision comes weeks after AstraZeneca admitted that the COVID-Shield vaccine can cause blood clots. In the UK alone, the firm is facing more than 50 lawsuits over these claims. Our final report takes you inside the drug maker's decision to pull the vaccine from the market. In the whirlwind of the pandemic era, COVID-19 vaccines emerged as beacons of hope. Hundreds of people waited eagerly for their shot at protection. During that time, nothing seemed more important than a COVID-19 vaccine. Among the heroes were COVID-Shield, COVID-19, Novavax and Sputnik V. But now the spotlight dims. Pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca has begun the worldwide withdrawal of its COVID-Shield vaccine. The makers feel that the vaccine which once promised to give immunity against COVID-19 is no longer needed. The decision stems from a surplus of newer vaccines available in the market. AstraZeneca says the newer vaccines are tailored to combat the evolving virus variants, which makes their COVID-Shield vaccines obsolete. The pharmaceutical giant says this has led to a decline in demand, which is why they no longer want to manufacture it. They now want to conclude their era of pandemic response efforts. But there's another side to AstraZeneca's miracle vaccine. The pharmaceutical giant faces daunting legal battles. A lawsuit totaling over $100 million in the UK looms over AstraZeneca. The allegations link their COVID-Jab to the deaths of 80 individuals and countless severe injuries. The first legal case came last year by a man who was left with a permanent brain injury. The number of cases have now reportedly risen to 51. AstraZeneca contests the accusations. But the company also accepted that in very rare cases, COVID-Shield can cause TTS. TTS stands for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. It causes blood clots and a low blood platelet count. The medical community had reportedly accepted the possibility of blood clots in 2021. Several scientists studied the potential serious side effects of COVID-Shield. Experts recommended an alternative job for people under the age of 40. They said that the risk of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweighed the harm posed by COVID-19. Despite claims of saving over 6.5 million lives during the pandemic and distributing over 3 billion doses worldwide, AstraZeneca now finds itself on shaky ground. As the curtain falls on this chapter, questions linger over the legacy of AstraZeneca's vaccine. Once hailed as a global lifeline against the pandemic, was COVID-Shield rolled out too fast and were people made the test subjects. Or did the vaccine work wonders for billions making the fresh cases of death and injury just an anomaly? First post reports from the world's second largest continent. Hello, I'm Alison McGrange, a very warm welcome from Durban, South Africa. We get you the news and the newsmakers from Africa. South Africa goes to the polls on the 29th of May. I will track the election and bring you ground reports. Is it the end of the road for the African National Congress and will form a President Jacob Sumer stage a dramatic comeback? From elections to climate change, to innovations and opportunities. As the world's attention shifts, we report from Africa the heart of the global South. Join me every weekday live on First Post. you"
"Global cancer concerns","Dr. John Campbell","2024-03-28","mxBz-jHDy_w","We're actually working in Australia with Professor Robert Clancy and more to come on that over the next few days, hopefully, but interesting developments. Now, I've been talking to Professor Angus Dalgleish. With Professor Clancy, Professor Dalgleish has been one of the clearer-thinking minds on this pandemic, and I was just talking to Angus Dalgleish recently on the phone, and we've agreed to do an interview on this topic when I get home. There's something I want to bring to your attention, and it's an article, again fully referenced, by Angus Dalgleish, a professor of oncology, one of the most senior physicians in the country. He's written this article, ""mRNA Vaccines Must Be Banned Once and For All,"" in the opinion of Professor Dalgleish. Now, let's see what his rationale for this is and see if it makes sense. He says this, and we reported on this in some detail at the time and recorded a video with Professor Dalgleish on this at the end of last year. I reported seeing melanoma patients, which is skin cancer, but it spreads all over the body. Melanoma can kill you really quickly. I've seen patients die of melanoma in months, not years, but Professor Dalgleish has been keeping his patients alive for 5 years, 10 years, 15, 20 years. This is, I believe, quite a remarkable success in oncology. At the end of last year, Professor Dalgleish said he was seeing more melanoma reactivation, seeing melanoma patients who have been stable for years relapse after their first booster, that's the third injection, and he also says in this article, which I'm going to give you the reference for, ""The number of my patients affected has been rising ever since."" So, stable melanoma patients' cancers reactivated after the booster. Now, if Professor Dalgleish says this, it should be taken seriously, and all we need to say there's no problem here is for the regulatory authorities to stand up and say, ""Professor Dalgleish is wrong. There is no reactivation of melanoma after booster doses of the vaccine."" Clear the decks, then we know where we stand. So far, I haven't heard them say that. Other oncologists have contacted me from all around the world, including Australia and the United States. Being one of the leading oncologists in the world, Professor Dalgleish has international networks and has been contacted by colleagues from Australia and the United States, and after booster doses, these colleagues are reporting more lymphomas. Lymphoma is a potentially deadly cancer of the lymphatic system. You've probably heard of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. More lymphomas being reported to Professor Dalgleish, more leukemias being reported to Professor Dalgleish, a group of cancers that affect the blood, more kidney cancers are being reported as well. Professor Dalgleish says this, ""My colorectal cancer colleagues are reporting an epidemic of explosive cancers."" Explosive cancers don't sound good. Those presenting with multiple metastases and elsewhere. What very often happens is a cancer will begin in the colon and then it spreads to the liver. Ideally, we would pick it up when it's still just in the colon and be able to resect it, get rid of it, treat it hopefully just with endoscopy, but if it's already spread to the liver, the prognosis is very gloomy indeed. If Professor Dalgleish is saying this, again, all it needs is the regulatory authority to stand up and say, ""You know what, we've looked at this. There is no increase in lymphoma. There is no increase in leukemia. There is no increase in kidney cancer. There is no increase in colorectal cancer, and if there is, it's certainly not attributable to COVID vaccines."" Just stand up, say that, be clear. It's not me saying this. Of course, they could reasonably ignore me, but this is not me saying this. This is one of the world's leading oncologists saying this, and it's a question that should be answered. If there's no problem here, say there's no problem, clear it up. We'll all go home, and we'll start thinking about infectious diseases and other problems around the world, of which there are many. So, there we are, more reactivations of melanoma, potential lymphomas, leukemia, kidney cancer, colorectal cancers often presenting at a late stage. Please, regulatory authorities, dismiss this, say it's rubbish, and reduce my anxiety levels. Now, Professor Dalgleish has got a good track record. He knew from the beginning that SARS-CoV-2 contained inserts indicating potential laboratory manipulation. He said right from the start the vaccine didn't stay at the site of injection. He said right from the start there was batch-to-batch variability, and these alarms were brushed off by regulators. Of course, now we know that many of them have been substantiated by thorough scientific evidence. He also talked about DNA contamination. Why are so many cancers occurring now? Professor Dalgleish does address this. T-cell suppression was his first likely explanation. The T-cells, the immune lymphocytes, recognize cancer and kill it at an early stage. Is that the problem? But now he says this, ""However, we must also now consider DNA plasmid SV40, simian virus 40, integration in promoting cancer development."" What we need now is for the regulatory authorities to stand up and say, ""You know what, there is no DNA contamination in the vaccines."" Well, they're not going to say that because, well, we know there is, the ones that are made from E. coli preparations at least, which is all of them, I think, being sold at the moment. So, stand up and say, ""You know what, there's no simian virus here. SV40, this promoter of cancer, is simply not there. You're worrying about nothing."" Then I'll think, ""Phew, thank goodness for that. Sorry, I thought we might have had a problem there."" That's all they have to say. MHRA, FDA, just stand up and say that, please, and then we can forget about this. So, there we go. Reports that mRNA spike protein binds to p53 and other cancer suppressor genes is another possibility. Now, what we have here are genes which suppress cancer. They reduce the mitotic rate, the cell division rate. They're called cancer suppressor genes or onco-suppressor genes. There's also oncogenes, which can promote cancers, which increase cell division. But Professor Dalgleish here is concerned that the mRNA spike protein binds to cancer suppressor genes and stops them from working properly. That's his fear. Now, again, regulators just say, ""No, you know what, mRNA vaccine spike protein doesn't bind to p53 or other cancer suppressor genes. Forget about it. There's no problem here."" But this is a question that should be answered. Professor Dalgleish says this, ""To advise booster doses, as is currently the case, is no more and no less than medical incompetence,"" depending on the country you're in. Of course, no ifs, no buts, any longer. The mRNA vaccines must be halted and banned now unless the regulatory authorities want to say, ""Look, there's no problem here. Professor Dalgleish is wrong."" Then we'll all go home and forget about it, having been reassured. Until that point, I am concerned."" On the comments, we're getting so many cancers, especially in younger people. I'm not going to name individuals, but we all know that this is in the news at the moment. Now, just before we finish, Eurostat, the European statistics agency, says circulatory diseases and cancers accounted for 54% of all European Union deaths in 2021. Of course, people sadly die, so in 2021, there were 5.3 million deaths in the European Union. Circulatory diseases accounted for 1.7 million, cancer 1.4 million. They were the two most common. Of course, we know that circulatory diseases have been increasing quite dramatically, at least in England, as of late. Heart failure especially is rapidly increasing or very high in incidence. Then, other things like respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal diseases are all listed, of course. Now, Eurostat in 2022 reported a lot of excess deaths. In April, it was 12% more than normal. In May, it was 7% more than normal. In June, it was 7% more than normal. In July, it was 16% more than normal. We know this continued into 2023. Now, in 2024, we've actually got the data for January. Eurostat data overall for the European Union showed it was 3.6% more deaths than we would expect above baseline, but it does say this: In January 2024, the highest excess mortality rates were in the Netherlands, 15.3% in January 2024; Denmark, 11.5% in January 2024; and Germany, 9.9% in January 2024. It does say in January 2024, excess mortality continued to vary. Now, which countries do you think had lower values? Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Croatia, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Poland, Latvia, and Czechia had no excess deaths. What could be a link here? There's very high excess deaths in these westernized countries, and in the more eastern countries, lower excess deaths. We have the Bradford Hill criteria to adjudicate on that, and we've talked about that in the past. So, I am concerned. Netherlands, excess deaths January 2024, this is continuing, 15.3%; Denmark, 11.5%; Germany, 9.9%. It's continuing. This is a concern. We need to work out what is causing this. Good to see that in Australia, the Senate is going to investigate the causes of excess deaths. They're making no assumptions. They're just going to investigate the cause of excess deaths. This needs to happen in all countries around the world, in my view, and Professor Dalgleish's concerns need to be squashed by the regulators, and we await their response for now."
Coronavirus: What makes Oxford-AstraZeneca’s vaccine different from others approved,Global News,2020-12-30,TjgGs8DXuzE,"Meanwhile, health Canada is still reviewing another one, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, and there's no timeline for completion, but today, the UK became the first country to approve it. The vaccine is low cost, and it's easier to store than the others. The UK is reporting nearly 1,000 new deaths, the most since April, and more than 50,000 new infections. The government is now extending its toughest restrictions to about three-quarters of England's population. Redmond Shannon reports. The approval of this British-made vaccine is getting a cautious welcome from weary Londoners stuck in an indefinite lockdown. Yeah, I think the vaccines probably are the answer, but I suspect we all imagine they're going to be a very quick panacea that are going to turn things down quickly, but I think we're really in it for the long haul. I think that's certainly take it. I mean, it can't get any worse. Experts, however, are choosing to play up the positives, too. To have two vaccines on board now both approves, both really good and a massive input of extra doses really becomes a game changer. The UK is the first nation to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine. People are already getting the Pfizer-BioNTech shot across much of the West and parts of the Middle East and Latin America. Moderna's is currently only approved in North America, and other Chinese and Russian vaccines are in use across a growing number of nations. The timing of this vaccine approval could not have come soon enough for frontline workers here in the UK, hospitals and emergency services are currently dealing with a record number of new daily cases, particularly here in the capital and in surrounding areas. That's why scientists are recommending that one dose should be given to as many people as possible before the rounds of second doses begin. This will allow the greatest number of eligible people to receive vaccine in the shortest time possible, and that will protect the greatest number of lives. We are shifting heaven and earth to roll them out as fast as we can. Although cheaper and easier to store, the AstraZeneca vaccine is a little less effective than the two approved in Canada, but experts say it's still more effective than the seasonal flu shot. Ottawa has up to 20 million doses on order. Redmond Shannon Double News, London."
COVID-19: Ireland suspends AstraZeneca vaccine,Sky News,2021-03-14,Rjx27XSBTEE,"When the first AstraZeneca doses arrived in Ireland last month, the country's health minister tweeted this video, hailing it as a big day. Today, his department suddenly pulled the vaccine. In a surprise statement this morning, the Irish Department of Health here in Dublin announced the suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine after reports from Norway of a small number of adults who had received the dose there, developing blood clot issues. Although the Irish authority stressed that no conclusive link has yet been established, for now at least, the AstraZeneca vaccine has been withdrawn here in Ireland. In a statement, AstraZeneca said that an analysis of our safety data from more than 17 million doses of vaccine administered has shown no evidence of an increased risk. Some experts averaged the public not to read too much into the suspension. I think we have to bear in mind in science that correlation isn't causation. We're basing this on reports from Scandinavia. We have to look at, again, the British data, where millions of doses have been given, and we haven't seen an elevation in these events. But it's still better to be cautious, and the decision today has been made over an even overabundance of caution. Ireland isn't the first country to take action. Denmark, Norway and Iceland have also temporarily halted AstraZeneca vaccinations to investigate the reports. Austria banned doses from a particular batch, after a person was hospitalised with pulmonary embolism after being vaccinated, Italy, Estonia and other countries then followed suit. AstraZeneca vaccine has had some quite poor press in the last few months. Most of it, I think, has been unjustified, and it will make it more difficult for people to accept the vaccine. It will put people off, and if it does that, as it almost certainly will, it will lead to more people getting ill, more people getting severely ill, and more people dying. Irish authorities are awaiting further information from the European Medicines Agency, and are hopeful the AstraZeneca suspension will only last for a week. But that's a week when tens of thousands of Irish people had hoped to receive their first dose. Stephen Murphy's Sky News in Dublin."
AstraZeneca Admits Their COVID Vaccine Can Cause Clotting,Drbeen Medical Lectures,2024-05-02,-E1i7F37cJo,"All this Dr. Mobine Sayyat from DrBean.com welcome to one more show. So the topic today is interesting as does Enica for the first time in two or three years of legal battles about the COVID vaccine and clotting has admitted in the legal submissions to court that their vaccine, COVID vaccine can cause clotting or these rare side effects. Why is this news? There are a couple of things in here that are news number one. This is the very first time ever in a legal document they have admitted that this can happen before that they had simply been saying that we are not aware of any such thing. Second thing is that within that legal document they still said the cause is unknown while I'll show you today. I'll had I had to do some journalistic digging and I'll show you that they were actually aware of the mechanism of clotting in December of 2021. And here in February 2024 they are still submitting to the court that the cause is unknown. So let's look at this together. So first here are the references this DrBean.com. If you would like to have access to more lectures go to DrBean.com and you can get access to amazing medical lectures. This is the write up on telegraph.co.uk. AstraZeneca admits its COVID vaccine can cause rare side effects and court documents for the first time. Then this is December 2nd 2021 where AstraZeneca actually knew the mechanism of the thrombosis and then some more supporting documents all of these are present, the links are present in the description. So with this let's start with my drawings. So first of all the telegraph says AstraZeneca is the second largest publicly listed company in the UK with a market capitalization of more than 170 billion pounds. Its chief executive Sir Pascal Suryard is the highest paid boss among FDSC 100 companies with earnings close to 19 million pounds yearly. Now the AstraZeneca admits its COVID vaccine can cause rare side effects and court documents for the first time pharmaceutical giant being sued in class action over claims its vaccine caused death and serious injuries in dozens of cases. So AstraZeneca has admitted for the first time in court document that its COVID vaccine can cause rare side effects in an apparent about turn that could pave the way for a multi million pound legal payout. So I think all the legal cases that are going against the AstraZeneca at this time it's about 100 million pounds that are being asked. So check this out in one of the cases where there was a person there's a person I believe Jamie Scott who has sued AstraZeneca because he's almost become disabled after the vaccination. So AstraZeneca wrote this to in a letter to the lawyer of Mr. Scott. So AstraZeneca wrote in a letter of response sent in May 2023. AstraZeneca told lawyers from Mr. Scott that we do not accept that TTS so thrombosis with thrombosidopenia syndrome is caused by the vaccine at a generic level. So they were pushing back even in 2023 may that he we do not know this and I'll show you that they knew it in December of 2021. But in the legal document submitted to the high court in February of 2024, AstraZeneca said it is admitted that the AstraZeneca vaccine can in very rare cases cause TTS thrombosis with thrombosidopenia syndrome. The causal mechanism is not known. This is actually something that is really interesting that they are still saying the causal mechanism not known. Okay. So let's actually look at the causal mechanism that has been researched with the AstraZeneca scientists present in that research. So I'll show you the references later on, but here is the mechanism. One this vaccine is given. Remember the AstraZeneca vaccine Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine and the Johnson and Johnson vaccines are vector based vaccines. That means that we have Adenovirus, a chimpanzee Adenovirus with the DNA for the spike protein for the SARS-CoV-2 present in it and that is what causes the immune training. So when the vaccine is given into the muscle, the Adenovirus that is injected has a lot of negative charge on it. This is an important part to keep in mind. There are lots of negative charges on the Adenoviruses that are injected in the person as part as carriers of the vaccine DNA. So these are those negative charges. Now what happens is in some people, the vaccine instead of just going into the muscle, some of the vaccine or the Adenovirus escapes into the blood circulation. So now we have negatively charged Adenoviruses that are circulating in the blood circulation. What happens is as these negatively charged Adenoviruses are circulating within the blood circulation, we have other components of the blood that are also circulating in the blood circulation and one important component is platelets. Platelets have platelet activating factor 4 that they release. This factor 4 over here, these orange dots, this factor 4 kind of is released in the platelets that goes to the endothelium and it prevents the happening activation so that unnecessary clotting does not occur. However, this platelet activating factor 4 or this protein gets attracted to this virus, Adenovirus which is negatively charged and this PAF 4 and the virus, they start attracting and binding with each other. So now we have platelet factor 4 bound to a virus and this will look suspicious to our immune system. Now it has the platelet factor 4 has now become antigenic. So what happens is if you see here from the left side, these are the platelets with the effect of 4 in the middle here, this is the Adenovirus that we have injected for the vaccine, it is bound to the platelet factor 4, then this complex of the platelet factor 4 and the Adenovirus washes away into the lymphatic system, reaches the lymph node over there, we have dendritic cells, macrophages, they interact with this, they are phagocyclic cells, they eat it up, they break down these antigens, then they present those antigens to the T cells or adaptive arm, the T cell here is the naiv T cell and my apologies for the more rendered diagram here and less rendered over here because I had not yet drawn these. So anyway this is T helper naiv cell or TH0, when under the influence of the macrophages and in the presence of it, you can 4 and absence of it, you can 12, the T helper 0 would become T helper 2. T helper 2 cell then will cause the B cells to become activated and become active B cells or the plasma cells, these plasma cells would start making antibodies against this vector Adenovirus bound with the platelet activating factor 4 or PFA 4. So now this complex, the aggregated antigen is against which the antibodies will be produced, we or all of a sudden have auto-immunity that has developed. These B cells or active B cells will become memory cells as well and they will continue to produce these antibodies for a long time. So here the B cells have now produced antibodies that are against this complex of Adenovirus and the platelet vector 4. When this happens, these antibodies are now also circulating within the blood circulating system and these have their receptors on the platelets. So on the platelets there are receptors which we say FC, gamma, true receptors or fraction cost constant for IGG gamma receptor type 2. So essentially in simple terms these antibodies have their receptors on the platelets. Now remember that platelets are releasing the platelet vector 4, Adenovirus is present in here as well and when the antibodies would come into the mixture 2, now we have a complete perfect storm to occur and so the antibody would come in bind with these complexes, settle on the platelet surface cause the platelet activation, platelet aggregation would start occurring and all of a sudden we have clotting going on that is thrombosis. And why do we have thrombocytopenia or reduction in platelet count? Of course the platelets are the raw material to make clots. As this autoimmune system start triggering the platelets to coalesce with each other to aggregate with each other to bind with each other to make clots, the overall platelet count would start dropping because the raw material is consumed in making little clot as buildings. Of course those clots would now cause issues, they can cause they can get stuck in blood vessels and whatever organ or tissue in which blood vessel they are stuck that would get ischemia and damage. So the other hand the patient is also now going to become more prone to bleeding because the anti clotting components that is the platelets are reduced in number. So paradoxically the patient is getting the clots plus the patient is also has bleeding disorders. So stroke, coronary disease, GRT issues, renal issues these all can occur and more. So this is the mechanism and if you said well, Mobine just made up this mechanism, here is the study 2 December 2021. Scientists, so this is in the Cardiff University UK, scientists may have solved an important part of the mystery of ultra rare blood clots linked to Ednovirus COVID-19 vaccines and check this out. The participants in this study, scientists from Cardiff University, Arizona State University worked with AstraZeneca to investigate vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. So also keep in mind this one term VITT because you would see that in the latest documentation, AstraZeneca still does not agree and acknowledge that this is a term while they were part of the study in 2021 December. Also known as thrombosis, thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS, a life threatening condition seen in a very small number of people after receiving the Oxford AstraZeneca or Johnson and Johnson vaccines. Now remember it is something to do with the Ednovirus-based vector vaccine, nothing to do with the company itself. Their findings suggest it is the viral vector. In this case, an Ednovirus used to shuttle the coronavirus genetic material into cells and the weight binds to platelet vector 4, once injected that could be potential. In very rare cases, the scientists suggest the viral vector may enter the bloodstream and bind to PF4 where the immune system then views this complex as foreign. They believe this misplaced immunity could result in the release of antibodies against PF4 which bind to the active activated platelets causing them to cluster together and triggering blood clots in a very small number of people after the vaccine is administered. Once again, I would like you to look at the date here, 2nd December 2021. Then the team used a technology called CryoEM to flash freeze the preparations. They were then able to look at atomic level at the structure of the outer protein cage of the virus, the viral capsid that is the shell of the virus, and other critical proteins that allow entry of the virus into the cell. In particular, the team detailed the structure and receptor of CHAD-OX-1 which is adapted from chimpanzee Ednovirus-Y24 and how it interacts with PF4. They believe it is this specific interaction and how it is then presented to immune system that could prompt the body's own defense to view it as a foreign and release antibodies against the self-protein or immunity occurs. First author on the study Dr. Alexander Baker on an already research fellow at Cardiff University said, we found that CHAD-OX-1 has a strong negative charge. This means that the viral vector can act like a magnet and attract proteins with the opposite positive charge like PF4. And then they say, this is December 2021, they are saying modifying CHAD-OX-1 to reduce electro-negativity may reduce the chance of causing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Said Dr. Baker, you may not have heard of these kind of modifications because these folks never cared to look at these problems and see how to fix them. While the solutions were presented. So going back to the telegraph, going back to the latest reporting, TTS which stands for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome causes people to have blood clots and low blood blood blood accounts. 51 cases have been lodged in high court with victims and grieving relative seeking damages estimated to be worth up to 100 billion British pounds. As Sazeneca's admission made in a legal defense to Mrs. Scots high court claim follows intense legal wrangling. It could lead to a payouts of the drug from, if the drug from a firm, if the drug firm accepts that the vaccine was a cause of serious illness and death in specific legal cases, the government has pledged to underwrite AstraZeneca's legal bills. Now scientists first identified a link between the vaccine and a new illness called vaccine induced immune thrombocytopenia thrombosis as early as March 2021. Early after the COVID-19 vaccine rollout began and I actually remember doing a talk about this, the very first study that came was from Germany. And I talked about that. Lawyer for the claimants argue that VATTT is a subset of TTS, although AstraZeneca does not appear to recognize the term. Neither are they recognizing the term nor are they saying that we know the mechanism while their own scientists were part of the studies in December 2021 to understand the mechanism. The government has indemnified AstraZeneca against any legal actions but has so far refused to intervene. The company is pointing out that product information relating to the vaccine was updated in April 2021 with the approval of the UK regulator to include the possibility that the AstraZeneca vaccine is capable in very rare cases of being a trigger for TTS. So now they're saying, well, we always said that this was a case that this could happen. Interestingly, they never said it in the core to documents other than this February. Now this was interesting for me that the World Health Organization jumped in as well to provide their two cents to. The World Health Organization has said the vaccine was safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 and above and the adverse effects that has prompted the legal action was very rare. I do not know who invited WHO to come in and also have their voice in there but they felt it necessary to come in and provide their message. In the months after the rollout, the potentially serious side effects of the jab was identified by scientists. It was then recommended that under 40s be offered an alternative jab because the risk of AstraZeneca vaccine outweighed the harm posed by COVID. The government runs its own vaccine compensation scheme but alleged victims claim the one off payment of 120,000 pounds is inadequate. Doctors obtained under a freedom of information request show that out of 163 payouts made by the government by February this year at least 158 went to recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine. So that is the discussion. This is the list of references and what is interesting for me. Once again I am just going to repeat this one part. What is interesting for me is number one, they still claimed that we do not know the mechanism. And number two, they never in the legal system admitted that this could be happening while other than the legal system. This was a known fact and there are so many studies. If you just Google the Edno virus-based vaccine and blood clotting disorders, you will see a tons of studies talking about the mechanisms and the solutions for that. So this is the discussion. Finally they have admitted it. Now will the UK government indemnify them, protect them or will they become liable for compensations? We will find out but at least they have admitted. And remember this word admitted is being used by the media only after the vaccine giant itself used that word. So if I very quickly go back, I know you cannot see this one but I am going to go back to the original statement by us. In this statement they said it is admitted that the us as anica vaccine can in very rare cases cause TTS. The causal mechanism is not known. This is why they do not want to say vaccine induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia because that in its term has the word vaccine induced and they don't want to acknowledge that. Because of that they are just simply saying it is TTS and we do not know why it happened. So anyways that is a discussion. What do you think should the vaccine companies be on the hook for the compensations? I think that there should be a pool by all the vaccine companies to create a research system and look at those who may have vaccine side effects and help them. If the rare are they are the better it is because we can handle them and compensate them and take care of them more easily. But this should be done. With this thank you very much and I will talk to you later. Please like, subscribe and share and go to drbeen.com to get more lectures as well. Talk to you later. Bye for now."
How Oxford-AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine work - Adenovirus vector vaccine mechanism of action,MedicoVisual - Visual Medical Lectures,2021-01-30,tt9qkwlFkMM,"Hello, I'm Dr. Azal from MedicoVisual.com and in today's video we will talk about the mechanism of action of adenovirus-based coronavirus vaccines. These vaccines include for example the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, the Kansai nose vaccines and Johnson and Johnson's vaccine and some other vaccines as well that use adenovirus factor. As you know the coronavirus it enters into the cell through its spike protein, it attaches its spike protein to the ACE2 receptors and if we block this step we can block the entry of this coronavirus into the cell and thus we can prevent the infection. So what we do is that we try to generate the immune response against these spike proteins. These are the those spike proteins and we generate immune response against these spike proteins to block the entry of coronavirus into the cell as well as to kill this coronavirus before it can cause disease. So what happens here is that as I have told you previously that these vaccines they use adenovirus as a vector or as a transport vehicle to transport the spike protein gene into the cell and then the cell will synthesize the spike protein and then it will train the immune system to fight against this spike protein. So basically if this is our adenovirus and adenovirus are one of the ideological agents of common cold in humans. There are certain types of adenovirus. The problem with using adenovirus as a vector is that many people are huge population of humans they are already immune to the adenovirus. So they can kill their immune system can kill the adenovirus before it can transport the spike protein gene into the cell. For this reason in these vaccines what they do is that they use either the chimpanzee adenovirus to which humans are not usually exposed or sometimes they use less common strains of adenovirus that are less common in humans. For example adenovirus 26 and adenovirus 32. These are less common strains of adenovirus. Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine for example it uses chimpanzees adenovirus and the Johnson and Johnson and Cancer in biologics they use less common strains of adenovirus. The reason is same that they want to mitigate the problem of immunity against the vector itself. So how do we use this adenovirus as a vector? What we do is that we remove certain genes from this adenovirus through some biotechnological methods and for example even and E3 genes are deleted thus making this adenovirus replication incompetent. Not this adenovirus itself cannot cause any disease when it enters into the cell. Then what we do is that as you know the SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and within the RNA, within its RNA there is a gene, there is a recipe to synthesize the spike protein. What we do in lab is that we convert this spike protein RNA through the process of reverse transcription into spike protein double-stranded DNA right. We convert it into spike proteins gene or DNA. Then what we do is that we insert this gene, this spike proteins gene into the adenovirus. So here is that spike protein gene inserted into the adenovirus. Now this is that adenovirus vector based DNA vaccine. Now it can enter into the cell and it can cause the immune response. It can train our immune system to fight against the spike protein. Now let's see how it works. So let's say we gave the injection of any adenovirus based vaccine that is one of the Oxford vaccine. Adenovirus have wide tissue tropism. What do I mean by this wide tissue tropism? It means that it can attach with and in fact a wide variety of different types of cells. Now exactly what cells it can infect? I was also confused about this point. So I decided to contact the Oxford COVID-19 media group as well as Professor Dr. Sara Gilbert. Now this is what this said in the email. They say that this vaccine, it can infect myocytes, skeletal muscle fibroblast and endothelial cells. Professor Dr. Sara Gilbert had said that it often infects the fibroblast through the car receptors. What are car receptors? Car receptors are called coxacchi and adenovirus receptors. This is the receptor that is used mainly by this adenovirus to enter into the cell. So as we have discussed, it can enter into wide variety of cells. Mainly here it will enter either the skeletal muscle cell or fibroblast. fibroblast are abundantly present within the extracellular matrix of the skeletal muscle. So as this adenovirus-based vaccine, these particles, they attach with this car receptors, what will happen is that they will pinch inward. A pit will be formed and then a sack will be formed and this is called endocytotic vesicle. Now this has been trapped into this vesicle. This vesicle has special channels that can pump protons into the vesicle and thus the pH of this vesicle will decrease. The change in pH will cause uncoating of this particle and ultimately what will happen that this nucleocaptor, this outer code. There is that outer code, this outer code will be removed and ultimately this genome of this adenovirus, it will enter. Of course it is not the genome of adenovirus right now, it is actually modified genome, it contains spike proteins. Genof spike proteins. So it can enter into the nucleus and it will remain there as an episomal or extra chromosomal DNA. Here is the symbolical representation of DNA of the cell, our bodies on DNA and here is the DNA that we inserted through this adenovirus vector. This adenovirus vector DNA, it does not integrate with this, humans DNA, it does not integrate with the DNA of cell. How do we know this? Because adenovirus, these are not new viruses. They are known for some decades. They have been causing diseases in humans but but till now there is no evidence that they can integrate into the genome of human. Now here what will happen that this DNA, it will be converted into mRNA to the process of transcription and now this SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins mRNA, it will come out of nucleus. And now here is that mRNA of spike protein. Right? Now from here onward the process is exactly the same as that of mechanism of action of mRNA vaccine. If you have already watched that video on the mechanism of action of mRNA vaccine, you can just skip this part. But here I am going to repeat that process. Now what will happen that this mRNA of spike protein, it will be translated by using the cellular translation machinery, cellular protein synthesizing machinery, it will be translated ultimately into the spike protein. This spike protein will be processed and some fragments of this spike protein will be displayed onto M-MHC type 1 receptors onto the cells. This is a way of telling our immune system that what is happening, what is being synthesized into the cell. So the sample of whatever was being synthesized into the cell is sent into M-MHC1, is displayed onto the M-MHC1 receptors. Meanwhile some of these spike proteins, they will be synthesized and they will be secreted outside the cell. So here is the cytotoxic T cell or CD8 positive lymphocyte. Millions of different cytotoxic T cells with millions of different specificities are venering into the blood. They are trying to find their specific antigen. Let's suppose here comes the cytotoxic T cell that is specific for this spike protein fragment. Now as soon as it comes across this spike protein fragment that was being displayed onto M-MHC1 receptor, it will become active. Similarly, these spike protein particles, they will be picked up by B lymphocytes, the specific B lymphocyte that is specific for that spike protein and then what will happen that it will also become active. Similarly some of these spike proteins, they will be engulfed by macrophages as well as other antigen presenting cells and they will display them onto M-MHC2, not M-MHC1. M-MHC1 was here, here is the M-MHC2. The professional antigen presenting cells display the antigens on M-MHC2, while all other nucleated cells display onto M-MHC type 1. So here it will then activate the helper T lymphocytes. And as soon as this helper T lymphocyte will come across this M-MHC2-bound fragment of spike protein, it will also become active and it will start secreting lots of chemical messengers or cytokines. These cytokines will then activate and they will cause growth and proliferation that is called clonal proliferation of specific cytotoxic T cells as well as B lymphocytes. So lots of copies of cytotoxic T cells, the specific cytotoxic T cells as well as specific B lymphocytes will be formed. As well as it will also cause the clonal proliferation of itself. The lots of copies of specific helper T lymphocytes will be formed. As this specific cytotoxic T cell becomes active, it will destroy this vaccine infected cell. So as to say, right, and then you might be worried here, okay, some of our cells will be destroyed. No, that is not something to worry about. We have trillions of cells in our body, daily some of these cells are lost and they are then replaced by new cells. So that is not something to worry about. Furthermore, some of these B lymphocytes, they will start secreting the antibodies against the spike protein. So anti-spike protein antibody will be formed and some of these cells from these clones, they will form memory cells, memory cytotoxic T cells, memory B cells, as well as memory and protein lymphocytes. And of course, we will have these S protein specific antibodies. Now let's say if an immunized person is exposed to coronavirus, what will happen that these specific S protein antibodies, they will bind with this spike protein and they will begin number one, they will prevent the entry of virus into the cell. Secondly, what they will do is that they will cause the destruction of this coronavirus. And even if somehow this SARS-CoV-2 virus, it enters into the cell and starts secreting its, and starts creating its own protein, that is not a problem as well. We have the specific cytotoxic T cells as well that will immediately destroy this cell as soon as it starts creating the protein. So very few cells will be lost and there will not be the formation of disease. So that's how these vaccines work. Thank you so much for watching this video."
AstraZeneca Vaccine Deemed ‘Safe and Effective’ by EMA,Bloomberg Television,2021-03-18,WcBwliLiz10,"O'r expert committee on the safety of medicines, the pharmaco-vigilans and risk assessment committee has now come to a conclusion on the review of cases of blood clots and people vaccinated with AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine. The committee has come to a clear scientific conclusion. This is a safe and effective vaccine. It benefits in protecting people from Covid-19 with the associated risks of death and hospitalisation outweigh the possible risks. The committee also concluded that the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of thromboc ebolic events or blood clots. During the investigation and review, we began to see a small number of cases of rare and unusual but very serious clotting disorders, and this then triggered a more focused review. Based on the evidence available and after days of in-depth analysis of lab results, clinical reports, autopsy reports and further information from the clinical trials, we still cannot rule out definitively a link between these cases and the vaccine. What the committee has therefore recommended is to raise awareness of these possible risks, making sure that they are included in the product information. Drawing attention to these possible rare conditions and providing information to health care professionals and vaccinated people will help to spot and mitigate any possible side effects. We are also launching additional investigations to understand more about these rare cases and we are conducting targeted observational studies. About 7 million people have now been vaccinated in the EU with the AstraZeneca vaccine, and 11 million have been vaccinated in the UK and there is increasing use of this vaccine in other countries. It remains very important that all side effects are closely monitored and reported so that we can evaluate them and see if there is any need to update the information and warnings about possible risks. Dr Stras will explain the committee's evaluation in more detail, but I want to reiterate that our scientific position is that this vaccine is a safe and effective option to protect citizens against COVID-19. It demonstrated that at least 60 per cent efficacy in clinical trials and preventing coronavirus disease, and in fact, the real-world evidence suggests that the effectiveness could be even higher than that."
"Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine 'safe and effective', study shows - BBC News",BBC News,2020-12-08,6dU_I0zYeBQ,"Researchers have confirmed that the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID vaccine is safe and effective, giving good protection. The paper assessed by independent scientists sets out full results from advanced trials of over 20,000 people and has been published in the Lancet Journal, regulators who will have seen the same data considering the Chabre Emergency Use, our health reporter, Philippa Roxby, is here with me now. Just to explain, Philippa, why this is a significant development in the whole story of the Oxford vaccine? We heard a bit last month about some of the recent data from the phase three trials of this Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine and now they've actually been published so the full data has been made available to us and it confirms what we knew that this vaccine is safe and effective. It protects against illness and 70 percent of people and there were no hospitalisations or severe disease from COVID-19. This backs up what we thought we knew and this is important to the UK because the UK has ordered 100 million doses of this vaccine and it's hoping it's going to get through the approval process quite quickly in the coming weeks. All this data is with the UK regulator right now, the MHRA and they will be analysing it very carefully. There's a couple of things we didn't know which is that most of the participants in this big study of 23,000 people were under the age of 55 so at the moment they don't have quite enough data to say how well it works in older age groups but that's something they'll be able to build up over time but they do know that the immune response in older age groups did look to be good in earlier stages of the trial so they're quite confident that it will work well in older age groups. There's also hint that this vaccine could reduce transmission of the disease and that's something that was hinted before and it's potentially again appears in this data but it's still too early to say for definite. They also don't yet know how long the protection from this vaccine will last for but that's something they can analyse over time. Is there any idea yet how long it will take before we get full regulation then of the Oxford vaccine? We hope it's going to be in the coming weeks. The Oxford researcher said today that they hope it will be soon before Christmas and of course that will add to the Pfizer vaccine which has already been rolled out today and give the UK and most of the world a choice of vaccines which is only going to help to end the pandemic in the long run. Bill Pett thank you very much indeed thanks."
"Three more people die after receiving AstraZeneca vaccine in S. Korea,",Arirang News,2021-03-04,M-DAs44_1Jc,"South Korea's mass immunization campaign is picking up pace amid safety concerns. While no direct link is found, three more post-vaccination deaths reported all of them from AstraZeneca's. Authorities are following up with meticulous investigations. In Germany, there's a changing stance on the AstraZeneca vaccine, allowing over 65s to receive the CHEP, claiming recent studies provided enough data. Kim Dami has our top story. Three more AstraZeneca vaccine recipients that died on Thursday, two were in their 50s and one was in their 20s. Both of those in their 50s were patients at nursing hospitals in Tallahbuk, the province, and at underlying conditions, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. While the first patient died two days after getting the shots, the second person died just one day after. The person in their 20s was suffered from epilepsy, died at a nursing hospital in the city of Taejoon, two days after being given the shot. That brings the country's total vaccine deaths to five. While health authorities believe there is no causal effect, the country's prime minister has vowed to free a full investigation. The government will thoroughly investigate the deaths and openly share the results, so please believe in the government and get your vaccine shots. 515 new cases of AstraZeneca vaccine side effects were filed on Thursday, raising the total to 722. But the country's nationwide vaccination program continues with patients and medical staff at hospitals designated by the health ministry to treat people in critical condition. The president of the Howard National University Hospital Kim Yeon-soo, who got the hospitals a very first job reassures people that there is no reason to be particularly concerned. Meanwhile, COVID-19 variant cases continue to pop up, though most are being identified in people arriving from overseas. The country added six more variant cases on Thursday, filed from abroad and one domestic infection, making a total of 162. Kim Dam-ee, Arirang News."
Sweden to stop administering Moderna COVID-19 vaccine due to risk of heart inflammation,Arirang News,2021-10-07,B88lSMwQS84,"Some European countries like Sweden and Denmark have decided to stop using the COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna for certain age groups due to the risk of heart inflammation. Meanwhile, the U.S. is seeing a gradual drop in its daily infections due to the success of its vaccination campaign. Choi Won-jong has more. Sweden has stopped administering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to younger mana, particularly those under 30. According to Swedish health officials on Wednesday, the reason is due to risk of heart inflammation such as myocarditis and pericarditis. Now pericarditis is inflammation of the outer part of the heart, and myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscles. Sweden's health officials added that it's rare to see the side effects, but will stop administer the Moderna vaccine as a precautionary measure until new data is available. In other parts of Europe, with similar concerns over side effects, Denmark has decided not to give the Moderna jab to anyone under the age of 18. Norway is yet to make its own decision about the Moderna vaccine, but has urged men under 30 to get a fighter shot instead. Meanwhile in the United States, the country is seeing a major drop in daily COVID-19 cases. Over the last two months, the figure has dropped to below 100,000, and thus has dropped by 12 percent to around 1800 days. Experts say it's increasing vaccination rates across the country have helped, adding the fourth wave has come to an end. However, the authorities are stressing that fifth wave could occur over the winter month due to the flu season. Choi Won-jong, Arirang News."
S. Korea reports first two deaths linked to COVID-19 vaccines,Arirang News,2021-03-03,dRX-iVBFQRA,"Just this afternoon, the South Korean government reported the first two deaths linked to the coronavirus vaccines. These people had been given the AstraZeneca vaccine, and their deaths are being investigated as our Choi Won-dong reports. Today, two deaths were reported in people who had received COVID-19 vaccines. We're planning to look into the causes through epidemiological investigations and our casualty investigation teams. This was South Korea's top public health official in a briefing Wednesday, where the first deaths were reported in the nation's vaccination campaign that started last Friday. Commissioner Jung explained the first patient was in his 50s and got the AstraZeneca vaccine and nursing hospital on Tuesday. 11 hours later, he had a severe adverse reaction such as chest pain and breathing issues. He was given treatment but died this morning at 7 a.m. The second person in his 60s also got an AstraZeneca vaccine at a nursing hospital last Saturday. He developed fever and muscle pain 33 hours later and died this morning at 10 a.m. As a Wednesday, more than 87,000 people in South Korea have gotten their first dose, the vast majority of those have been given the AstraZeneca vaccine and just over 1,500 to 5,000. In total, adverse reactions have been reported that 209 people so far. Most of those 207 of them were minor side effects like headaches and fevers. The health authorities continue to recommend that people get vaccinated if they're healthy and to let medical staff know if they have any pre-existing symptoms or conditions beforehand.

S. Korea begins COVID-19 vaccination program for children aged 6 months to 4 years on Mon,Arirang News,2023-02-12,1PtUQQ_b538,"COVID-19 vaccinations for infants and young children begin in South Korea Monday, targeting those aged from six months to 44 years old. According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pfizer vaccines made specifically for infants and toddlers will be used for the inoculation program. The KDC recommends vaccination for young children who suffer respiratory illnesses or those in high risk categories. The vaccine is to be administered three times at intervals of eight weeks and will be available at 840 designated medical institutions nationwide."
S. Korea to offer COVID vaccine once a year from October to November,Arirang News,2023-03-22,vLpeT7gQ2P4,"Starting this year, COVID-19 vaccines will be administered just once between October and November, just like the seasonal flu vaccines. This year, they'll be offered for free. This is according to Health Minister Togu Hong during a COVID-19 meeting on Wednesday. Meanwhile, people with weakened immune systems will be vaccinated twice in spring and fall. High-risk groups, including senior citizens, aged 65, all-order, and those working in nursing facilities are highly advised to get vaccinated. The vaccination program is subjected to be adjusted. Should there be a sharp rise in deaths or serious cases caused by a new variant?"
"No link between AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots, says WHO",CBC News,2021-03-12,N2PHt_rFRzo,"Some Canadians sound like they still need a bit more convincing about the AstraZeneca vaccine. That shot key to this country's plans to protect as many people as possible from the coronavirus. We're already seeing AstraZeneca being given out and administered in expanded vaccination campaigns, but this morning more countries raising new concerns about its safety. Public health officials in this country, though, restating their confidence in the vaccine. So we'll bring in John Northcott to lead off our coverage this morning with John, what some countries are doing, and the very strong response and the word of reassurance from Canadian bodies this morning. Yeah, that's the story. Heather, concerns from a number of countries, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, now Bulgaria and Thailand, at least temporarily stopping, suspending, if you will, the distributions, particularly of the AstraZeneca vaccine. This is something that as this vaccination process rolls out around the world, this probably won't be the last time there are concerns raised here and there, and there are reassurances being issued on this one from a number of authorities, including the WHO saying no causal relationship this morning, no deaths associated with the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Health Canada coming out late last night and putting out a statement explaining the whole rationale behind it. Let's look at that in terms of what Canadian officials are saying. Health Canada aware of reports of adverse events in Europe following immunization with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, and would like to reassure Canadians that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh its risk. The statement goes on to say, health Canada authorized the vaccine based on a thorough independent review of the evidence and determined that it meets Canada's stringent safety, efficacy, and quality requirements. And finally, at this time, there's no indication that this vaccine caused these events. Now, these events that they're talking about here are effectively a thrombosis of a blood clot in 30 cases. Now, this is out of 5 million vaccines administered in Europe and 11 million vaccines administered in the UK. The argument being from health officials that when you give those many vaccines to that many people, especially people potentially in a risk group with comorbidities, there are going to be effects not from the vaccine so much, but health problems that result just because of the age and the condition these people are in. We're hearing similar sentiments from at least one public health officer here in this country. Here's Dr. Dina Hintra. I want to assure everyone that the current doses of COVID-shield AstraZeneca vaccine offered in Alberta have not been linked to these issues. But the bottom line is that there is no current evidence that the vaccine is causing the reported blood clots, and we are not using the same batches of vaccine as we're used in Europe. In fact, we're finding a number of medical experts surprised that, in fact, the countries that we're talking about here today have taken action because they argue there is so little evidence that's listened to whenever experts are just speaking last hour here on CBC News Network. Important thing is, is it happening because of the vaccine or is it happening anyway? What have happened regardless? And I think that right now there's no clear link to their being clots. It's good to be monitoring this, but I think I'm surprised that so many countries have suddenly jumped on this wagon to put a moratorium on the dosing because it wouldn't have public health emergency and the evidence is not that strong. So I guess the question is, Heather, as we look at this this morning, is the issue, is the concern that we should be focusing on whether or not there may be some minor anomalies associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine or is perhaps the larger issue, the clear message getting out there to Canadians and people around the world, the need, the lives that will be saved through the administration of this vaccine, and to overcome whatever hesitancies there may be and stories like this. And we're seeing actions taken by these European countries aren't going to help the public health arguments overall trying to overcome any concerns that people and I should say any hesitancies that people out there have. John, thank you very much."
Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine arrives in UK hospitals,Channel 4 News,2021-01-02,66wJV3-tLUE,"It's delivery day, the first batches of the Oxford AstraZeneca jab arrived at hospitals today. More than half a million doses will be available from Monday as the scramble continues to ramp up production to the vast levels needed. Well what this does is it allows us to focus on the most vulnerable people and make sure they're protected from this disease. And ultimately that's going to keep people well but it's going to reduce the pressure on the health service over the next few months. With that many doctors are unhappy at the government's insistence on getting out at least one dose to people rather than two. Clearly the shortest route to protecting as many as quick as possible. Yes I think it is that simple. The other side if I have to give it some credibility is that people will be disappointed in the delay to their second dose. But that to me seems a very small disappointment compared to the lives that we will save by vaccinating as many people as quickly as we can with the first dose. Over a million people have already received a dose of the Pfizer jab the UK led the world here but it requires ultra low refrigeration. Simple manufacture and supply at required scale for both jabs remain enormous challenges. Every campaign requires three things to come together at the same time. Supplies of vaccine, supplies of people to vaccinate and supplies of people to be vaccinated. Get all three of those working in huge numbers you'll have success. That massive struggle not helped by scenes like this in Britain the on New Year's Eve where two and a half thousand people gathered for an illegal rave in a disused warehouse. Some were British police were attacked when they broke it up and issued on the spot fines. The authorities in Ren are continuing their investigations. And this side of the channel outside a major London hospital and any doctor coming off shift films scores of people who he said had gathered without masks and many were shouting Covid is a hoax. That said the UK start to immunisation compares well globally. Francis achieved a fraction of UK numbers, neighbouring Germany is better but struggling with red tape in its federalised government system. In the Netherlands immunisation won't begin until January the 8th in what's being described as a national embarrassment. Indian authorities are just now approving the AstraZeneca jab as for the USA or Brazil underfunded badly organised a mess. But here with the NHS about to face its most intense period of pressure there's zero complacency about the scale and speed required for the rollout of the second immunisation to come on stream. Joining me now is Charlotte Summers who is the frontline ICU doctor in Cambridge and a member of the intensive care society which is the professional body for intensive care staff across the UK. A doctor Summers thanks very much for being with us. We know frontline ICU's under pressure of course now in a way that's we've not seen since the spring. Where do you sense the real pressure points are going to come in the next week or two? So at the moment we are experiencing in some areas of the UK particularly the southeast, the east of England and London increasing numbers of patients submitted to hospital and to intensive care with coronavirus. But we expect very much that those numbers are going to continue to increase over the next few weeks because of all the mixing that will have happened at Christmas and over the holiday period. But also as a consequence of the delayed period from lockdown so it takes two or three weeks for patients who have acquired the virus out of the community to appear in intensive care. So everything we see now is from two or three weeks ago so we will let them know as to keep rising. Of course when let's get into that just a little bit you use the verb increase the numbers will increase there surely well. Do you mean that actually they'll kind of stabilize in the crisis area of the southeast but that increase will if you like come as a wave out across the rest of England or going to speak we see an increase in the southeast and an exponentially increase across the rest of England because of what you did describe that time delay. So I think what we may see and it is made because we don't know for sure is an increase in the southeast London and the east of England as well as that waves spreading out across the rest of the country. Well political question to a doctor grossly unfair I know but as you see it from your clinical perspective in your colleagues it's tier four working. I don't think that that's necessarily the question that I can answer I think what I would say is that we all have a part to play in reducing the transmission of the virus and in making sure that the pressure on the NHS is as low as possible so that we are available to treat people with coronavirus infection and all the other things that present to hospital we all need to play our part by following the hands face space guidance and the regulations for the tier in which we live. And given that we do that what north is it that you're seeing now at your end at ICU units across the country is it is it frankly like it was in March April. So the pressure is definitely building in particular areas of the country as I've said and yes we are having to stretch staffing ratios and to increase the amount of burden on the staff within intensive care who have been working exceptionally hard for some months now who were asking to do exactly what they had to do in April yet again but having been working harder than they've ever done for ten months since then. Right very brief one here and we know obviously that there's greater infectivity on these new strains of coronavirus. There's anecdotal evidence that younger people are getting it as well and becoming quite ill are you seeing that. So certainly colleagues in the intensive care are reporting that we are getting younger and people who are previously thought to be fit and well appearing in our intensive care units yes. Charlotte some thanks very much indeed for giving us of your precious time appreciated."
Is This a New Side Effect from COVID 19 Vaccines | Ask Dr. David,Dr. David MD,2023-02-01,6gKxdLzf-no,"New research suggests that there may be another side effect associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. Postural orthostatic, tachycardia syndrome, also known as POTS, is a condition where people may suddenly get a fast heart rate or a drop in their blood pressure, especially if they stand up too quick. But for many people, they feel lousy most of the time. Now this can also happen after COVID virus itself. So let's talk about it. Hey, everybody, it's Dr. David. Please, of course, if you're not subscribed to this channel, please do so. Join us and our other social media platforms and become a supporter of ours on Patreon. So postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This is a dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is something that we actually don't have control over. And it controls a lot of bodily functions like breathing rates and heart rates and blood pressure. There are narrow transmitters such as epinephrine, nor epinephrine, and acetylcholine, which direct these different bodily functions. And there's actually two different parts of the system. There's the sympathetic nervous system. This is the fight or flight that you hear about when people have to react quickly if there's a stressful situation. There's also called the parasympathetic nervous system. And this is more what calms the body, relaxing, especially after the stress or danger has maybe settled down. Now the common side effects associated with pots are lightheadedness, fainting, palpitations, mistakes, feeling nervous, feeling anxious or shaking and sweating. And also again, just can feel lousy. Now the timing of this, some people will get it in flares. They may have a couple of good days or good weeks and go back and forth, but there are other people who are feeling this way almost all the time. Now the demographics of this, it's estimated that one to three million people in the United States suffer from pots. Now ordinarily, it is found in most commonly in women under the age of 50, but men can also get it. And I also have seen teens develop this. It's actually one of the things that I've been working a lot on on my clinic and I see a lot of families bringing their teen daughters, especially to me, just diagnosed another one of them today. But a new study that came out just back in December of 2022, that when I was looking at patients at the Cedar Sinai, which is a major hospital and hospital system in Los Angeles, and there were 285,000 people who were part of the study. And these are the number of people who were vaccinated. Okay. 93 percent of them did get a messenger RNA vaccine, which of course, that's probably the numbers that we have nationwide overall. Now, what they were doing is they looked to see what the odds were of somebody getting this developing pots in the 90 days prior to getting a vaccine and then compared it to 90 days after getting the vaccine. Okay. Pre-versus post-type of comparison. They also were looking at other pots related conditions, things such as math, cell, dysregulation, dysautonomia, L or Danlos syndrome. And again, they were looking for 90 days before and after those as well. And there's a lot of crossover between pots and those other diagnoses. Now, there were a total of 4,500 pots related diagnoses that were made amongst the people who were looked at. 2,500 and 80 of them were received the diagnosis and was positive after getting the vaccine. So, if you look at those numbers, that meant that the odds of a pots related diagnosis after getting vaccinated was 33 percent greater than before the vaccine. Now, the authors did note that there were only 25 new cases of myocarditis, which is, of course, what we know is going to make the best characterized, significant side-effect associated with the vaccine. But seven were from before the vaccine and 18 after. So again, there were more after, but there was actually, some of the numbers might have predicted even a little bit more of that, but that's what the numbers are. Now in addition, they looked at 12,460 people who had the SARS infection, the COVID infection, not the vaccine. And again, they looked at the people during this time period, the 90 days before they got the infection and then the 90 days after the infection. And all these were about 1,000 people who developed pots. And a five of them happened after getting the disease, the wild disease. And so when they actually crunched these numbers, they found that a person was five times more likely to develop pots after having the infection compared to after the vaccine. So of course, this is an association. This is not something that's improved that we should actually be making our decisions on, but to point out that as with many other things that we've seen from side effects, relative to the vaccine, that the same symptoms can be seen in a person who has the wild disease and after. Okay? Now, blood clots being another one besides the myocarditis, the pericarditis is again, things that we've seen after both of these things. Now, my theory about all of this is that the problem is possibly the spike protein itself. However, you get it. Now, of course, when a person gets a messenger RNA vaccine, the messenger RNA, which is related to genetic code, is converted to the spike protein. And then the spike protein is what the immune system reacts against. Okay? Whereas when a person has a natural disease, the virus itself is replicating, replicating in many, many cells. And each time that that replicates, of course, there's more spike protein that's produced. So both of these situations will have an increase in spike protein. That's the reason when we do a vaccine tighter for the spike protein. It shows positive whether a person's had the vaccine or whether a person's had the wild disease. Now, the vaccine itself, the messenger RNA, so it has a half life of up to 16 hours. A half life is the amount of time it takes for whatever it is that you're measuring in the blood to be reduced by half. Okay? And it's typically felt that within four to five half lives that the substance is out of the body, which means in this situation that the messenger RNA itself would clear the body in three to four days. Once that's been cleared, there's no more spike protein being made. If there's no more messenger RNA to be read, to be turned into the spike protein. Okay. Now, when a person gets the wild disease, obviously this virus is replicating and replicating the body, it has been cultured out live in over 20 days after a person tied to infection. There's even some very rare cases of much, much longer than that. But for almost everybody, the virus is replicating their body for more than the four days that messenger RNA would be made from the vaccine. Okay? So I do wonder since the spike protein is around longer with natural infection, might that be the reason why these same symptoms, these same side effects are more commonly being seen in people who have the wild disease. Seems that these effects are happening to both sets of people. Okay. Now, whether a person is choosing to vaccinate or whether a person is going to get natural infection, we kind of look at it the same way. The same supplements that we recommend, giving if as soon as a person gets sick, are the same supplements we recommend giving before and after taking a vaccine. Now, of course, other things are really important in terms of optimizing the immune system, because in the end, what this is all about is our body's immune response to the spike protein. Okay? So of course, there are antibodies that are made, there are white blood cells that are produced from memory, and of course, that as part of that process, there's inflammation. So anything that we can do to try to keep inflammation at a minimum, or to have an immune system that allows for the, for the inflammation to not get out of control, that would be ideal. So that's why we talk again and here we go for a plug. I think it's been at least a week since I've given a plug for vitamin D and zinc, but that's such an important role. The moderation, modulation of the immune system without causing suppression, super important. Why we use certain supplements around this, such as high dose vitamin A for a couple days, why I use enhancer, which is a form of activated curcumin, wonderful anti-inflammatory. High doses of omega-3 fatty acids, again, anti-inflammatory. But not just that, lifestyle, we know so much now about the importance of lifestyle in terms of controlling inflammation. Being outside in the sun, not just getting vitamin D from a supplement, but there's an additional benefit with infrared light that can happen from sunlight that you can't get from a supplement, although the supplement is important to get your levels up. But also having just being, having being, and good exercise being in shape overall, right? People who have, have high inflammatory diets as opposed to more anti-inflammatory diet. Of course getting good sleep, getting good exercise, all of those things that we know are so, so important in terms of having a healthy life and trying to fight things up as best that we can. All right, so there you go. You know, this is a condition that seems to be associated both from the vaccine, but also in a greater number following the natural disease. Have a nice day."
"Why AstraZeneca Is Recalling Its Covid Vaccine, Days After Admitting To Side-Effects | Watch",Mint,2024-05-08,I7CH4NkvrdU,"AstraZeneca has initiated a worldwide withdrawal of its COVID-19 vaccine. Last week, it took a big U-turn when it admitted in a UK court that its vaccines can have a side effect. AstraZeneca claims it is recalling its vaccine as there is now a surplus. As per a Reuters report, which quoted AstraZeneca saying that as there are multiple variants of COVID-19 vaccines now available and because there is a surplus of available updated vaccines it has decided to initiate a worldwide recall. The company also said that developed more to updated versions had led to a decline in demand for VAXAV area, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied. Recently, the UK-based AstraZeneca admitted in a court that in very rare cases its COVID-19 vaccine can cause a blood clot-related side effect. The daily telegraph had them reported that in a legal document submitted to the High Caught and London in February for a group action brought by 51 claimants, AstraZeneca admitted that its vaccine which was developed by the company in collaboration with the University of Oxford may cost thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS in very rare cases. TTS is a rare condition in which blood clots form in unusual places in the body. It also leads to a drop in the number of platelets in the bloodstream. As you might know platelets are small cells that help blood to clot, so having too few of them can be dangerous. The AstraZeneca VAXAV area vaccine also manufactured by the Syrim Institute of India was marketed in India as Govishy. Just last week an application was moved in Supreme Court of India seeking to issue direction to form a medical expert panel to examine covisual vaccine side effects. The Supreme Court was also urged by the applicant to issue directions to the centre to establish a vaccine damage payment system for the citizens who became severely disabled as a result of vaccination drive during the pandemic. In the plea, Advocate Vishal Tehwari sought direction to constitute a medical expert panel comprising medical experts from the all-India Institute of Medical Science Delhi headed by its director and supervised by retired justices of the Supreme Court of India. Over 175 crore doses of covisual had been administered in India. The lawyer in his application also claimed that after COVID-19 there has been an increase in the cases of deaths due to heart attacks and sudden collapse of persons. Syrim Institute of India which produces AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine under the brand name Covisual in India is also facing a loss."
AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine EXPLAINED vs Pfizer vs Moderna vs Johnson & Johnson Coronavirus Vaccine,Doctor ER,2021-03-28,49ad3kB7IiU,"The AstraZeneca vaccine has been praised for its cost effectiveness and its easy to store advantages. But recent cases of bloodcots have been linked to the vaccine. Should you be worried? I'll explain. The AstraZeneca vaccine. I've been getting a lot of comments from you wanting this vaccine to discuss. Today, I'm going to go over key facts that you need to know about the AstraZeneca vaccine, such as how is it different from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson? Also, we'll be going over questions like what is the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine made of? And will we even need a fourth vaccine option added here in the United States? We have lots to talk about. Hey everyone, I'm Dr. Jordan Wagner. I'm an emergency room doctor who treats everything from COVID to gunshot wounds, burns, you name it. I've created this video series to help answer your questions and the questions that I get from patients each and every day like you. If you find this video helpful, please hit that like button and subscribe to my channel so you're notified of the latest news and medical tips. So how is the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine different from the others? And how does it work exactly? AstraZeneca's vaccine uses a denovirus vector technology. This altered virus cannot make you sick. But it carries a gene from the novel coronavirus spike protein and triggers an immune response. In other words, AstraZeneca's vaccine mimics a COVID-19 infection without its actual life-threatening side effects, per or released from the company. Johnson and Johnson's vaccine also relies on a similar denovirus vector technology. The Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, on the other hand, rely on mRNA technology. Both approved vaccines require two shots spaced about a month apart. In the meantime, it's likely manufacturers are working toward greater protection against new variants as well. How effective is the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine? Findings are positive as they may promote some global confidence in the vaccine, whereas before, dozens of countries temporarily suspended the use of the shot over concerns about possible rare side effects. These recent findings out of Oxford may just be breathing new confidence into this new vaccine. The trial, involving more than 32,000 participants, was the largest of its kind for any COVID vaccine trial. The vaccine was 79 percent effective, overall, in preventing symptomatic infections, higher than observed in previous clinical trials. However, this news may not make much difference in the United States, where the vaccine is not yet approved and may not need to be. By May, Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson already planned to have enough doses of the vaccine for the United States and the AstraZeneca vaccine may not even be needed here at that point. So, what are the side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine? All four vaccine side effects are similar, including potential injection site pain and flu-like symptoms, including fatigue, fever, headaches, and muscle pains, which are to be expected as your immune system is primed, especially after a second dose. However, at least 10 European nations and Thailand either slowed or suspended AstraZeneca vaccinations reports of blood clotting in people who had received the shot. The European Medicines Agency insists that the vaccine is safe, citing 30 reported cases of blood clots among 5 million people given the AstraZeneca vaccine across Europe. It is unclear if the events are related and more researchers need it to confirm direct causation. The World Health Organization recommends continuing with the nocculations while the concerns are investigated as a precautionary measure. It's important to remember that the vaccines aren't a miracle cure or preventative. They must be combined with masks, hand washing, and physical distancing to work as effectively as possible. No matter which COVID-19 vaccine becomes available to you first, you can feel confident in its ability to protect you, as long as you continue being cautious until positive cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are significantly reduced nationwide and globally. Have you gotten your COVID vaccine if you were able to? What was your experience like? Did you get the Pfizer or the Moderna? Did you have any side effects? Comment below.

"Benefits outweigh risks with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, experts say",CBC News: The National,2021-03-11,0mYYLrVGYcI,"This side I'm assuming everybody's here for vaccine. These Canadians are lining up for the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, while questions around who should be getting it still aren't settled. Danielle Kaplan is now worried about unconfirmed reports of blood clots. It just makes me feel a little insecure, and I would just like this clarified. This vaccine honestly can't catch a break. In Denmark, use of AstraZeneca's vaccine has been put on hold following reports of severe cases of blood clots in people who'd been vaccinated. Other countries have followed suit, but insist the move is precautionary. Bad things happen to people who also happen to get vaccines. And so it doesn't mean that the vaccine caused it. And so that's what they have to investigate. The European Medicines Agency issued a statement saying there is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions. Adding the vaccine can continue to be administered. You have to view it in the context of the number of vaccinations that are ongoing and the frequency of these events in the usual population. As of March 10th, 30 cases of blood clots were reported, including three deaths. That's among 5 million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine within the European Union. Experts say the benefits of this vaccine still clearly outweigh the risks. Is extremely unlikely that there's any kind of issue. And even if there were, the risk from coronavirus is far greater than any risk related to this kind of problem. I think it's more important to have the vaccine than not, but I just want to feel a little bit more confident. While there was talk of certain batches of the AstraZeneca vaccine being investigated in Europe, a company spokesperson says for the record, the doses currently being rolled out in Canada come from a completely different manufacturing plant.

And our role at the EMA is to evaluate these to make sure that any suspected adverse reactions are rapidly investigated so we can figure out, is this a real side effect to the vaccine or is it a coincidence? The number of thrombo and embolic events overall in the vaccinated people seems not to be higher than that seen in the general population. Our priority is to ensure that the vaccines are can be used safely in the European population. If this means that an additional warning might be necessary, we look into that. Trust in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines that we have authorized is paramount for us. And our job is to make sure that we can maintain trust in these vaccines based on a proper scientific evaluation. So while the investigation is ongoing, we are currently, we are still firmly convinced that the benefits of the AstraVisernica vaccine in preventing COVID-19 with its associated risk of hospitalisation death outweigh the risk of these side effects."
New questions over safety of AstraZeneca vaccine for young adults raised by UK - BBC News,BBC News,2021-04-07,hwJ6ra6OXJc,"The safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine for young adults has been in the spotlight today. The UK's leading health experts have issued new guidance following evidence that in extremely rare cases, people who've had the vaccine have gone on to develop blood clots. The official regulator, the MHRA, said the guidance was not proof that the vaccine had caused the clots, but it said the link was getting firmer. So from now on, people aged between 18 and 29 will be offered an alternative to the Oxford AstraZeneca jab. But those who've already had their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should go ahead and get the second dose. Now pregnant women and people with certain blood disorders should consult their doctor for more advice, and the medical regulator has insisted that the benefits of taking the AstraZeneca vaccine still far outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Our medical editor, Fergus Walsh, looks at the factors behind today's changes. Turn up, get your jab. The message remains the same, but in the future, for the first time, the COVID vaccine you receive will depend on your age. That's because evidence is emerging of a link between the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine and very rare blood clots. The UK regulator, the MHRA, said up to the end of March there have been 79 cases of rare clots with low platelets following a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and 19 people have died. That's out of 20 million who received the jab. That's one rare clot in every 250,000 vaccinations. These monitoring systems are now detecting a potential side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca in an extremely small number of people. The evidence is firming up. The balance of benefits and known risks of the vaccine is still very favorable for the vast majority of people. Very few adults under 30 have died from COVID, so that changes the risk-benefit balance from getting a vaccine. It's thought younger adults are at higher risk from clots after the AstraZeneca jab, about one in every 100,000 doses, so they'll be offered a different vaccine when their time comes. Are you worried that this change, of course, might damage vaccine confidence, especially in the young? These are really carefully considered decisions, and it remains vitally important that people who are called back for their second dose come for it, and it remains vitally important that all adults in the UK come forward for vaccination when they are offered it. There was no vaccine hesitancy in Birmingham among those who were getting the AstraZeneca jab. I think the positives outweigh the negatives, so for me, it wasn't really a question of whether I was going to have it. Well, you can get blood clots anytime; it doesn't have to be the vaccine. I'm not bothered at all; I'm very pleased I've had the second one. The European Medicines Agency has come to the same conclusion: there is a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and very rare blood clots, mostly in women under 60. Several EU countries had already restricted the AstraZeneca vaccine to older adults—France to those over 55, Germany to those over 60. Scientists who analyze risk say this change, of course, should not put people off getting a vaccine. This vaccine is extraordinarily effective, and it would be tragic if this led to distrust of this vaccine, or even worse, if it was for vaccines in general for COVID because it has been shown to be amazingly effective; it saved thousands of lives already. Both Conservatives and Labour urged people to get vaccinated. The Prime Minister believes the lifting of restrictions shouldn't be disrupted. I don't see any reason at this stage at all to think we need to deviate from the roadmap, and we're also very secure about our supply. It's thought COVID vaccines have already prevented 6,000 deaths in the UK, and they remain the key to ending lockdown and returning life to something like normal. Fergus Walsh, BBC News. Well, ever since those first reports suggesting a possible link between blood clots and the AstraZeneca vaccine, there have been questions about what it means for the entire UK vaccine program and indeed people's confidence in it. Our health editor, Hugh Pym, explains the potential problems and the effect that they've had so far. Lockdown is easing, the vaccination program is going well, but today there's been a change of course, raising new questions. First, what is the risk with Oxford AstraZeneca? It's lower the older you are, as the potential for serious illness with COVID is weighed against possible harms from blood clots. Some medication, including the contraceptive pill, also has a very small blood clot risk. Anyone who's had a first jab and four days or more later gets severe headaches, blurred vision, or certain other symptoms should contact a medical professional. A committee of Europe's regulator, known as PRAC, drew this conclusion: we know that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been established; it prevents COVID disease, it prevents hospitalization, and it prevents mortality. So in that respect, it feels that the overall benefits outweigh the risks. So will it delay the vaccine rollout? Today, a new jab was delivered for the first time in Wales and Scotland, made by the U.S. company Moderna. It's set to be offered elsewhere in the UK from next week. Health officials say even with under-30s given a choice of alternatives, they're still on course to offer all adults a first dose by the end of July, so the roadmap should stay the same, although it does depend on the supplies currently promised of the vaccines currently in use. The government ordered 100 million doses from Oxford AstraZeneca, though the rollout will slow down this month because of supply issues. From Pfizer BioNTech, it was 40 million, and from Moderna, 17 million doses, though only a limited amount will come through this month. Two more vaccines are being assessed by the regulator, the MHRA: Novavax, where there are 60 million doses on order, and Janssen, 30 million doses. Trials are ongoing with other vaccines where the government has made preliminary orders. So will confidence in the Oxford AZ vaccine be affected? People in younger age groups we spoke to had varying opinions. I'm a bit concerned to hear it because I'm 24 and I've already had my first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and I have my second dose booked in for a couple of weeks. It's one of the very rare cases that it might happen, but it probably won't. The risk is probably worth the risk, right? I'm still all for it. I mean, I'm going to do a little bit more research now into it, but I still think at this point I would get the AstraZeneca vaccine. It remains to be seen how people react to today's announcement, though one leading official made the point that the chance of getting a blood clot through having COVID-19 was much higher than with the AZ vaccine."
AstraZeneca pulls its COVID-19 vaccine from the European market • FRANCE 24 English,FRANCE 24 English,2024-05-09,RIXFWOWHAYM,"It was here in Coventry in 2020 that 90-year-old Margaret Keenan became the first recipient of the Oxford AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. Thank God it happened at the right time for me, you know. So, I'm so pleased. After being given the nod by the European Medicines Agency in January 2021, the jab became the world's third most-used vaccine against COVID-19, with over 3 billion doses supplied in over 100 countries. But nearly four years on, the EU Medicines Regulator said it had grounded the vaccine's European authorization upon AstraZeneca's request. In a statement, the pharmaceutical giant said the decision was made due to a surplus of newer vaccines adapted to target COVID-19 variants. They will withdraw as much as they possibly can, given the fact that we know that that vaccine, which was generated against the original version of the virus, the Wuhan virus that swept across the world in 2020, things have moved on. The virus has mutated multiple times and we're now in the era of these so-called Omricon variants. The shot, renamed Vaxiviria, saw some concerns about its safety, with the discovery of a possible, the rare blood clotting condition as a side effect in 2021. While some countries suspended the vaccine's use, the EMA concluded that this didn't raise the overall risk of clots, and the company overcame these setbacks to sell almost four billion dollars of its vaccine the same year. AstraZeneca is facing a legal case in the UK High Court on behalf of 51 people, claiming to have been affected by the side effects."
South Africa suspends use of Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine due to ineffectiveness,CNBC Television,2021-02-08,Kbp1Ijvd5io,"The show the vaccines don't work as well against the strain dominant in South Africa known as B-1351. The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine offered minimal protection against mild to moderate COVID-19 in a small trial there. Two other trials in the last two weeks also showed lower protection. Novavax 96 percent effective against older strains 86 percent against the strain associated with the UK known as B-117 but just 49 to 60 percent in South Africa. The same for Johnson and Johnson, 72 percent effective in the US but 57 percent in South Africa. Importantly though that one shot vaccine was 85 percent effective against severe disease worldwide. Now we've not yet seen clinical trial data on Moderna and Pfizer's vaccines against the variants but experts say there could be some impact for them as well. All of the companies say they're looking at developing next-generation vaccines in case they're needed. Meanwhile a separate new study suggesting the B-117 variant was introduced multiple times to the US at the end of last year. Likely through travel from the UK around Thanksgiving and Christmas. The spread of that more contagious strain in the US causing some to say we should change our vaccination strategy to try to head it off, giving more first doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to people 65 and older and spacing out the second shot as has been done in the UK. Dr. Fauci today saying we just don't have the data on how long protection from just one shot would last. He notes the second shot provides 10 times higher antibody levels which could mean better protection against the variants and he warns there could be unintended consequences of just one dose. If you get a sub optimum response the way viruses respond to pressure you could actually be inadvertently selecting for more mutants. His recommendation get everybody their prescribed two doses as fast as possible. Chef. Chefard Smith here thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."
Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine prevents spread of COVID from person to person,ABC News,2021-02-04,8xcur3kwCyg,"and for more on the state of vaccination in the U.S. let's bring in infectious disease specialists and ABC News Medical contributor Dr. Todd Allerin. Dr. Allerin, good morning. You know, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine appears to prevent the spread of COVID from person to person. Now that was a big question that we'd been waiting on. So does this offer any more confidence that other vaccines might do the same? Good morning, Diane. This really offers more hope and that's what we're looking for. Just like Whit said, it looks like the AstraZeneca vaccine may reduce transmission by about 50 to 66 percent. They did weekly nasal PCR testing on patient on individuals that were in the vaccine group in the placebo group. And they saw that there really was a reduction in the patients who got positive tests. And so remember, if you're not shedding virus in the nose, it's unlikely you're going to transmit it to other people. So I think and I do believe that other vaccines are going to show the same thing. In fact, Moderna has already basically published the fact that there was about a 66 percent reduction in individuals who got the vaccine before dose one and two who actually had positive nasal tests. So we've had, we've heard glimpses of this before and this is also very good news. So why isn't the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine approved yet in the US? Right. So I think there's a couple of points we have to remember. And the most important one is that there's an ongoing phase three trial of that vaccine going on right now in the United States and it's about to be completed. So I think after the FDA gets that data and also has the data of course from the UK and other countries, they're going to ultimately decide whether to give the AstraZeneca vaccine emergency use authorization. And there's also this research out of the UK and whether people can mix and match the vaccines. How much of a game changer would it be if they find that you can? I mean, if these vaccines could be interchangeable that would be a massive game changer. Why? Because we need vaccine flexibility. This is called heterolegus boosting. You give one vaccine as your initial or prime dose and then the second vaccine is a different one. And there is data supporting other vaccines where we've done that with success. If this is promising, then this could really change the face of vaccine shortages and really help with some of these major challenges. I'm really hopeful that this study will show a very solid immune response, but that remains to be seen that's going on right now in the UK. And Johnson and Johnson is expected to apply to the FDA for emergency use of its COVID vaccine this week. The company says it's 66 percent effective in trials. That's compared to Pfizer's and Moderna's 95 percent. So should we be worried about getting a vaccine that has a lower efficacy rate? I know what you're saying. And what I don't want to see happen is that we think we're only going to give Pfizer and Moderna to our mothers and that we're going to give Johnson and Johnson to our mothers-in-law. That's not... I want you to think of it a little bit differently. I know 66 percent seems much less than 95 percent. But let's talk about prevention of severe illness. That's really the key. And when you look at the Johnson and Johnson data, severe illness was decreased by 85 percent. That's very close. Pfizer's was 90 percent, Moderna's was 100 percent. But these were also small numbers. So this is in range. We're in a pandemic right now, a crisis that we've never seen before. As soon as the vaccine's available, irrespective of which vaccine it is, we have to roll up our sleeves and take that. Now, there have been fears of a vaccine shortage. You touched on that just a second ago. So why can't Pfizer and Moderna work with other pharmacy companies to try to produce more of their vaccine? Right, Dan. People are saying, you know, Pfizer Moderna are keeping their kind of vaccine development a secret and if they could just open up to other companies that we would be able to get much more mRNA vaccine, that is absolutely not true. There's very complex logistical steps that are needed to make vaccine. I'm going to tell you one of the biggest bottlenecks. Taking that messenger RNA and encapsulating it around that lipid, what's called the lipid nanoparticle. Just that step in itself, there's only a few places in the world that could do that. So if you call companies, different pharmaceutical companies, and said, we want you to be able to do this, will you shift your, what you're doing right now and start to make this? They'll be like, we can't do that. So the point is, is that the other pharmaceutical companies are absolutely helping the process. They've called other companies like Pfizer to say, we're going to help you with the finishing fill part of vaccine development. Sonofi has said they're going to get into this. So big pharma is really helping, but you can't just have other companies making message your RNA vaccines. It's not possible right now. All right, Dr. Todd Eller. And always great to have you on and to explain these things."
What's the future of the Astrazeneca vaccine? | Inside Story,Al Jazeera English,2021-03-17,BTD9M8LJPM0,"Several countries in Europe have suspended their use of AstraZeneca vaccine. They're worried about possible side effects. The WHO says it's safe to use, but as Newcastle's search, how will this affect Europe's vaccination roll out? This is Inside Story. Hello, welcome to the program. I'm Hashem Ahalbarra. A growing number of European countries are suspending the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine that concerns the jab may have caused some recipients to develop blood clots, but health agencies say there's no evidence such conditions are linked to the vaccine. And they insist the benefits of vaccines and getting the shots far outweigh any potential risk. This comes as Europe is already short on vaccine supplies and struggling to contain a surge in new infections. Some countries outside the continent have also put their vaccination scheme on hold. That's raising fears about potential effects on people who are already reluctant to get the shot. The European Medicines Regulator and the World Health Organization are now investigating the possible side effects. There is no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions. They have not come up in the clinical trials and they're not listed as known or expected side events with this vaccine. In clinical trials, both the vaccinated people and the people who receive the placebo have shown small, some very small numbers of blood clots developments. The number of thromboembolic events overall in the vaccinated people seems not to be higher than that seen in the general population. The rollout of the AstraZeneca shot has been going on in the UK and Belgium, while some have brushed off the controversy others have shown reluctance about getting the jab. For me, I think to myself, there's always going to be some side effects of all medications, all medicines. I believe it's all in their interests. But overall, when you look at the percentages, the percentage of minor compared to how many people have had it and how many people have had the negative side effects. It's outweighed the cons anyway. For me, I think it's basically a concern which I think is minor. If I could choose, I would rather have a vaccine. Because of the different stories you hear in other countries that have stopped using it. But because I couldn't choose, I came here anyway. There have been a few cases, but not so many in our country. That's why I came to have the AstraZeneca vaccine. All this fuss in the media, it makes me dizzy. I have faith in science. Why should we all give our opinion on it? I think you have more chance of blood clots with COVID than with this AstraZeneca vaccine. More than a dozen countries have suspended their use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Austria was first to pause while investigating a death from coagulation disorders. Days later, Denmark stopped administering the shot after 60 old women died of blood clotting after receiving the jab. France, Germany, Spain and Italy say they are waiting the results of the EU regulators' investigation. Before resuming their AstraZeneca vaccinations. Sweden and Latvia became the latest to announce a pause on Tuesday. And outside Europe, Indonesia and Democratic Republic of Congo have stopped their rollout, while Thailand has just resumed the use of the vaccine after temporary pause. Let's ring in our guests in Barcelona. Jeffrey Lazarus, head of the Health Systems Research Group at Barcelona Institute for Global Health. In Rabat, Azdele Brahimi, head of the Biotechnology Lab at the Rabat Medical School and Professor of Medical Biotechnology at Mohameda Fifth University Biotechnology Society. In the UK, Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology, are the University of Reading. Welcome to your... Jeffrey, now we're waiting to hear from the European medicines agency about the findings of this particular case. But they seem to be indicating that they might be in favor of resuming the vaccinations, particularly when they say they have the overall numbers of the cases related to the throttling in these cases related to the thromboinbleic events that we had so far do not seem to be concerned. That's right. It will be a sleepless night for many, but we are, right now, expecting the European medicines agency to report that there is not a greater number of cases among those who have been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, than we would expect in the general population. As Dean Imeroko, vaccination campaign has been going normally over the last few weeks. It's been fine, credited by the international community as doing well, but people are now pretty much concerned, particularly knowing that Morocco is and has been using AstraZeneca vaccine. Well, actually in Morocco, I think, thank you for the question, Hashem. We have almost like 5 million people that got jabs from the AstraZeneca. And so far we have four people with this indication, but I think it's really amazing, amazing that we are having this discussion right now, and having this discussion from European countries, without that science is coming from Europe. But I think right now I think it's more politics than science because I don't see any scientific person around the world can say that there is an effect or an indication that this kind of reaction that we are having and the thrombosis is caused by the AstraZeneca vaccine. Simon, I think as Dean is talking about this disconnect between what is political and what is scientific, given the fact that we have 17 million people who have taken so far the vaccine, and you have 40 cases somehow, 40 cases of blood clots, when you look at the percentage itself, is it does it make really sense to talk about any causal link? Well, no, really isn't a causal link based entirely on the numbers, at least from what we've been told by European regulators, I do wonder whether they have their eye on other factors. But if they are, then they need to be very honest and very open about it, because at the moment all they're really doing is frightening people, and I think there is evidence of some vaccine hesitancy now even in the UK, when really it's not based on any numbers or any real correlation as fast as we can see. Jeffrey, how do you think should be leading now the fight against COVID-19? Because from the start we have always been having this problem between the scientific community and the political establishment, and we do understand why politicians are on the world, particularly in Europe, are pretty much concerned that they would like to be shown as taking the lead in saying no when it is no. But from now onwards, how do you see things unfolding in Europe in particular? It has to be the scientific community. I mean, there's a reason we have a European medicine agency, and to date they've been saying that there is no evidence to stop use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. So now they're conducting an investigation under I think under political pressure, but we are where we are. There's an increased perception of risk among the population, as was just mentioned, and I'm hoping that tomorrow they will confirm what they've been saying all along, that this low number of cases is not linked, that there's no causality between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots. And if that's the case, we'll be able to resume the vaccination campaigns, but it will be quite challenging now with some of the public, some of the population losing some of their confidence in the vaccines, but hopefully increasing their confidence in the process. As Dean, you brushed aside the concerns as purely political in Morocco. How does it go? Now, you've been giving the vaccine to hundreds of thousands of people, particularly AstraZeneca. And you've been doing the follow-up and you seem to be confident there's no concern. There's no concern. You're not concerned at all. But actually, we did it in Morocco that the right way, actually. I think it's amazing that someone would stop using a drug or a vaccine to harmonize the politics in Europe. When I see the statement from the French presidency, actually, I'm really hallucinating. I think I'm not talking about Europe anymore, because in Morocco, we did it the right way. The right way, we have the scientific committee meeting and we discussed how many cases we have, and we thought that we read four cases in Morocco over six million people that were actually vaccinated with AstraZeneca. I think the benefits is there. I think I agree with my friend, with my colleague, actually, how can we manage now the damage done, actually, to the confidence or to the trust of the population? I think it's what's happened in France is a really emissary, I think, first and in Germany, also, actually, when you have in Germany, actually, seven cases over 1.7 million people vaccinated. I think, if it was German company, do you think that they would have stopped the vaccination? I don't think so. I don't think so. I really am really angry about that. I think it's a really amazing this kind of decision. Simon, we're talking about the EU, which in normal landscape should be leading in the fight in the vaccination campaign, which doesn't seem to be the case. Now, if you look at the situation, the way it is, particularly when it comes to the AstraZeneca vaccine, so far, it's been established scientifically that no one was hospitalized or became seriously ill due to COVID-19 after receiving the first jab. Wasn't this enough on its own for the political elite in Europe to say, you know what? We see the concerns there, but we have to go on. That's, yeah, that's an entirely reasonable thing to say. Even if there was a small effect on blood clotting, you would have to weigh that against the positive effect that the vaccine has on protecting people from COVID-19. Very few things are without any risk at all, taking paracetamol represents a risk. Getting onto an aeroplane represents a risk for deep vein thromposis, but people still do it because they judge the benefits from those things to outweigh the risks. So even when there are no risks, we certainly don't know that to be the case with this vaccine from COVID-19, then people still make rational decisions to proceed with them. So that should have been taken into consideration, and I hope we'll be. Jeffrey, where does it leave AstraZeneca the company itself? There has been battered from day one by all sorts of challenges and problems. You remember at the beginning when it was, many countries recommended not to administer the vaccine for people who are older than 65, and then they reversed that decision. Now you have this suspension. What does it leave the company? The short term future of the AstraZeneca vaccine is clearly in jeopardy, but hopefully that will change tomorrow. And I think they will. The EMA clears the vaccine for use. I hope that all European Union member states will accept that, and then the companies in good shape again, because the AstraZeneca vaccine is an important tool we have. I mean, fortunately, the world has other vaccines with Pfizer, Moderna, now Johnson and Johnson, and others from Russia and China, but the AstraZeneca vaccine was specifically developed so that it could be used at a low cost, all around the world. So it's an extremely important vaccine. And right now, yeah, the company is in a tough spot, but the European medicine agency has made it clear that they do not think there is any causality. As did you remember, the scientific committee that decides how to move forward in Morocco, which kind of medicine to acquire in the near future, given this debate about AstraZeneca, you have been using sign of farmer and AstraZeneca for some time. Is this something which is going to pull more pressure on you guys to look up for other alternatives like Johnson and Johnson, or Moderna, for example? Well, for more, I mean, quite clear. We just authorize actually to get AstraZeneca from Korea through the COVAX initiative from the World Health Organization. And I think we get our share of that. The other thing we order to actually to some sputnik vaccine after emergency utilization. I think it's tough to get Johnson and Johnson because the American has all the orders and they will keep it for them until the end of the campaign for mass vaccination. I think from Morocco, and I have to come back to talk about the benefits because we see that we are allowing chemotherapy, actually. And everybody knows the chemotherapy may be scaling more people than the cancer. And we keep it as a therapy for people because the benefits is there. And here, we have 70 million people in Europe actually that we're vaccinated with AstraZeneca. And after that, we have 40 people that were actually shown maybe, maybe. It's really, we have to keep it this way because there is no clear indication the link between the two would decide to stop it. I think it's not good for Europe. It's not good for us because now we have to go through all our idea to explain why we keep using that. Simon has been baffling to some people that while in a country like where as the incomes from Morocco, the vaccination campaign has been doing very well. In Europe, it's been slagged, a disaster according to other people. You've been having the delivery shortfalls by AstraZeneca. And that this, against the background of all these problems, the European Union does not seem to be having some sense of clarity about how to tackle vaccination campaign. It's creating more problems for doctors. Yes, they just don't seem to have got themselves organized in a way that many other countries, including the UK, have. And that is a great shame because of course, the European Union is made up of advanced nations who, for the most part, would be perfectly able to cope with something like this and not only ordering the vaccination, but making sure that it was administered to their populations. So really, this is a lack of organization, not only in terms of ordering them far enough in advance, but also for distributing them and making sure they can interpeople. And this is not the only challenge that AstraZeneca has been grappling with. A report from the Wits University in Johannesburg says the AstraZeneca vaccine is less effective against the South African variant. It was found to be less than 60 percent effective at preventing mild to moderate infection. The earlier trial was carried out on more than 2000 participants, but despite the setback, wider data show the vaccine can still prevent severe illness. And that's from COVID-19. South Africa holds the use of AstraZeneca in February. Jeffrey, it's all about now perceptions. It's all about the confidence in AstraZeneca. Do you see them now under massive pressure to manufacture a third dose that would restore confidence in the company itself? Well, I do. I think they need to look seriously at the situation with the South Africa and variant, or the variant observed in South Africa. And the other companies as well are looking into how to either rejig the current vaccine or develop boosters. So that's important. But importantly, we need to remember that the AstraZeneca vaccine does work against severe cases, even with the South African variant. And of course, across Europe, with that variant, isn't so widespread. It's not as big an issue. As did in Morocco, variants, mutations are something we have to deal with in the near future because the virus is still around. Is this something that is taken into consideration by the government? Absolutely. I think it's something that's really very important to deal with. And I think in Morocco, we are trying to say we have the British, the variant, the B1 variant, extra. And I think we are watching it closely. And I think by the end of April, this variant will be the dominant one in Morocco. But I think what we are really having in Morocco, a great situation to have a mass vaccination because the plots is down and we have the infection rate is lower and the death numbers are lower. And I think if we do greatly with the mass vaccination, hopefully we can soon try to see the end of this pandemic in Morocco. Simon, I think this is a case that in a way or another shows us the need for some sense of humility because we are an unsharted terrain and we're learning by the day from this particular case because if you go back to this particular cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, it was detected in Spain but then the same day they saw that there were some cases in Norway and Germany and everyone freaked out and said, you know what? I think it's about time just to shelve everything for the time being. We are likely to see similar cases related to similar incidents in the near future. How do you think we should move forward tackling this particular issue? At the same time, maintaining the momentum of the vaccination campaign? Well, I think that people get blood clots. They happen in every country every day and unless there is a very clear numerical association between vaccination and these blood clots, then really all that should be done is a careful increased observation, increased surveillance of the situation rather than pressing the panic button when really it's far too early to start panicking because if you do that and you do it unnecessarily which does appear to be the situation at the moment, then you will frighten people away from the vaccine and you will make them by definition therefore more susceptible to COVID-19. Well, Jeffrey, we have the frightening people for quite some time and you have people who have always been skeptical about the vaccine. Comes this particular case and the suspension of the use of AstraZeneca at a time when every day that goes by without vaccination being administered in many European countries could really mean a difference between life and death and under this particular landscape, why should the EU move forward? Well, we have really fed the monster, those who are strongly opposed to vaccination, although that's often a small number there, they're very vocal. So I do agree with Simon that the issue is we need to investigate the cases but we didn't need to necessarily suspend its use and that Europe didn't act as a block or follow the recommendations of the European medicine agency. I think also creates, reduces some of the confidence in the system. So moving forward, Europe needs to really show after the decision tomorrow that we will secure more vaccines, we will administer them more rapidly and that we will work country by country, population by population to build the confidence. We really need a strong European and even a stronger global campaign to build vaccine confidence. As Dean, are you likely to further scrutinize the track records of any pharmaceutical company in the near future because of this whole issue about vaccine safety? Well, I think the clinical trials were there to show that this vaccine is safe like the others. I think it was amazing also that when you look at the other vaccines and they have to say that Pfizer has the same effect on a limited number of people. Moderna has the same thing and it's surprising that the only one that gets really hits by the EU is AstraZeneca. Maybe the AstraZeneca is not available in Europe but that's just a really commercial and political decision, nothing to do with science. I think we have to go back to the basic scientific committees decide if the vaccine is safe and it's efficacy and the quality of production and I think that's what we are trying to do and we need some leadership from Europe to do that also. Simon, if we are to pause just for a second and look at the overall picture which is the fight, the global fight against COVID-19. Those who are optimistic were thinking that if things go hunky-dory by September, October or November we could reach some sort of herd immunity in some parts of the world. 2022 would be the beginning of the end for COVID-19. Do you see that optimism still prevailing against the backdrop of this particular case of AstraZeneca vaccine? I think that sooner or later if I'm very soon the AstraZeneca vaccine won't be restricted in its use. I think people will have come to their senses but if we get much more of this when it's groundless it's perfectly acceptable when there's a reason to do it but if we get more groundless speculation about this sort of thing then we'll end up in a situation where we keep pushing back, pushing back on our sort of time frame to to beat COVID-19. You're quite right. Come the autumn, many countries, the UK certainly will, hopefully, should be looking at herd immunity to effectively stop the spread of the virus in their populations and then in 2022 you'll see more of that around the world but quite simply if you make people frightened of the vaccine and there are people who do want to do that then you're pushing it back into your, like I said earlier, exposing more and more people around the world to the risk of death from COVID-19. Looking forward to hearing some very positive news in the upcoming days for that roll out to be continuing, increasing, spreading all over the world and putting it into this disease that has shattered many, many lives. Globally, Jeff Villasales Azdeni Brahimi Simon-Klaak, I really appreciate your insight and your time looking forward to talking to you in the near future."
Coronavirus COVID 19 Oxford AstraZeneca Vaccine Information,AbrahamThePharmacist,2021-02-08,wLLCpn2xaq8,"So last week's video was all about the Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 vaccine. This week's video, as I promised, we're going to be looking at the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. You guys have sent loads of requests to do a video on this topic from my previous post where I was getting the vaccine and also my post whilst I've been involved in the COVID vaccine clinics. So in this week's video, we're going to be looking at the evidence all about the COVID vaccine. We're going to be talking about how it works. We're going to be talking about side effects. We're going to be talking about who should get it, who shouldn't get it, and also everything we know about the COVID-19 vaccine so far and having it during pregnancy and loads, loads more. Now before we begin, I just want to make you all aware that this video was filmed on the 23rd of January 2021. Therefore, all the information in this video is up today on this day. However, this information is most likely going to change in the future. So the best way for you to stay up today is to always speak to your healthcare professional and also visit the NHS and WHO website all about the COVID-19 vaccine. I will leave links to it in the description below. So just stay up today with it. Okay, so let's begin with the first topic. How does the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine actually work? Well, to help us understand this, we first need to understand how the actual COVID-19 virus works and then we'll be able to understand it a lot better. So I'm going to try and simplify it to the best of my ability. So to begin with, we have the COVID-19 virus and it has on the outside what we call spike proteins. Now these spike proteins help it connect or attach to your healthy cells. So once the spike proteins have stuck to your healthy cells, the COVID-19 virus is able to pull itself into those healthy cells and take over. This is otherwise known as an infection. Now the problem is the COVID-19 virus is very good at not getting caught. It's very good at being able to hide inside those cells, which means it's difficult for your body to find it and kill it and get rid of it. So this means that the virus is able to use the tools within your healthy cell to multiply and replicate. And once it does this, it's then able to go and infect more healthy cells. Now the problem is it takes a bit of time for your immune system to notice this virus, but once it does, it starts to build defense proteins which we call antibodies. Now these antibodies are then able to stop these spike proteins that we just spoke about from sticking to more healthy cells. Now on top of that, your antibodies can also send signals to your immune cells called T cells. T cells are able to then come along and gobble up the virus so it's no longer able to attack your healthy cells that we just spoke about. They can also send signals to other immune cells to come over and help us to get rid of this virus. Okay, so you now have a brief understanding of how the COVID-19 virus worked, which is great. It's going to be really easy for you to understand how the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine worked. So in short, this vaccine contains a dead virus shell. Think of it as an empty egg shell, for example, without the EY or the EGO kinnet. This dead virus shell is called an adenovirus. Now there is decades of research on using adenoviruses to help us with vaccines and to deliver whatever we want to put inside them within your healthy cells. Now for the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, what we put inside this adenovirus inside that empty egg shell that we just spoke about is a small bit of genetic code from the COVID-19 virus. That genetic code is the part which teaches, well, which uses the healthy cells to make the spike proteins that we just spoke about. So then spike proteins that are needed to attach to your healthy cells. So your healthy cells are able to read the COVID-19 genetic code that we've used in the vaccine to produce those spike proteins that we spoke about earlier. So your body is creating their spike proteins. It says here you go, look at these spike proteins immune system and make me some antibodies and make me some T cells which we just spoke about, which means that we're not waiting for that lag period. We're not waiting for your body to learn how to fight against COVID-19. We are creating the actual antibodies and the T cell so they're ready. They are ready to fight the floating around in your bloodstream. So then if you do get infected with COVID-19, hopefully your symptoms are going to be very minor and you're easily going to fight it off. So I hope that made sense but I know what you're thinking. You're probably now thinking, well, what happens to that DNA and what happens to that adenovirus? Well, the good news is it takes a couple of days and your body breaks them both down and gets rid of it. So don't be worried about it. Also, the adenovirus, if you remember what I said about earlier, is it's a dead virus shell, so it can't replicate, it can't really do anything and it can't cause you any harm. Please remember as well, the DNA, the genetic code bit that we actually are using from the COVID-19 virus is just the bit that we need for the spike proteins. So it's not the entire genetic code to infect you with COVID-19. So you cannot get COVID-19 from the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Okay, so in this part of the video, I want to talk about the research and the clinical trials done on the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. This is going to be really factual. I'm going to keep it brief but please remember, this is real science and action, so it's going to be some great stuff. Also, if you are looking for some specific information in this video, I am aware this is going to be a really long video. I have one to chapter it in the description below. So if you're looking for some specific information, feel free to click on that description and click on wherever you want to go. Now let's begin. So the initial trials involve 24,000 people of different age, gender, ethnicity and race. These were done in the UK, Brazil and South Africa, which is great to see because it's such a broad population that you're using, which is really important in clinical trials. There are also still trials happening within the United States, Japan, Kenya and India, which is great to know that we're still getting updated by scientists across the world on the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Now here's the fun bit. To measure the effectiveness of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, scientists measured how many antibodies were produced against the spike proteins that we spoke about earlier. Now, after the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, scientists found a high amount of antibody production, which is great use, but here's the better bit. So even up until the second dose, scientists found that their antibodies were still high, which means that even after the second dose, you're going to have even more antibodies that you had in the first place. Now, what does this mean? A high amount of antibody production? Well, in theory, if you have a high amount of antibody production, in theory, it's going to mean longer protection against the COVID-19 virus. However, this is still being researched, so please watch this space. And finally, 11,000 people within the phase three clinical trials of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine showed that this vaccine has a 70.4 percent efficacy against developing COVID-19 symptoms. Now, it is important to note that we still don't know whether the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine will protect everyone from getting ill or everyone from getting serious illness from COVID-19. We also don't know how long the protection will last, so whether it's going to need a booster dose, or you're going to need no doses in the future. And we also don't know whether the COVID-19 virus will mutate or change with time. And if any updates need or changes are needed, which is why scientists are constantly monitoring this and checking it to stay on top. Okay, so now let's move on to how do you get the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine? How is it administered? Well, it's an injection, it's intramuscular, and it's in the deltoid right over here. When you've had your first dose, you don't need to wait 15 minutes to check for allergies or anything like that. This is different to the Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 vaccine. However, if you are going to drive, you should ideally wait 15 minutes before you drive. If you want to go home straight away, it's preferable that you get someone else to pick you up to drop you off and take you home, basically. The second dose of this vaccine is given at least 28 days from the first dose. It's a two-dose vaccine similar to the Pfizer one as well, which is a two-dose one. So now let's talk about who can get the COVID-19 vaccine. If you're based here in the UK, please remember the COVID-19 vaccine is free of charge on the NHS available to anyone who wants it. Now, obviously, there is a rollout plan for it and a high priority group will be going first. This is going to be changing often. So the best thing I'd advise everyone to do is click on the NHS link, which I'm going to leave in the description below and stay up to date with it. So the NHS is currently offering the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to those at most risk of COVID-19. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to leave a little box here somewhere with that list of people who are the first ones who are the most at risk who are able to get the vaccine now. But please remember, this list will be growing. It's going to get wider and wider with time. The Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunization, which is called JVCIF, for sure. These are the people who are really smart and they advise us on who to do first who are the most at risk, but they will constantly be changing this. Please also remember that the NHS will let you know when it's your turn for your COVID-19 vaccine. There will be in touch with you. Please don't bother contacting your GP surgeries who are already super busy about the COVID vaccine. There is an order, the JVCIF have determined that order, and your surgery will be in touch with you. They have not forgotten about you. They will be in touch with you. And on an even more serious note, there have been quite a few scams happening recently with regards to the COVID-19 vaccine. People are being called out of the blue from unknown numbers, pretending to be the NHS asking for money and personal details to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Please do remember, this is a scam. The NHS will never charge for the COVID-19 vaccine. This is always going to be free. Please don't give out any of your personal details and hang up the phone if anyone calls you with this scam. So next up, we have who cannot get the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. So currently, if you have a severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic reaction to any of the ingredients in this vaccine, you should not be getting it. Now, if you're wondering about those ingredients, I am going to leave a full list in the description below. So please check it out. Also, if you're first dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has caused the severe anaphyl reaction or a severe allergic reaction of any sort, your second dose should not be the same vaccine, and you will have to discuss this with your healthcare professional. Another set of people should avoid getting this COVID-19 vaccine currently, including pregnant women and those who are 18 and under. However, this information may change with time, and I'm going to talk about this in more detail after the next point. And please do remember, if you currently have COVID-19 or if you are recovering from COVID-19, please do not go and get your vaccine until you're fully recovered. If you're unsure about this at all, please contact your healthcare professional speed to them, but the last thing that we want you to do is to go to these vaccination centers, these hubs, wherever you go, and then to spreading COVID-19 to other people. So if you're unsure at all, please speed your healthcare professional. Okay, so now let's move on to pregnancy and let's talk some science. You're probably aware that a lot of vaccines can be given safely during pregnancy. So the question is, why are you now being advised not to get the COVID-19 vaccine right now during pregnancy? Well, to be quite honest, for you, it's very simple. The COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been tested in pregnancy. This means that until more information and more research is available on this, those who are pregnant should not routinely get the COVID-19 vaccine. Now, please remember, though, that evidence from non-clinical studies of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine have raised no concerns about safety and pregnancy. So non-clinical evidence is required before any clinical studies can be done during pregnancy to check its safety. So this is usual protocol that until you have that information to avoid the vaccine, avoid COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, until we have more information on them clinical studies are done. So please remember these facts, and this is usual protocol. It's nothing different to what we usually do. There's no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe during pregnancy, but basically we just need more information and we need more research on it until we can recommend it routinely for patients. Unfortunately, there's a lot of misinformation on this topic, so I really hope this information helps. Now in the UK, the JVCI currently recommend two situations where you may be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. The first one is if your occupation puts you at a higher risk of COVID-19, and the second one is if you have any health complications or conditions that could put you at a higher risk of having complications from getting COVID-19. Now in terms of breastfeeding, there's currently no data on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine or breastfeeding or breastfed infants. Despite this, the COVID-19 vaccine is not thought to be a risk to breastfed infants, and the benefits of breastfeeding is very well known. Now because of this, the JVCI has recommended that the vaccine can be given to those who are breastfeeding. This is in line with the information given in the USA and by the WHO. And once again, please do remember that this video was filmed on the 23rd of the first 2021. All the information I'm giving you today is up to date on this date. However, this information can change with time, whether we get more research and we find out more information, so the best thing you should always do is speed to your healthcare professional. And also, visit the NHS and WHO website, the links I'm going to leave in the description below to stay up to date. Okay, so I hope you're still with me. I hope you're still enjoying the content of finding this information helpful. If you are, make sure to whack that like button just to show that you're enjoying the content and you're finding it helpful. Now let's talk about the side effects of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. First of all, the side effects are very similar to other vaccines. The main side effect is the sore arm. I know I had a sore arm. I had a sore arm for about three to four days afterwards, saying my friends, saying my colleagues, and that was probably the main side effect. The other side effects to be aware of as well, however, is that it can cause a temperature which can last for about 48 hours a bit of a fever. This is normal. You can also have a bit of a headache. You can feel a bit tired. You might feel a bit nauseous. You can have a few aches and pains in your joints and muscles. These are all normal and they will go away. Now so far, people aged over 65 have reported the fewest side effects. Also, it supports to remember when you get your first dose. There might be a bit of redness, a bit of swelling for a couple of days, but this should go. Please do let your health care professional know when you go for your second dose, how it was, if you experienced any side effects. That's really useful for them to know as well. Please remember as well, when you get your second dose of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, you're less likely to have the side effects again. Now, if you're struggling with any of these minor side effects such as the fever or the aches and the pains, then you can take over the counter and all GZF. It's required, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, but always speak to your health care professional first before you take any medications. This is super important and always read that information leaf that comes with the medication. It's a both super important just to make sure that you're safe and suitable to take the medication because your safety is the most important thing. Now, another thing that I'd like to mention to you is something called the yellow card reporting scheme. This is something that we've been doing for many years in the UK and we do it for all medicines, new ones, old ones, whichever. You can fill out a yellow card report for them talking about any side effects or problems you had with that medication. So, it's even more important for new medicines like the COVID-19 vaccine for example that we do these yellow cards because we're going to gather more data, more evidence and gather it all and collect it altogether. It's going to be really helpful for scientists and health care professionals not only here, but all over the world. So, if you can, you can do this online. Anyone can do it. You don't have to be a health care professional if you've had the vaccine and you've had any side effects or problems with that at all. Please do fill a yellow card because it's going to be super helpful for all the scientists around the world. Another point I'd like to mention is please remember that if you develop a continuous cough, if you lose your sense of taste or smell at all or a reduction in it or if you have a constant fever or a temperature over 37.8 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, then these could be a sign of COVID-19, these classic symptoms that we're all probably aware of. You may have got it before the vaccine. You may have got it after the vaccine. This is a possibility. So, please remember these rules still apply to everyone. So, if you do get these symptoms, please self-isolate. Follow your government guidelines here in the UK. Please visit the NHS website and please arrange yourself a COVID-19 test whilst you're self-isolating. And now onto the final burning question. How long is this vaccine going to be effective for? Unfortunately, we can't see into the future. So, we're still not sure about this. Scientists are still researching into this. There may be a case that in the future we might need a booster. So, after your second vaccine jab, you might need a booster every six months or a year. Similar to how we do the flu jab, for example. But this still has to be proven. We're still researching into it and trying to find out more information. We also don't know yet if it stops the spray, if it stops the transmission of the virus, this still hasn't been proven. So, the best information I can give for this is please just stay up today. Look, the information I'm giving you today is up to date for today, really. Okay? So, you need to stay up to date with the WHO, with the NHS, with any organisations that you follow in your country, where you're watching this video. And I will leave links to these in the description below. So, for my final thoughts, I think that the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has proven to be safe so far. The clinical trials that we spoke about earlier showed no safety concerns, which is exactly what you want to hear. And the clinical trials would involve a large number of people. They're still being done as well. And also, they would involve a diverse number of people, different age, different ethnicities, which is everything that you want to see in a clinical trial. But this by all of this, please do remember that if you do get the COVID-19 vaccine, we still need to maintain social distance. We need to wash our hands often. We need to wear the face masks. All of these things still need to remain in place, because we still don't know whether the vaccine stops transmission, that hasn't been proven. And there still is a chance that you can catch COVID-19 even after the vaccine. So, it's super important that we still maintain the social distancing and all the things that we've been doing currently. So, as I did mention earlier, even if you've had the vaccine, if you still get these kinds of symptoms of COVID-19, such as the constant cough, the loss of taste or smell, the high fever, any of these sort of symptoms, which we know of COVID-19, the rules still apply. You need to self-isolate. You need to follow your government guidelines. If you're here in the UK, you need to self-isolate. Go on the NHS website and get yourself a COVID-19 test as well. I will leave links to it in the description below. And just to remind you, one last time, this video was filmed on the 23rd of January 2021. All the information I've given today is up today. Today, this information can change with time. So, please stay up to date with information online from the WHO, the NHS, and also your local government websites that you know and trust."
DOH: AstraZeneca vaccine will have new precautions when use is resumed for under-60s | ANC,ANC 24/7,2021-04-11,8-hrD1KUV40,"from a businessman watching right now. Do you know that they imported AstraZeneca? So the question is when will you allow AstraZeneca to be used again? So what's the status now with Astra? Where are we going with Astra considering the business sector, conglomerates, ordered AstraZeneca for essentially their workers. Of course, you said workers in companies are below 60, right? You know, when you're 60, retired, you're going to corporate work usually. So what will they do with all the Astra that they ordered? Yes, well, actually, this is what we call the Pugs Suspend is temporary. It's a precautionary measure because you can have a lot of money in other banks. That's what they're doing. That's why FD decided. So what they do is evaluate the experts and the WHO. What they do is they only have extra indication or extra precaution with the use of AstraZeneca. So you will resume it. You're saying when the Astra orders come in, the business sector can use it, but you will just add specific guidelines. There are guidelines. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. The most likely, what is the precautionary measure? Most likely, ma'am. The specifics are different. I don't like to preempt it because the experts will give us that recommendation. But what I just wanted to say is that we don't have any identity and actually, that's what they are doing. They are saying that the experts are even WHO. The benefits still outweist the risk. So they are still doing it. What are the better guided? What are they doing? Make coordination. But how is it coordinated? This businessman says, Secretary Vince, he's on Secretary Galveston. They didn't know that Astra was going to be suspended. How would it work to help like that? Do you all talk to each other or the FDA makes a decision on its own with a health department? Well, the Food and Drug Administration is a regulatory authority. So this is an independent decision. Although FDA is overseen by the Department of Health. But as to this regulatory process, this is something that has been decided by FDA. And then after the decision, it is informed by the vaccine cluster. So that is the process. If you were to have your way, would you still have wanted another week of ECQ, ma'am? Because I watched you with Christian Izgera and you did say no on that technically one week isn't enough and true enough it extended to another week. Just to ask you, what are your thoughts, health wise? Well, ma'am, if I was to have a meeting with the doctor or the health sector, we would like to continue this ECQ. But we just need to be aware of what we are doing in our country. If you are ready to make an economic scene, also impacts to health. We will not be able to do this in our situation if you are ready to make an address. This ECQ classification is not different from the ECQ. Although we have opened some of the sectors because of people who are working so that they can have some form of income. So this is what we are waiting for. The basic thing here would be and critical would be the safe guards. Even if the ECQ is there, even if the measures are still there, we will step up and double time so that we can be able to arrest the situation. But on that note, under Secretary Berhira."
UK scientists find new data on efficacy of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine | WNT,ABC News,2021-02-03,0NONVAImTQU,"We turn out of the coronavirus here in the U.S. and news this evening on yet another potential vaccine tonight. This one from AstraZeneca. So what's different about it? Could it not only help protect you, but could it also at some point help stop transmission of the virus? What Dr. Anthony Fauci is saying about that tonight? And here's ABC's Eva Pilgrim now. Tonight, promising vaccine news. UK scientists finding the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine likely not only protects people from the virus, but also has the potential to reduce transmission. Now that is really good news. It's very positive because we know that vaccines the way out of this. Oxford's early data, not yet peer reviewed, revealing a single vaccine dose was 76 percent effective at protecting against the virus for up to three months. That protection increasing to 82 percent with a second shot given after a new longer 12 week interval. The study also suggesting that the vaccine can reduce the spread of COVID by as much as 67 percent after one dose, suggesting those vaccinated are unlikely to infect others. Today, the White House cautiously optimistic. I haven't seen the data yet. If that's true, that's good news. You know, yet again, another vaccine candidate in the mix, but reminding Americans that the current vaccines in the US allow for a gap between doses of 21 days for Pfizer or 28 days for Moderna. If you miss it by a few days to a week or two, I don't think that's a big problem as the CDC says, but I'd be concerned about the laying it for three months or so. In New York, a race to get back on track after that nor Easter, the Javits Center increasing the number of appointments to 2200 today to get ahead of a backlog. You said you felt a sense of urgency to get the vaccine. I couldn't wait to get the vaccine. I've been trying so hard not to get this disease. It's terrible. But those more contagious variants still top of mind for health experts here. I'm not an alarmist, but this is as scared as I have been since the beginning of the pandemic earlier this week. We introduced you to 35 year old AJ Jackson in Alabama. He had the UK variant. He hadn't traveled Tuesday night. The father of two passed away. It was very hard to come to terms with it, but I had to go and tell her, you know, Danny became angel just like, ready because she immediately hit the floor and started flying. It was just over there. And a new study found that adults between the ages of 20 and 49 were more than 70 percent responsible for the spread in the virus in the US last year. David or even pilgrim with us again tonight."
Philippine FDA OKs resumption of AstraZeneca vaccine use | ANC,ANC 24/7,2021-04-15,wwUYb4304PE,"The benefit outweighs the known and potential risks of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccines. This was the statement of Food and Drug Administration's Director General Eric Domingo after his agency urged the Department of Health to resume the use of the British-made jobs in the Philippines inoculation program. The announcement comes a week after the FDA limited the use of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccines to the elderly, after reports that the jobs allegedly triggered blood clots and several vaccines in Europe. Mark has become the first country to permanently halt the use of AstraZeneca's CHAP. For over a month, vaccination programs have been ongoing in various cities in Metro Manila, considered as the epicenter of COVID-19 in the Philippines. In Valenzuela and in Nevada's vaccine confidence among residents allegedly improved recently. In case of COVID-19, the city has suspended the program for those set to receive the first dose of the vaccine, as the Manila government waits for the arrival of more supply. As of April 14, at least 1.2 million doses of Sinovac and AstraZeneca jobs have been administered to Filipinos in the country. Malikanyang says more COVID-19 vaccines will arrive in the country within the month. The Department of Science and Technology says it is looking into six companies that are interested in opening vaccine manufacturing facilities in the Philippines to secure the supply of these health commodities. But we are seeing that there are many companies that are interested in opening vaccine manufacturing facilities. If they pursue what we think are their plans, based on what they have told us, it seems that the vaccine will be produced by late 2022. The DOSD says the government is willing to give these firms half-decade income tax holiday to entice more investors to open vaccine factories in the country. The government's priorities, sometimes they change depending on the administration. The private sector, as long as there is a market, and they have the capability, they are going to be sustainable. Under Secretary DeWena Guevara says companies that will secure permits to open vaccine factories in the Philippines may be announced in the coming months. Katrina Domingo, ABIAS TV News."
COVID Vaccine Can Cause Very Rare Side Effect: AstraZeneca | CNBC TV18,CNBC-TV18,2024-04-30,JvcVIfbk3ow,"And AstraZeneca has told a British court that its COVID vaccine can cause a rare side effect, which can lead to blood clots and low platelet count. The company is currently facing a barrage of class action suits in the UK. AstraZeneca vaccine was branded as Kovie Shield in India and manufactured by CEREM Institute. Ekta Bhattra joins us now with the details. Ekta, what is the company said? British Swedish farmer company AstraZeneca has admitted in court documents that its COVID-19 vaccine, developed along with the University of Oxford, can cause a rare side effect TTS or thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. AstraZeneca told the court, and I quote, it is admitted that the AstraZeneca vaccine can in very rare cases cause TTS. The causal mechanism is not known. End of quote, TTS is a very rare syndrome characterized by blood clots and low platelet counts. The admission is a part of a lawsuit filed in the UK where Jamie Scott, a father of two, alleged that AstraZeneca's vaccine, which he took in April 2021 resulted in him developing a blood clot and lead in the brain leading him with severe brain impairment. The vaccine has been shrouded with controversy on possible side effects in the past few years. For example, in March 2021, more than a dozen European countries stopped using AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine over fears of being linked to blood clots. Currently, there are 51 cases filed against AstraZeneca and the UK on allegations of the side effects of the vaccine. It is important to note that in June 2022, the World Health Organization said, and I quote, a very rare adverse event called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, TTS involving unusual and severe blood clotting events associated with low platelet counts has been reported after vaccination with this vaccine. AstraZeneca in countries with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the benefit of vaccination and protecting against COVID-19 far outweigh the risks end of quote. When it comes to India, vaccine manufacturer's Syrim Institute of India produced AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine. Remember, COVID-19 is a part of the biotech with two most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines in the country. Overwhelming majority of the population received COVID-19 as compared to COVID-19."
UK insists AstraZeneca vaccine is effective against South African variant of Covid - BBC News,BBC News,2021-02-08,vuHGfEW4_sA,"There's been a concerted effort today by government and by scientific advisers to reassure people about the efficacy of the vaccines being used in the UK. It follows growing concern about the performance of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine specifically in the context of the South African variant of the virus. Boris Johnson said he was very confident that the current vaccines delivered a high degree of protection against serious illness. And Professor Jonathan Van Tam, whose England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, said it was unlikely in his view that the South African variant would become dominant here in the short term. Now tonight in England people age 70 or older who haven't yet been called for their vaccination are being asked to contact the NHS to book an appointment. Our Medical Editor, Fergus Walsh, has the latest. There is huge public enthusiasm for COVID immunization. Ellen Droad, home of Leeds United Football Club, is now a mass vaccination hub. Joshua is 25 and has very severe asthma. He's been shielding at home and has only come out to have his jab. It was like being locked up in a way. It was like being kept in a cage and then having this is like getting the key to get out. Margaret's husband has been in intensive care with COVID for nearly a month. I just wish this had come earlier so my husband could have had it. Visiting a COVID testing kit supplier in Derby, the Prime Minister said vaccines are the way out of the pandemic for all of us. We're very confident in all the vaccines that we're using. And I think it's important for people to bear in mind that all of them we think are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death. That was in response to a small study in South Africa which suggested the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine offered only limited protection against mild to moderate infection from the main variant there. 147 cases of the South African variant have been detected in the UK and people in several areas like Worcester are being tested in a bid to prevent it spreading further. Do you think it will be possible to keep the South African variant largely suppressed in the UK? The early modeling data do not suggest a transmissibility advantage for this virus. And because of that there is no reason to think the South African variant will catch up or overtake our current virus in the next few months. And that's good news because vaccines are highly effective at protecting against the Kent variant which is dominant here. My advice to you is very simple do not delay have the vaccine that will protect you against the current threat and don't worry you can be re-vaccinated. Anyone over 70 in England who's not yet had their vaccine is being asked to contact the NHS online or by calling 119 as the UK looks well on track to have given around 15 million people in the highest risk groups their first dose by the middle of February. Focus Watch BBC News. As we've been reporting new vaccines are already in development to protect against the new South African variant of coronavirus, the next phase of the pandemic could increasingly become a game of catch up as more new variants emerge and new vaccines are developed to tackle them. Our science editor David Shookman considers what might lie ahead. Around the world there's now a race between the virus and the vaccines, between the threat of new variants and efforts to stay ahead of them and the outcome matters to us all. While a first wave of countries including the UK should see the majority of their populations vaccinated this year others won't reach that stage till next year and many will have to wait for the year after or even longer. This is a global virus, it's a global pandemic until we're all protected then it could be that a variant in another country mutates so that the current vaccines are no longer effective and that will come back so even those people who are vaccinated they are still going to be at risk of these future variants. The virus is changing all the time and when it infects human cells it takes over and gets them to make millions of copies but they won't all be the same. Each batch may have some random genetic mistakes, mutations that are usually unimportant but a few might prove dangerous. So the first task is to track these changes and that's done by studying the genetic code of the virus. Since December 2019 when it was first confirmed in Wuhan scientists have monitored what's effectively a family tree with hundreds of different branches. Each of these lines represents one of the many different variants that's emerged over the course of the past year and it's only by doing this genetic research that we can spot the variants that are worrying in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. Half a million British coronavirus samples have gone through genetic screening so far. These machines are among those that have done most of the analysis but few countries can work on this almost industrial scale so there's a lot we don't know about how the virus is changing worldwide. There are thousands of millions of cases globally, there are undoubtedly other variants of COVID that are spreading quickly but which is blind to and any one of those additional strains around the world could confer an advantage for the virus, allow it to reinfect people even though they've been vaccinated and that's what we want to protect against. One answer is to have a global screening operation. In West Africa five years ago mobile labs studied the Ebola virus, something far larger is needed now and alongside that the faster the vaccines can be rolled out and adapted as new variants emerge the safer will all be. David Shukman, BBC News. Time to look at the latest government figures now then they showed there were 14,104 new infections recorded in the latest 24-hour period. That means an average of 17,714 new cases per day in the past week across the UK 29,326 people are in hospital right now with coronavirus. Another 333 deaths were reported that's people who died within 28 days of a positive COVID test. On average in the past week 891 deaths were announced every day and the total number of UK deaths is now 112,798. Let me give you the latest on the vaccination programme. 278,988 people had a first dose of one of the three approved vaccines in the latest 24-hour period and that takes the overall number of people who've had their first jab to 12,294,06. With that let's bring in our medical editor Fergus Walsh and I suppose Fergus I'd ask you to comment on that remarkable figure of over 12 million. The take up of the COVID vaccine here is extraordinary here. 91 percent of those over 80 have had their first dose, 95 percent of those aged 75 to 79 have had one. Now that's way above what was expected and whenever I talk to people at immunisation centres there is a genuine sense of optimism and relief that they're getting immunised. The Pfizer and the AstraZeneca vaccines are both highly effective against the dominant Kent variant here so that's why it's vital people continue to come forward. We should soon see an impact in terms of reduction in hospital numbers and deaths from the vaccination programme. The longer term goal is to offer a first dose to all those over 50 and with underlying health conditions 32 million people by May. Now there's news tonight of another new variant of concern in Manchester with extra surge testing there but we're going to have to get used to that. New variants will emerge all the time but the vaccines can be fairly easily tweaked and a bit like flu we may need a booster perhaps this order may be later."
Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine can be up to 90% effective,CNBC Television,2020-11-23,B5JcSOTwoTM,"And among that top story is late stage trials showing the AstraZeneca Oxford COVID vaccine can be up to 90 percent effective. Make Tarell joining us now with the full details. Meg, good morning. Good to see you. Good morning, guys. So another vaccine Monday here. AstraZeneca reporting results from its pooled trials from multiple countries showing that when you look at the data together, you are seeing more than 90 percent efficacy. It's a bit of a confusing result, though, because one dosing regimen showed that very high efficacy. Another showed 62 percent efficacy. So together, it's about 70.4 percent effective when you combine those two dosing regimens. Now, the difference was where you got that 90 percent number, that's when they gave a half dose on the first dose and a full one on the second one. Together, they are saying these are very positive data and they do plan to start submissions where they can around the world. Now, they also say there was a large safety database from more than 24,000 volunteers in the UK, Brazil, and South Africa with follow-ups in April. Another thing that differentiates this vaccine is it can be stored at fridge temperature, you know, 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit and distributed using existing logistics. They also have tremendous manufacturing capacity. They've made a lot of different partnerships. So this vaccine could really add to supply. We are still digging through those data and understanding exactly how the different dosing regimens led to such different efficacy results. And we'll talk with experts and bring that to you this morning. But the headline, one of these dosing regimens more than 90 percent effective, 70 percent when you put both of them together, guys, back over to you. I have so many questions for you and I realize it's early and you're just going through all of this you may not have the answers to any of this yet. But look, 90 percent efficacy, that's really great too. It doesn't compare, it doesn't match up to quite as well as we've seen with both Pfizer and with Moderna with the 95 percent efficacy. But 90 percent that's really good. 62, not so great. Do you have any idea if it had anything to do with where it took place just geographically in terms of these phase three trial results? If it was different in South Africa, if it was different in Brazil, if it was different in the UK, or if it was age groups that were different that also played into that as well, or was it simply the level of dosing? When I've seen so far in the data and these I really woke up to, they did release them overnight, but we did not find out about them on embargo in advance, which we sometimes do and gives us time to really dig through them. So from the headlines that I have had a chance to really dig into, it really does seem like a dosing difference for some reason, giving that half dose on the first dose and then a full dose on the second led to that much higher efficacy. And so it's something I really want to understand, and I've already been reaching out to vaccine experts this morning to try to get a sense for, does that line up with what would make sense about how a vaccine works and is there a good explanation for that? So we can really understand why the difference. Certainly there's a huge difference between 62 and 90, between 90 and 95, you know, that's pretty good."
EU threatens to block AstraZeneca vaccine exports,CBC News,2021-01-26,SznipzmcWhk,"Vaccine delays are affecting Canada right now, as we are reporting to you one of our top stories, but not only Canada. We're getting word of major production problems at AstraZeneca and its key manufacturing facility in Europe, which has angered the European Union. Officials there have threatened action to make sure they get the supplies they've been promised. Tessa Arsilias on that story from London for us this morning. What are the problems that AstraZeneca is experiencing, Tessa? Heather, basically the company is saying this is all because of a production, problems, production delays. Europe, the EU, is certainly not happy with the company falling short of their supply promises to the block. Now, there is no public confirmation on exactly how big that number is going to be, but it is reported to be significant. Reuters reporting that up to 60 percent cut in supply. Now, let's not forget something important here. It is the context in which this is happening. There is a lot of criticism, a lot of disappointment among citizens at the slow rollout of the vaccination program across the EU. And add to that and already decrease the supply of the Pfizer vaccine, which is mainly manufactured in Belgium. Put that all together, there's a lot of frustration and the EU is keen to show that they're doing their jobs, protecting and fighting for the rights of their citizens. Let's take a listen to the EU Commissioner for Health here. In the future, all companies producing vaccines against COVID-19 in the EU will have to provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries. The European Union will take any action required to protect its citizens and rights. That last line is strong. They're basically what they're saying is if we can't get enough vaccines that are manufactured outside of the EU like the AstraZeneca one, then we're going to have to hold and control the export of vaccines made inside the block like the Pfizer one. So this could impact the Pfizer vaccine supply into the UK. Heather? Also from AstraZeneca, interesting, Tessa, there are reports that have come up in German media that AstraZeneca's vaccine is not very effective specifically for seniors. Tell us more about the reports and what the company is saying. Interesting that this is all coming out right now. The timing is significant here as well. Indeed, there are two major German daily newspapers saying that it's only effective for over 65 at 8 percent. That efficacy at 8 percent. That's extremely low. Now AstraZeneca has come out and said this is completely incorrect. And also there's someone from the German Health Ministry. It has been reported as him saying, well, maybe somebody got their numbers mixed up. This is significant though, because in a matter of days, the European Medicines Agency is expected to give the go ahead to the AstraZeneca vaccine. In fact, today, the agency's director is going to face questions at the European Parliament. This certainly is going to be one of them, Heather, a really important one that has to be answered."
Biomanufacturing a COVID-19 vector vaccine,astrazeneca,2021-03-03,bvQRvJUE29k,"Approaches to vaccine development to prime the body's immune response to COVID-19 include using weakened viruses or viral proteins or using specific viral genetic code, either DNA or RNA directly, or creating viral vectors with specific viral genetic code. A COVID-19 Adenoviral Vector vaccine is an adenovirus vector based on a common cold that has been modified and inserted with the genetic material for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Production starts with assembly of its genetic code. The adenovirus vector is engineered from adenovirus DNA by removing essential genes to stop it being able to replicate so it can only act as a carrier and not cause disease. Adding the coronavirus spike protein DNA creates the full genetic sequence for the adenoviral vector vaccine. The genetic code is introduced into a producer cell where it is transcribed and translated to form the COVID-19 Adenoviral Vector vaccine. The human cell line is engineered to contain the missing adenovirus genes so that when the vector vaccine is introduced, it can infect the cells and use the cell machinery and missing viral genes to be able to replicate producing identical puppies. Vaccine molecules are also replicated with the division of the cells and the process continues until the right concentration is reached. The addition of a chemical lysis the cells bursting them open and the vector vaccine is harvested, ready to be further tested, filtered and purified before being filled into vials."
Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine showing effectiveness in older adults,CBS News,2020-11-19,Wv4iAlEm1KE,"There's more promising news in the race for a coronavirus vaccine. The most recent testing shows AstraZeneca's vaccine developed at Oxford University is safe and highly effective on older adults. It's now the third vaccine showing promise recently. CBS News 4 and Correspondent, Charlie Daggida, has the details. It's peer-reviewed confirmation. The vaccine produces a robust immune response in those who need protection most, especially those in their 60s and 70s. Chief Scientist Andrew Pollard. But I think the thing that's really, we're delighted by, is to see that we're seeing the same immune responses in older adults as we have in younger adults. And I don't think we really predicted that in advance, because a lot of vaccines in older adults actually perform rather less well. Even more encouraging, older age groups tolerated the vaccine better than younger volunteers too. Moderna and Pfizer's vaccines have already reported positive interim data from phase 3 trials. But their success has been a boost for Oxford's candidate too. They use a similar approach, focusing on the part of the coronavirus that attaches to human cells, the spike protein. Moderna and Pfizer's vaccines inject messenger RNA that instruct cells to make harmless versions of the protein. The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine uses a weak and common cold virus to deliver those genetic blueprints. But the goal is the same. To trick the body into mounting an immune response that will remember the coronavirus should it ever attack. Producing an immune response is one thing, but when it comes to stopping the transmission of the virus, Oxford's clinical trials may have an edge. The Oxford study has been swalding every single participant on a regular basis, possibly a weekly basis, right? So what will that tell us in terms of transmission? That will help us understand whether the vaccine is able to prevent acquisition of the virus into the nose of our participants, which could then imply the potential for interruption of transmission. If we could also interrupt transmission, then we may get to a point where enough people have vaccinated that the virus is stopped in its tracks. In the long run, the Oxford vaccine may be easier to roll out than the others because it doesn't need to be stored at deep freeze temperatures. Researchers here say there's no rush, and it may be that the vaccines roll out around the same time. For now, they're hoping to report the results of their phase three trials in the coming weeks. Charlie Daggera, CBS News, Oxford, England."
Woman dies after receiving AstraZeneca vaccine | Coronavirus | 9 News Australia,9 News Australia,2021-07-12,eEjKJi5KR88,"Good evening and totally woman has died in what's believed to be South Australia's first case of fatal blood clotting caused by the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine. Georgia Westgarth is at the Royal Adelaide Hospital tonight. Georgia doctors there tried in vain to save her life. That's right, Brendan, but tragically the 72-year-old died in the intensive care unit here at the Royal Adelaide Hospital last night. She was from regional South Australia and she got the AstraZeneca Jav on June 24. It was soon after that that she began developing symptoms of blood clotting. She became so unwell she was brought here to the Royal Adelaide on Monday where she died overnight. She was in the age bracket considered to be safer from the risk of blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. But as a result of other deaths across Australia and the world, anyone under 60 here in Australia has been advised to opt for the other alternative Pfizer and those who do receive the AstraZeneca dose are being assured the blood clots, also known as TTS are extremely rare. We do know that TTS is a treatable condition and with early treatment we can try and prevent any long-term serious outcomes. Our thoughts are with her family at this very sad time. Her death has of course been referred to the TGA as well as to the coroner for further investigation. Brendan, the AstraZeneca vaccine is right now the only option available to the majority of older South Australians. Local authorities are ramping up their controls on people entering SA from Sydney with new restrictions taking effect within hours. The changes follow revelations that two Sydney removalists infected with the deadly Delta variant have been working in South Australia in recent days. There are allow to move across state borders and have kept the country running during the pandemic but essential workers have unintentionally brought COVID from New South Wales into our state. We can see the consequences of this variant in New South Wales at the moment. We don't want a lockdown in South Australia. Two infected removalists from New South Wales entered South Australia last Friday from Victoria. For five hours the crew of three unpacked furniture, unmasked and a McLaren Vale property potentially exposing a family of four. They then returned across the border where the pair has since tested positive to the Delta strain of COVID. All the information we have so far as these individuals were in South Australia for a very short period of time. No overnight stays. Sydney's COVID outbreak getting worse 112 new cases overnight at least 34 people were infectious in the community. Premier Gladys Berrajickley and says it's almost impossible that the state's lockdown will lift on Friday as planned. Our Premier taking no chances on arrivals from the harbour city. We want to seriously turn that tap off which means even stricter controls on arrivals from midnight tonight. Returning residents will only be let into South Australia with an exemption from health officials. We'd need to take this action otherwise we would need to put significantly higher level restrictions internally in South Australia. I'm hopeful that if we suppress that movement between our state and New South Wales that we won't have to take that step. While there be no change yet to the border bubble allowing free movement between SA and Broken Hill. The good news is the family who is in contact with the infected removalists have now tested negative twice to COVID. As they are relocating from New South Wales they are also in self-isolation with significantly limits the risk to the greater community. South Australia's SA Health says no extra exposure sites have yet been found on our state linked to the removal of activities while they were here."
"Doctor on new AstraZeneca vaccine data, media coverage of pandemic",CBS News,2021-03-25,BJcQbKJOEpI,"The Biden administration is ramping up nationwide vaccine efforts to help more Americans access COVID shots. The White House says it will invest $10 billion to help people find and receive vaccines, especially those in hard hit communities. Of course, this comes as AstraZeneca releases new information on its vaccine after health officials slammed the company for using, quote, outdated information in their vaccine trial results. So we've learned that AstraZeneca plans to apply for emergency use authorization in the next few weeks. Let us bring in Dr. Leo Nisola. He is a menu. He is an immunotherapy scientist. We're just talking about saying immunotherapy, and her name back to back. And then I, you know, stumbled my way through it. But I am glad you're here, Dr. Nisola. So let's talk about this AstraZeneca vaccine. The latest statement from AstraZeneca says that the shot is 76 percent effective against symptomatic cases of COVID-19. So that's not a big drop from Monday's release when they said it was 79 percent effective. I mean, it's not a good look for the company, especially when there are, you know, segments of this population that are still really nervous about taking any vaccine. But it's just a few percentage points. So is it significant at all when it comes to how potent this vaccine is? Right. And I think that's an important point for us to discuss. And just going back to the fact that we are in the middle of a global pandemic, where we are trying to develop novel vaccines to cure a deadly virus or to prevent a deadly virus from becoming a bigger problem for people's health. And companies have been on a race to develop these vaccines at a speed of time, at a speed of sound. So in that sense, AstraZeneca has, with the other companies, developed a vaccine of their own and tried to prove to regulators that their vaccine is safer than effective by analyzing their own data. Now data analysis, clinical data analysis requires a tremendous amount of effort to understand the clinical signals and the potential benefits that patients may be receiving while receiving these drugs. So this takes a lot of time and trying to do this in an urgent matter in the way that we are doing that is complicated. Now, because they are also based in Europe trying to manage the global supply of their vaccine to several other countries, things can fall into the cracks. And I think the right thing to do was to actually take a pause, look at the data again and recalculate the minute that they understood that perhaps they had more information at hand, more events to calculate on the biostatistics to understand the safety and the efficacy of these vaccines. So now there is a drop, definitely insignificant, definitely great to see that they were humble enough to pause the submission process for the emergency use authorization to review their own data, to make sure that you're confident with it, to make sure that now regulators that will be analyzing this data feel also comfortable and that the population that will likely receive it feel confident in receiving as well. So I think this is a little hiccup. They've had several other hiccups through the course of the development of their own vaccine. But again, taking a pause and re-analysing your own data is the right thing to do understanding that we are trying to know about these vaccines through press releases, which is unprecedented. We usually wait until this press releases become published peer review scientific papers. Let's talk about another study doctor that found that U.S. media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic is more negative than science journals or international media. It's something that Ann Marie and I have talked about often just personally. Have you noticed something like this? And how should reporters and journalists frame the reporting around the pandemic and the vaccines going forward? I think it's very complicated because at the same time that the media has this tremendous role of informing people, especially through the course of the past last year, where the response to the coronavirus was so botched from the federal government. Now we don't have that problem anymore because I think the transparency has shown and we are confident with the team that is leading the pandemic response. But still, I do think that the press could be a little bit more optimistic. I think I feel very optimistic today. In fact, I feel better than I felt through the course of the last year and a half. I think we have a lot to look forward to. And I think also Americans have pandemic fatigue. We are all tired of this situation. We are also tired of negative news. I think there is a lot of positive news out there. There is a lot of amazing work being done. And I think if we focused on that, we would be better off. A study published in the journal Nature Medicine today shows that COVID-19 can actually infect cells in your mouth. Could this explain why some people experience symptoms in different parts of their body? That's kind of one of the kind of founding things about COVID-19, though there are some sort of standard symptoms. A lot of people have all kinds of different symptoms as well. What we know from COVID so far is that the virus actually attaches itself to the nose of Italian. Now, researchers have found that saliva contains high level of SARS-CoV-2, which will open the path for many things, not only for potential prevention and prophylaxis treatment, but also understanding this research can be turned into a new swab test to detect COVID in a less evasive manner. So now, researchers, scientists, drug makers are trying to use this new information about the availability of SARS-CoV-2 molecules in the mouth as a form of therapy or a test to cope with the virus."
How the AstraZeneca vaccine measures up,ABC News,2021-03-22,XeqBLsp9s54,"Now to the promising US trial results of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, it's not yet authorized in the US, but today the company said that their vaccine is 79 percent effective in stopping symptomatic COVID-19 and 100 percent effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalization. Here to tell us more is director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University, Dr. Adrian Hill. Now with these newly released trial results, can you walk us through how the AstraZeneca vaccine compares to those currently authorized in the US, namely Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson? So you can compare them if you're doing that head-to-head. If you're doing different trial protocols, it's quite difficult. But what all these vaccines do and do extremely well is protect against severe COVID, against hospitalization and against death from COVID. And the number we come up with there is 100 percent, which is similar to Moderna and Pfizer and other licensed vaccines. So the next question is how well does it prevent clinical COVID or more mild disease? And the estimate we're getting is 79 percent, or 80 percent in older adults. And that's a pretty good figure. It would be better if we had used a longer interval between the first and second dose, as we have shown in our program previously. But how about the temperature, for example, for Pfizer and Moderna, they do have to be kept at a certain temperature. Is that the case with AstraZeneca as well? No, ours is kept in the fridge like the vast majority of vaccines. The RNA vaccines are very unusual in that they need a freezer or even a deep freeze. And that's why this AstraZeneca vaccine is now being deployed in 101 countries I've heard today and that number is steadily increasing. So it's a very deployable vaccine. So this is more user-friendly if you would in that aspect. It's user-friendly in Europe and in the United States. It's just possible to use in some low-income countries, which do not have minus 80 freezers and really can't deploy a vaccine that needs to be frozen for a lot of the time. So yes, WHO are very keen on this vaccine because of its user-friendlyness, as you say. This latest AstraZeneca trial tested a more diverse population and also showed some promising results for adult 65 and older. Can you explain why the company took this testing approach and what was learned from it? Well, that particular approach is really stipulated by the founder. This was well-the warp speed awardees to test this vaccine. And it's good that we were able to look at diverse ethnicities. The efficacy was not different between any one group and the other. And very importantly, we were able to show that the efficacy is equally high in older adults compared to younger adults. And that's an age group that we had fewer subjects in in previous trials. By the time that this vaccine is authorized in the U.S., most Americans will probably already have been vaccinated. But we're also in, of course, this global race against the spread of COVID variants. And this has been called the vaccine for the world. What impact do you see it having in fighting the worldwide pandemic? You know, well, I would like to think that everybody will be vaccinated anywhere by the middle of the year. But even if that happens, we just don't know how long these vaccines work for. So it's totally possible that we will need to boost everybody at the end of the year to avoid another huge winter wave of disease and death. That remains to be seen. As you point out, these variants of concern are of concern, particularly the ones starting off in South Africa, but now spreading more widely. Some companies, including AstraZeneca, are working on a vaccine specifically for that South African variant in collaborating in collaboration with our group in Oxford. Right, no such thing is too much vaccine today or any time in the future."
AstraZeneca vaccine: Regulator says Oxford COVID-19 jab is safe after seven UK deaths,Sky News,2021-04-03,nbqSHwYsCWE,"Is it clear at this stage whether this is a coincidence or a side effect of the vaccine? At this stage there's no evidence to suggest a causal link between blood clotting and the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. If we look at the data shared by the MHRA, it says that by the 24th of March 18.1 million doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered in the UK and 30 of these people developed unusual blood clotting. So this is a really rare form of blood clotting and of those reported blood clots, seven have sadly died. But when put into perspective this is a really small number and it has to be weighed against the threat of catching the coronavirus and the health implications that this could have further down the line. But some countries in Europe have restricted the use of the Oxford jab for more of a precautionary measure. But the MHRA Chief Executive has stressed that the benefits of taking the vaccine actually outweigh the risks. And in a statement this is what they say. They say that the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca in preventing COVID-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so. Now the infection specialist at Imperial College London has said that looking at all the information in hands there's no real reason to be worried about taking the vaccine. Let's take a listen to what he had to say. Currently there's no link to having the vaccine and having these very rare blood clots. So if you look in the general population estimates are between two and 16 people per million may naturally get this type of blood clot and so the association with vaccination may not be related to the vaccine itself. So right now there's no reason to be worried about this vaccine. Now there are ongoing investigations surrounding the blood clotting but safety really is paramount when it comes to weighing the benefits and the risks of taking the vaccine and that's something that health regulators are really focusing on at the moments."
Doctor discusses AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine blood clot concerns,CNBC International TV,2021-04-09,LRgnLBFvKXU,"So as you know, what has happened is that the regulators in both the UK and Europe have found that of the 25 million or so people vaccinated, that around a hundred or a bit less than a hundred had these very unusual clots. They're clots that are also associated with bleeding and also with low platelets. And these are quite different to usual clots, for instance, DVDs and Pornri embolists coming from the legs. So the initial analyses were looking at all clots. And that's why a couple of weeks ago, people were saying, oh, the rate post vaccine is no different to the background rate. But actually, I think that analysis was was probably flawed. And now they've looked at these very specific clots and found that they probably do occur in about four per million. And about one of those four people will die. So the messaging needs to be very clear here that this is like a one in 250,000 chance and a one in a million chance of dying. And we're not doing this for no reason. We're doing it because COVID is an extremely dangerous disease with a much higher death rate, obviously, than one in a million. So I understand why people might be a bit reticent, but it really could be similar to driving your car. What are the odds of having a serious car accident? They're going to be in the order of one in hundreds of thousands or getting hit by lightning. And the thing is, you have to get on with your life and the vaccine is the way to return us to life as we know. Right, Professor, my follow-up then would be that you think this is a misstep. This is an overreaction from local governments to say, let's pause because we had some countries in ASEAN also take that stand earlier on, earlier this month when reports of blood clots emerged. I think we have to be honest with the community where the rule number one in in rolling out vaccines is that there has to be a lot of trust. So if something is found and there is a link, then we're really under an obligation to share that information. But equally, we have to to couch it in the way which offers the right perspective. I don't think it's an overreaction. The UK has come up with a very nice algorithm where realizing that most of these unusual clots and bleeds occur particularly in young women, then actually they're limiting the vaccination to exclude young women. And that's taking into account all the different effects. The likelihood of them getting very sick from COVID, the likelihood of them getting a problem with the vaccine. It is okay to nuance this a bit. The risk that I quoted before is even less in older men for instance. But I must say the other thing they noticed was that they virtually always occur in the first couple of weeks. So if you had a couple of weeks ago, you can relax. But really, I think it's not an overreaction. It's just honesty."
Vaccine claim: 'We need to learn from these incidents' says former NHS leader,Sky News,2024-04-29,z3au89mNWb8,"Let's get some more with GP Dr Nikita Kanani who joins me now. She's also the former medical director of primary care for NHS England. Dr Kanani, really good to see you here on the UK tonight. As pointed out in Thomas's report there, the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine was helpful for so many people, but 51 cases have now been lodged in the high court with victims and grieving relatives seeking damages estimated to be worth up to 100 million pounds. Families are concerned. But the key word here is that these serious side effects are rare. Yeah, absolutely. Good evening, Sarah Jane, and thanks for having me. First of all, the story that we just heard, Jamie and his family, I mean, what a truly difficult time that they've had in the other complainants. I mean, it's a really challenging space to be in when, as we heard on the programme, you're asked to take a vaccination to protect yourself. And to protect your loved ones. But that is very much where we were if we can take ourselves back to the end of December 2020 in the beginning of 2021. We were still very much locked down in our own homes with no real possibility of getting back to doing the things that we loved as families, as communities in the workplace. So, you know, importantly, vaccines did offer us hope, and they continue to offer us hope. Our ability to get people vaccinated as quickly and safely as possible meant that the country could reopen. It meant that we could get back to seeing people that we loved in the way that many of us had missed. But equally, as Thomas mentioned, the ability for vaccination to offer a sort of social pact or social contract is important. Trust in vaccines is incredibly important. And these side effects are very rare, as you say. So, there's an important message here, you know, continuing to get vaccinated when asked to do so is important. But learning from vaccinations and vaccination programmes is also critically important too. It's about finding a cause or link, isn't it? And of course, this is an ongoing court case. Jamie Scott is claiming that the vaccine gave him these side effects. That hasn't been proven. AstraZeneca are strongly denying. But how easy is it to find a cause or link in a vaccine for an extreme side effect? Because, you know, is the risk any greater with a COVID vaccine than it is any other vaccine you may take for a nearness or a disease? It's a really good question, Sir, Jane. I mean, all vaccine and, in fact, all therapies are monitored very closely. There's a yellow-card system in this country where if somebody does get a potential side effect from a medication or a vaccination, or really any other intervention, the clinician fills out a form and those side effects are followed up and that data is then looked into and researched. Obviously, some of the COVID vaccinations are newer in the sense that they were newer to the population. But there was a huge amount of research done and testing done before the vaccinations were rolled out. So, what we have to do now is to make sure that we really do learn from these incidents, understand what's been happening and make sure it informs how we roll out programs in the future as well. So, what would you say to families who are concerned watching Tommas' report this evening? I think, first of all, we've seen that the very vast majority of vaccinations have been truly incredibly well received. This was the reason that we're back to doing the things that we love in a way that I don't think many of us imagined in 2020. So, the vast majority of vaccinations are completely safe and if you're being called forward for a vaccination, no matter what age you are, what stage of life, please do come forward. You can always speak to healthcare professional if you're worried, but the most important thing is to maintain our immunity. And that goes for many of the vaccinations that we have and that we do for our children when they're growing up as well. We saw a peak in the number of children having measles and mumps last year. We don't want to see that again, so it's really important that vaccinations are taken up when they're offered."
Oxford AstraZeneca Vaccine: The Five Big Problems | London Ground Report,CRUX,2021-02-06,F_wbtosQhic,"The Oxford vaccine appeared the biggest promise after the pandemic broke out last year. Today, none is more controversial or appears less convincing. The vaccines are reporting about 90 percent success. The Oxford trial showed a 62 percent success rate in the trial that went as intended, which meant a 2-5 chance that you can take the vaccine and still get the virus, though it is claimed that the infection would be less acute. The Oxford team did suggest up to 90 percent success, but that suggestion arose from results with no more than three individuals through the course of the clinical trial, who were given a smaller dose of the vaccine than was planned. Oxford then averaged these results out. 62 percent here, 90 percent there, who suggests 70 percent efficacy. This kind of averaging was rejected by most, and more significantly, it was rejected by the MSRA, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority of Britain, whose job it is to approve vaccines. The Oxford vaccine was approved, but not on the base of that 90 percent claim. For a start, just what was Oxford doing making a mistake over simple dosage in a trial such as this, and when has a trial mattered more, and then to throw out the suggestion and no more on the basis of results with three individuals that perhaps if you give people less vaccine, it may work better. This surely is far from scientific. And now a huge ethical issue has arisen over the trials. Oxford did not tell many of its volunteers that they had been given a certain dosage incorrectly. It is now half-hinting that all this may have been part of the plan, but it does not spell this out clearly. It suggests this in blurry language intended clearly to cover up rather than come clean a long way from transparency. Not least, Oxford simply did not test the most vulnerable. Most of its volunteers in the clinical trials were 18 to 55 years of age, including those three individuals with whom 90 percent success has been claimed. That's an age group where most people recover naturally. And now, France and Germany are refusing to hand out this AstraZeneca vaccine to the elderly to anyone above 65 years of age, on the grounds that it has never been tested on the elderly, who of course needed most. This week, the under-fresh Oxford team held out two new promises. One, while offering some protection and reducing the severity of any infection, it also cuts down France's messibility by about two-thirds. And that difference is important. A vaccinated person may be protected, but still be a carrier. The lungs may be protected from the virus, but it may persist in the upper respiratory tract. Second, that it is now developing an updated version of the vaccine, two guard against new variants of the virus. We have this in place later this year. We are watching that space now, but perhaps with more caution than conviction."
"Denmark, Norway, Iceland halt use of AstraZeneca's vaccine",Reuters,2021-03-11,X4K7gwCiBng,"Health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland suspended the use of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine shots on Thursday following reports of the formation of blood clots in some people who had received the vaccine. The announcement comes after Austria stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary embolism. Still, the EU's medicine regulator said the vaccine's benefits outweighed the risks and could continue to be administered. Denmark suspended the AstraZeneca shots for two weeks after a 60-year-old woman who was given a shot from the same batch used in Austria formed a blood clot and died. Denmark said the suspension was also prompted by reports quote of possible serious side effects from other European countries. Some health experts said there was little evidence to suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine should not be administered. One expert told Reuters it's extremely difficult to distinguish a causal effect from a coincidence. AstraZeneca told Reuters in a written statement that the safety of its vaccine had been extensively studied in human trials and peer-reviewed data confirmed it was generally well tolerated. The drug-maker said this week there had been quote no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine. It also said it was in contact with Austrian authorities about the death and would fully support their investigation."
Why doctors are concerned about the Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine,CNBC Television,2020-08-24,rH3BxK66j5w,"The Trump administration is reportedly considering fast-tracking the vaccine being developed by Oxford University in AstraZeneca for use in the U.S. ahead of the presidential election. This after the FDA granted emergency authorization used to convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 patients. For more, let's bring in Matt Harper of stat news. Matt, thank you for joining us. Just first on the treatment news, the convalescent plasma. What's the reaction from the medical experts, the doctors that you guys talk to? How big of a deal is this and does it expand coverage? It's not clear how much it expands coverage. It does expand coverage some. The convalescent plasma was actually available in the study that generated this data, which is called an expanded access program. A 35,000 people in that study. The question is, there's a lot of people are still very unsure whether or not there's evidence that it is effective. I guess if you're a patient that's hospitalized with COVID-19 or got for bin in the ICU, you want anything that could possibly work. And if there's enough evidence to show that this does, why not go ahead with this emergency use authorization? We need more of this, don't we? Experience with hydroxychloroquine is a good reason to be careful about that. Whatever you think about hydroxychloroquine, in the indication we used it, in patients who were in the hospital, there are now several trials showing that there was no benefit and there may have been harm. So that's not always true. As Robert Caleb, the former FDA commissioner, likes to say that in a lot of, if you put all the studies that have been run and anything together, you might be better off getting placebo than drug. It's not always true that something is better than nothing. You know Matt, it's Brian, Selvin, listen, we've heard that a vaccine may be only 40 to 50 percent effective and maybe only 40, 50 percent of the people will take it or be able to get it. That's not optimistic long term. We're going to kind of have to power our way through this. Is there any indication, and I'm referencing a study from Germany about two months ago, that we are seeing T-cell and antibody response naturally in human beings just by having some small viral load or a small exposure to the coronavirus. Is there any indication that we are self-humanizing at all? I don't understand why you go for self immunization over vaccines. Look, there are a lot of vaccines in development. There's a tendency of the market end of people watching to focus on one. But really, the, I see you have them up there, Moderna Fies or Johnson and Johnson and Sonofi, AstraZeneca, Novavax. And then there are more after that. I wouldn't bet on the, the way the FDA has set the bars if a vaccine has proved itself to be better than 30 percent efficacy, which gets you to about, it'll be showing 50 percent efficacy, but you know it's better than 30 percent. That's what they've said they will approve. That's going to be better than that immunity that you're talking about. What about this Financial Times report, Matt, that the U.S., that the Trump administration is looking at fast-tracking the vaccine? What is your reporting show? As people do wonder if corners are being cut from a safety perspective with political pressure around the election to get this vaccine out? There are two separate things. I've heard from a lot of doctors who are very worried that corners will be cut. On the other hand, just saying that you're going to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine based on the earlier studies that are already ongoing doesn't mean that, could mean that those studies turn out really well. There's the one in the UK, the problem there is there's not a lot of coronavirus. There's the one in Brazil where there's a lot of coronavirus, but the study's smaller. It's possible that there will be data from those studies that could warn at least some expanded access, which it doesn't have to be for everybody. But really, the question is whether the FDA gets an opportunity to weigh that evidence properly and to abide by the standard story set. Matt, I want to go back to your previous point where I asked you about natural immunity. I'm a little bit confused by your comment because the reality is if half the country can't get it or won't take it and it's only 30 to 50 percent effective, we look at 1968, the forgotten pandemic, twice as deadly to those under 65 as COVID so far has been. It still exists in some form today and there's been some talk that maybe we're a little more resistant against COVID because of these prior influenza, even though I understand this is different than just the flu. Why would why would a vaccine be better than us doing what we have done over centuries? That's why we have vaccines. All the vaccines we use, a lot of them are the immunity from a vaccine can be better than the immunity you mount yourself. HPVs are really an example there. So I wouldn't have and in order to get the immunity from other coronaviruses, T cells and killer T cells, those are things that some of the vaccines are hoping they're going to generate. That's one of the ideas behind the astrosanica vaccine. Pfizer has been hopeful about their T cell data. Antibodies are the main thing that people looking at that they're hoping will be a correlative immunity as they are with flu shots. But it's a lot to hope. It's one thing to hope that that immunity existence is going to kick in is going to help us and gosh I do and I don't know. But vaccines are, I wouldn't assume that that would be the same thing as a vaccine which is why we're in such a hurry to develop one."
UK approves Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,ABC News,2020-12-30,sgJA1ynox8U,"But we do have some good news in the pandemic as well. The UK has approved another vaccine. This one from Oxford and AstraZeneca, ABC News Foreign Correspondent James Longman is in London tracking the latest there. James, good morning. It's nice to be talking to you about a little bit of good news for once. What do we know about this new AstraZeneca vaccine? And how could the differences between that vaccine and some of the others now approved make such a difference in the vaccine strategy? Hi, Diane. Yeah, great to speak to you and great to have some good news. And it is significant. You know, the differences are quite significant between this vaccine and the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine. Mainly on temperature and on cost. The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine doesn't need to be kept at those super low temperatures. It just can be kept in a regular refrigerator like mine or yours, which means it's much, much easier to roll out. Officials here are hoping that a lot more people will be able to get this vaccine a lot quicker. And on cost, it is significantly cheaper. The Pfizer vaccine per dose costs around $20. The Moderna vaccine will cost something around $30. This one just between $2 and $3, which means this vaccine is now much more accessible for billions of people around the world. Oxford and AstraZeneca made an agreement when they started out on this thing that it wouldn't be gobbled up by developed nations like ours and like yours. And that is indeed what happened with the Pfizer vaccine on pre-orders. This one, one billion doses have already been pre-ordered by low and middle income nations. So it makes it a lot more accessible for them. And on strategy, well, another big line out of the UK here today is that Britain has changed its vaccine rollout strategy. Originally, you'd have the first dose and then you'd wait three weeks for your second dose. We saw Margaret Keenan, the 91-year-old of the North of England, the first person on Earth to get vaccinated outside of a trial. She's now had her second dose, big smiles from her again today. But that now will change in Britain. The authorities here want to vaccinate as many people as possible with the first dose and delay that second one for up to three months on both the Pfizer and the Oxford vaccine in order just to get as many people protected as possible. They saw out of the Oxford trials that even after one dose of the vaccine, if you waited three weeks, you would not go into the hospital with the coronavirus. Now, it won't stop you from getting it entirely, but it'll stop you from needing to be hospitalized. And that's the big issue here, protecting health services. We're seeing them overwhelmed here in London. Hospitals are filling up. You're seeing it over there in the United States. I think people realize they can't stamp out coronavirus altogether, but just one dose of this thing can keep people out of the hospital and that is the aim. So a little bit of good news on what is otherwise a pretty bleak time here. Yeah, we've heard a lot of conversation about changing the strategy to that. Instead using that one dose for as many people as possible, be interesting to see if the US also follows suit there. Unfortunately, though, here in the US, we now have our first detected case of that new strain that we originally saw in the UK. We know it's been there in the UK for a while now. So how are officials treating that variant and what do you think US officials can learn from that? Well, fundamentally, I think officials here understand that to treat or to combat this variant or indeed any other variant of coronavirus, we know there are at least seven strange circulating around the world. The same restrictions need to be put in place. You need to keep the distance from people. You need to wear a mask, you need to wash your hands. I don't think that anything major can be done really, you know, differently than was done ordinarily. And I think that's the major takeaway for the United States. We in Britain and in Europe, we have far harsher restrictions in place. And yet this variant is circulating wildly in the population. So if it comes over to the United States, a place where we're watching from abroad doesn't seem to have many rules in place in much of the country or at least people aren't necessarily taking them very seriously, the variant and any other new variant in the future could spread a lot. I mean, this one was tracked back to September, where they found the original patient had it. It takes about a month to sequence the genome. They realized in October that it was a new variant. It didn't, it was December before the government changed tack on canceling Christmas. You remember, we actually were going to relax restrictions for Christmas. They changed tack at the last minute. So I think maybe you've only found a few cases of the variant over there in the United States to completely close down might be something officials in the United States consider, because in Britain now, restrictions are really ramping up. We cancel Christmas. It's likely that New Year is basically off as well. The only things that remain open in Britain at the moment, really in most of this country are schools, but there will be an announcement later today that they may even close as well. So I think it's very clear that this variant is very transmissible. It's not more deadly. It's important to say that. But in London alone, 62 percent of new cases are from this variant of coronavirus. So it does seem to be replacing the old variant, if you like. And so that is the warning from here in Britain. But as ever, throughout these last few months, Diane, no country seems to want to learn from another. And we all go our own ways. So fingers crossed for 2021. Fingers crossed, indeed. Yet another reason why it's so urgent that we get that vaccine to as many people as possible. James Longman in London. Thanks as always, James, stay safe. Hi, everyone. George Stephanopoulos here.

EU regulator declares AstraZeneca vaccine “safe and effective” - BBC News,BBC News,2021-03-18,V195674qUcA,"Most of the European countries that suspended the use of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine have said they will start using it again. After the EU's medical regulator declared it safe and effective, Italy, Germany, France and Spain are among those resuming use of the jab after a pause over fears of a link to blood clots in a small number of people. Here, the UK's regulator said any link between the jab and clots is unproven and the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh any risks. Here's our medical editor, Fergus Walsh. Every injection, every vaccine given is another person protected. Half a million people a day here are getting immunised at present. Many EU countries suspended using the Oxford AstraZeneca jab pending the outcome of today's safety review, in hull there was no sign of vaccine hesitancy. We're in a long time, I'm like, I'm in my 60s so I've only just really got myself just happy it's finally done. I just took on board, this is my point man, this is what needs doing, this is keeping everyone safe so let's go ahead and get it done. The UK medicine's regulator said after a rigorous review there was no evidence that blood clots were caused by the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. It looked in particular at five cases of rare clots in the brain among 11 million people immunised by the NHS. All were men under 60, one of whom died. It said given the link was unproven, the benefits of the vaccine far outweighed potential side effects. For those in their 40s, the risk of dying after Covid infection is one in a thousand. As a precautionary measure, it's advising anyone with a headache that last more than four days after vaccination to seek medical attention. There is no difference that blood clots in veins are occurring more than would be expected in the absence of vaccination for either vaccine. The public can have every confidence in the thoroughness of our review. And in Amsterdam, the European medicine agency has come to the same conclusion about the AstraZeneca jab. This is a safe and effective vaccine. It benefits in protecting people from Covid-19 with the associated risks of death and hospitalisation outweighed the possible risks. The committee also concluded that the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of thrombobolic events or blood clots. The Prime Minister, who is 56, will get his first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine tomorrow and said all adults would be offered a jab by the end of July. Our progress along the road to freedom continues unchecked. We remain on track to reclaim the things we love to see our families and friends again to return to our local pubs, our gyms and sports facilities and of course our shops. All, of course, as long as the data continue to go in the right direction and we meet our foretests. Those in their 40s seem likely to have to wait until May to get their first vaccine because older people will be getting their second shot and there won't be enough extra doses to go around due to supply issues caused by a delay in a delivery of vaccine from India and a batch here that needed retesting. Half of all adults in the UK have now had a first dose of vaccine. The head of the NHS in England, Sir Simon Stevens, got the AstraZeneca jab at Westminster Abbey. Safe and effective vaccines will answer all our prayers to be delivered from this pandemic. Fergus Horses, BBC News. Well our European Secretary of State Adela is in Brussels now. Safe and effective is the verdict. Is this going to be enough to restore confidence in the EU? Well so if you let me explain why that is such an important question because here in mainland Europe a Covid infections are again on the rise. If you have a look at parts of central and eastern Europe you have some of the highest death rates now in the whole world and today France joined Germany and Italy that recently said that they are facing a third wave so the EU desperately needs to vaccinate people but it faces two big problems. Number one is supply that EU simply doesn't have enough vaccines at the moment and the second big problem is public acceptance because many European Sophie are more vaccine wary than they count apart in the UK and EU leaders on again off-again relationship with the AstraZeneca jab really hasn't helped matters. I mean remember back in January when some EU leaders were suggesting it might not be as effective in the over 65s then they'd changed their minds. Now they were the worries about blood clots and so a lot of people have been put off angular Merkel admitted that the jab has what she called an acceptance problem in Germany and in France the Prime Minister said he would be getting the AstraZeneca jab in order to try and boost public confidence but critics of how the EU has handled all this say it could be too late a lot of damage has already been done. Katia thank you and let's talk now to our political editor Laura Kinsbak in Westminster and concerns today about supplies of the jab here. Well that's right Sophie after all the squall over the vaccine over safety and also over supplies we learned yesterday there's a real slowdown the amount there be arriving into the UK I think the Prime Minister himself felt that he had to get out there front up to the concerns because I think there was a bit of a worry a bit of a niggle inside government that there might be some little hints about public confidence not being where it should be and it has in this country by comparison with others in the European Union being sky high. So the Prime Minister was out there saying reassurance on number one it's safety boasting of his own vaccine tomorrow and he'll be rolling up his own sleeves. Secondly on supply that although there has been a bit of a slowdown and the government won't be able to speed ahead with their plan they will absolutely be able to stick to their targets by giving everybody over 18 their first dose by the end of July and lastly he also was determined to reassure on the bigger question the vaccines roll in the gradual opening of the country's doors and he was adamant he said several times that for now we would be sticking to the so-called road map moving cautiously and carefully through different stages but the vaccine is such a vital part of that you could see today the government's absolutely adamant they do not want the public's faith in the program to be dented."
AstraZeneca vaccine: What impact will the policy change have? - BBC Newsnight,BBC News,2021-04-07,T72yVU7K94c,"Young people aged 18 to 29 without health conditions are some of those least likely to be directly affected by serious illness caused by COVID, which is why today the advice about what vaccine they should be offered changed. Over the past few weeks we've heard concerns about certain types of blood clots associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine which has already been used on millions. And today both the European and UK medicines regulators said the evidence that it may be a vaccine side effect is getting stronger. But they stressed overall the benefits are way the harms. So what's happening to people who do develop blood clots after the AstraZeneca vaccine. It may have something to do with platelets, tiny particles that help blood to clot. So what we're seeing is that patients have blood clots with low platelets and they have low platelets because they have developed an antibody against their platelets. And they are activating them so the platelets are all going yippy and forming clots everywhere in a very aggressive way. The overall numbers are extremely small and COVID itself can cause blood clots at a much higher rate than those associated with the vaccine. But today the Deputy Chief Medical Officer said the under 30s would be offered a different vaccine to the AstraZeneca one where available. The NHS has a message that we will get the right vaccine to you in the right time according to the new JCVI advice. There might be a small delay sometimes. There might be a slightly greater distance that some people are asked to travel. But the NHS is all over this and understands the challenge. Vaccines continue to be the way out for the UK. They continue to be the way in which we can get our lives back to normal. In medicine clinicians balance benefits against the harms. These may be marginal for a person under 30. Their risk of serious illness from COVID needing intensive care admission is lower than in other age groups. But some UK regulatory data suggests they seem to have a slightly higher risk of blood clots. These are early data and evidence is still accumulating as it is for all COVID vaccines. So there is some uncertainty. According to the analysis benefits of the vaccine increase when the virus rate is higher. But data is still coming in. It's early days. While attention has focused on AstraZeneca, experts will be looking to the vaccines. The European regulator is looking at those using a similar technology. The honest truth is we have no idea at this point what the mechanism is. And we therefore have to be completely open minded about the possibility that we might see this or other signals with other vaccines as they come through. Most of these vaccines are entirely novel platforms. They have never been used in humans before. Symptoms for these rare blood clots occur four or more days after vaccination and include severe headache, blurred vision, shortness of breath. Unusual bruising. It's not yet clear what the risk factors are, but that our treatment for those with these clots. Everyone will be awake to the phenomenon. And so we will get patients diagnosed very quickly. And that is keen. So if we can find patients who are thrombosis and low platelet counts, they also have slightly other changes in their blood, which also help identify the virus. And then they need to be treated as soon as possible. Today saw the launch of another new vaccine in Wales made by Moderna. Experts advising the government said the advice not to offer AstraZeneca to under 30s shouldn't slow down the UK's rollout. This policy changes quite unlikely to influence the overall rollout simply because the majority of people under the age of 30 who are in good health will not in any case be becoming eligible for vaccination for yet a while. So I think there's a reasonably good chance that the suppliers do come through as expected that this really won't disrupt things to any great extent. As vaccine programmes roll out across the world, we'll learn more and more. But after tens of millions of vaccinations so far, experts still say for adults the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the harms. Deb Cohen with that report and we're joined now by professors Stephen Reicher, a member of the spy bee committee which advises the government on ways of helping people to comply with interventions recommended by medical or epidemiological experts. Also joining us is Professor Jeremy Brown, a member of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation and Dr Margaret Harris of the World Health Organization. Professor Brown, if I can start with you perhaps from the JCVI, some countries have stopped using AstraZeneca for those under 55 for example Canada. And I think Germany has stopped them for under 60s. Sweden has put it on hold for people under 65. So why does our recommendation only affect the under 30s? Can you explain that difference that we're seeing? Well I can explain why we've decided about under 30s rather than an older age range and that's based purely on the risk benefit analysis. So if you catch COVID and you're in your age group 20 to 30, about 10 people in a million will die. If you're 30 to 40 more like 40 people will die and if you're over 40 is 120 people will die. So you can see that the risk of having a severe infection and those numbers are doubled for people in the open intensive care and triple to quadruple for those in the open hospital. So the risk of getting a severe disease very much ramp up ramps up with age. And so compared to the risk of this potential side effect associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is a few in a million, you can see that the ratio of the risk of the potential risk of the vaccine versus the risk of the disease. It's much more in favour of vaccinating people when you get above the age of 30. Is that the same answer if I asked you about the difference between men and women? Because the risk Chinese it is does appear to be more prominent in women, but they haven't made that distinction. I think it's very hard for us to know about the difference between men and women with it is a true difference because in fact in general, more women have been vaccinated because they are the hard portion of healthcare workers and social care workers and people working care homes are female rather than male. And in the younger age groups, there has been a higher portion of women that have been vaccinated. So to get a true incidence of whether it's increased in women compared to men is going to be a little bit difficult for now. And in terms of how this has rolled out, if I can go to Stephen Reichenow, are you happy to have this clarified tonight? Does this make your own role with spy B easier? I think today's announcement was very well handled. It was nice to see that it was handled by the scientists giving clear and objective information without being obscured by too much political speak. And I do think there were two really important points that we need to hammer home. I mean the first is that if today you had the AstraZeneca job, it was probably the safest thing you did. It was probably more dangerous to have a bath about 30 people drowned in the bath each year. It was certainly more dangerous walking down the stairs, a thousand people died falling down the stairs. And it was safer than having breakfast about 200 people a year choke on their food. So it's an extremely safe thing overall. What's more, if we look at the news in the round for today and put things together, then actually there is more reason to believe that you are protected by the vaccine. That you that you that you might be harmed by it. So a study came out today showing that those who've had severe COVID, one in three 33 percent have mental health problems. So overall, if you look at the balance, actually the balance is becoming clearer in favor of the vaccines. I think most of us understand the balance of risk and how that massively outweighs. But we just heard a scientist in Deb Cohen's package say it's really important that people can be awake to the phenomenon that actually once you once it's spoken its name, if anyone, tiny is that is, is is encountering symptoms and they just get diagnosed more quickly. So it's helpful round to have these things out. Would you agree with that? I think the information is absolutely critical. And when we started the vaccine rollout, in spy B, we argued that it needs to be accompanied by an information rollout of the same order. Now, I think we've done quite magnificently in terms of the rollout of the vaccine itself in terms of number of jobs that people have had. We haven't done quite so well in terms of the information rollout. So people haven't been given the information they need both about the consequences and possible consequences of the vaccines, nor about the behaviors that are necessary in order to stay safe. And I think this is a very good object, listening how important transparency is. If you fear that if you tell people negative news, it will put people off, then danger is that it comes back to haunt you later, as it indeed it is today. If you're absolutely open right from the start that the vaccines are very, very good, but we don't need to overstate them. They're not perfect. They will have side effects. There will also be adverse effects, which are which correlate if you vaccinate enough millions of people, then some pretty bad things are going to happen to people. And I think we've got to trust people more, be more transparent with information, not overstate the case. And then it doesn't come as a surprise, the sort of things that happened today. In fact, to me one of the most interesting things said today by Jonathan Van Tam was the fact that he's not at all surprised by this. He expected that some things would come out, as indeed they do as we get more data. But overall, what we're discovering is how effective the vaccines are, how safe they are, and this whole process, and with this huge process going on, because of a very few number of cases, show how seriously safety has been taken. Those are the messages we need to press home. Just before I come to Dr Harris and we'll look at the world view, I just want to pick up with Joey Brown on that question of transparency. Norway, Denmark, Iceland suspended the AZ jobs, the AstraZeneca jobs almost a month ago after their government scientists expressed their own belief in that link. Now, the time it seemed that the European countries were dismissed for that suspension. Does it seem to you now that we were too hasty to judge, and maybe that transparency earlier on would have been helpful here? Okay, so what we did not like about the suspension was the rapid suspension in an age group where the risk benefit would clearly benefit carrying on with the vaccination. So many of the countries you've mentioned that suspended the vaccine in age groups where the incidence of the disease is going up and the death rate is now like 1,000, 1,100 something approaching that order of magnitude. And by suspending the use of vaccination, they have probably led to more deaths and morbidity than illness than they would have done if they carried on with the vaccine program. That's the issue with their rapid suspension in age groups where the disease itself was, is like this course, very severe infections. Well, let me pick up with Dr Harris now. Thanks for your patience. But in terms of the rollout now, worldwide, which is clearly where the World Health Organization comes in, the beauty of AstraZeneca was that it was meant to be cost price and room temperature. Do you believe that any of what we're talking about today will affect that rollout in developing world economies? AstraZeneca remains a beautiful vaccine, a real workhorse. As the other speakers have said, the importance of this information is that the safety system, the vigilance is there and it's working because we are getting reports and we're looking at those reports looking at every one of them to understand what it means. But in terms of the rollout for us, the big issue is that the cupboard is bare. We need more doses. And has the pause from any of those European countries helped Kovax get more of the supplies to developing countries, developing economies earlier? To date, I couldn't say that that's happening. A little under two weeks ago, my director general made an appeal to countries with surpluses to donate a million of the vaccines that we can use in Kovax. That's AstraZeneca and Pfizer biotech. And to date, I have not heard of any of those vaccines arriving yet. So you mean that they haven't? I mean, is that your way of saying they haven't? To date, yes, we haven't got anything extra from the agreements that we had with the suppliers and unfortunately the supplies we thought we would have been delayed because India particularly is dealing with a massive, massive outbreak and they are using what they've got. And when we talk about a country like India, which has got a much younger population, we've been talking about age-based risk today, is the lesson not to worry about vaccinating the young at all? Or would you expect the Indian population to carry on vaccinating across the range as soon as they get the vaccination? So we at WHO have identified very much the priority groups we want to see vaccinated first. And that's the health and social care workers, the frontline workers, the people who are exposed every day, so most likely to get infected. And of course, the people in the older age groups because they're risk of severe disease and death is so much higher. And then this is the third group people with underlying disease. We see those people get very, very ill and are likely to die as well. And after that, then countries prioritize. But those groups need to be vaccinated everywhere around the world so that we do not see these high levels of disease and death. I mean, we have lost over 2.8 million people to this and some countries are recording horrendous daily death rates. And the vaccines and AstraZeneca included have been shown to bring down that death and disease burden. And that's what we need them to do."
Denmark suspends use of AstraZeneca vaccine over blood clot fears,Al Jazeera English,2021-03-11,8Rsgwd6yr7k,"Now Denmark has temporarily halted the use of the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by AstraZeneca. That's after reports of a small number of cases of blood clots. Denmark only approved the AstraZeneca vaccine six days ago for those above the age of 65. Let's bring in Paul Brennan, who's in London for us from on this. So, Paul, any reaction from Oxford AstraZeneca to this decision by Denmark to pose the use of its vaccine? There has been a reaction from AstraZeneca yet. I mean, they said that they're in contact with the Austrian authorities because Austria too is stopping using the one particular batch of AstraZeneca jabs, AstraZeneca vaccines. After two incidents there, one was a death from a coagulation disorder and the other one was an illness from a pulmonary embolism. So, these are all sort of vaguely blood clot related things. The Danish situation appears to be born of an abundance of caution because the Danish health authority has said that they haven't given any details of exactly how many blood clot cases there have been and they haven't given any details of the background history of the one person who's died in Denmark. But what they did say was that it was currently not possible to conclude whether there was a link between the vaccine and these deaths. So, the health minister said, and I'm quoting, we are acting early, it needs to be thoroughly investigated. Now, other countries appear to be suspending their use, watching what's happening, waiting for the outcome of that. It is a temporary suspension for two weeks. Other countries Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Latvia. I'm also hearing that Norway, a line that's just dropping, is that Norway appears to be halting for the time being its use of AstraZeneca. But AstraZeneca issued a statement earlier, well yesterday actually, saying the safety of its vaccine had been extensively studied and the vaccine was generally well tolerated and the number of thromboembolic events, as it describes it, is no higher than that seen in the general population. So, it remains to be seen as to whether this is sort of supercorsious behaviour and action from Denmark and Norway, or whether it actually is something that needs to be more concerned with. There have been millions of these vaccines administered, 22 million in excess here in the UK alone, more than 3 million in the European Union. So, to have two cases in one country and two cases in another with no firm link between the vaccine and those cases does leave a lot of questions still unanswered. Paul elsewhere in Europe, France is relaxing restrictions on international travelers. Yeah, I mean the French have really had a struggle with coronavirus and they have been looking at increasing numbers, but they are very keen of course with the summer arriving to try to open up their economy. The other thing of course is Germany is also facing the prospect of a third wave and it's ironic perhaps that while other countries are sort of shutting down their vaccination programmes albeit temporarily, Norway, Denmark, Germany is screaming out for more vaccines and trying to get more vaccines into the arms of its citizens. So, it is curious. It's an indication I think of the not exactly joined up thinking that is taking place across the European continent, across the European Union, with these different countries taking very different approaches in relation to a reopening and b, the vaccination programmes themselves. Paul, thank you very much for that Paul Brennan live there in London. Well, let's discuss the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine some more now with stereo moissals, who's a molecular virologist, Cindy, associate professor in cellular and molecular sciences at Northumbria University. He's joining us from Newcastle in the UK. Thank you very much for being with us. So, as we've heard concerns from Denmark about this AstraZeneca vaccine and investigation is underway there, Austria has also suspended using one batch of AstraZeneca doses while it investigates a death there from coagulation disorders. First of all, can there be a link between blood clots and a vaccine? Well, there can be a potential link claimed about anything and everything, right? But the reality about these things is in the absolute numbers. So, whilst one cannot be 100 percent sure that one batch of this vaccine might have something wrong with it, it's entirely possible, just like with aspirin, there might be one batch that something's wrong with it. The reality is we need to see enough of these events in the population to be in a larger number than you would normally expect to be able to claim that actually there's a specific direct link between the two. So, if you think about the age groups that are prioritised for vaccination right now, these are the elderly people. Generally, these are individuals who have pre-existing conditions and they're prone to strokes, they're prone to pulmonary embolisms, they're prone to heart attacks, these things will happen. So, you would need to see that you have much more of this happening amongst those age groups because these people are getting a vaccine before you could safely say, ah, it seems to be something they're vaccine. So, all the governments are doing the correct thing right now, just stopping checking to make sure everything's okay. So, you don't think they're overreacting these countries. No way also announcing now that it's suspending its AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine rollout. No, I don't think that's a no-very action. I think it's an appropriate response. There's a concern that has been raised. It needs to be looked at carefully, independently, and make sure that those numbers are interpreted accurately for public safety, whether that's protecting people from the virus or protecting people from something that might have happened with this batch of vaccine. But the likelihood in general that the vaccine may have had something on the world is minimal. The likelihood that a batch of the vaccine may have something wrong with it is very small, vanishingly small. Right. But as you know, there's been concern about the speed at which these vaccines have been developed. What are some of the most serious possible side effects associated to these COVID-19 vaccines, not just the AstraZeneca ones, but the other ones that are also being rolled out right now? Well, that's the thing. We keep pandering this phrase, all these things are being developed too quickly. I would like to flip that coin and point out to everybody how fast we can develop things for diseases we want to do something about. If we put the investment at the time and the resources there, we are able to respond to diseases very quickly. That's how advanced we are scientifically. So on top of that, please understand that all the clinical trials that were necessary were carried about for all these vaccines that you just listed. All the data has been publicly made available and therefore it is not accurate to say that this was developed fast, that corners were cut. No, there were no corners cut. If anything, all the people that have a role to play in the approval worked hand in hand in the process to make it as fast as possible. So I would like to say to people, you know what, let's try and get society and economy to solve diseases and healthcare problems. Looking at this as a paradigm of how we can do things better rather than the other way around. Now we'll possibly go rogue. Right. Some reassuring. Yes, with regards to what can possibly go wrong, the point is that those studies that were carried out didn't show that there is anything on to all that we need to be worried about. Apart from a sore arm, maybe a bit of fever for a few days, which is a sign that your immune system is kicking in and it's doing what it's supposed to do. So I wouldn't be worried too much about these observations. The authorities are doing the right thing to make sure nothing on to what is happening. So we shouldn't worry too much."
EU sues AstraZeneca over Covid vaccine delays - BBC News,BBC News,2021-04-26,KtxrjFf1EJw,"A spokesman for the European Commission says it's begun legal action against the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca over alleged breaches of contractual agreements for the supply of its coronavirus vaccine. The two sides have been in dispute over the matter for several months. A Europe correspondent Nick Beak has the details. We've heard from a European Commission spokesperson in Brussels saying that the European Commission will now take legal action against AstraZeneca. Of course, the British Swedish company, the two sides have been embroiled in this pretty bitter dispute over the past few months. At its heart, the European Commission believes that AstraZeneca has been favouring the UK over EU countries. And for example, last month we heard the companies say that it would be delivering about a third of the doses that apparently the contract promises. So up till June of this year, the EU and EU countries will be getting a 100 million doses of the vaccine compared with a 300 million they were expecting. Now, I think at this point we can't really say what the nature of this legal action will be and more so what the impact of it will be. But certainly in the hours and days ahead that might become clear. But we did have an indication this was coming because the Commission sent a legal letter to AstraZeneca which reflected their anger. And now today we're hearing that they are continuing with this legal approach. Nick Beak reporting there will a short while ago, AstraZeneca issued a statement expressing regret at the European Commission's decision to take legal action. Over the supply of COVID-19 vaccines, it says, our company is about to deliver almost 50 million doses to European countries by the end of April. In line with our forecast, AstraZeneca has fully complied with the advanced purchase agreement with the European Commission and will strongly defend itself in court."
Oxford professor on the timeline of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine,CNBC Television,2020-11-27,ujQrmvF0yxQ,"AstraZeneca and Oxford University will likely conduct an additional trial for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, acknowledging a mistake in the dosage received by trial participants. This comes after AstraZeneca announced on Monday that the vaccine is up to 90 percent effective in late-stage trials. So joining us now, Professor Sir John Bell, who led and oversaw the vaccine's development at Oxford and Andrew Lloyd Webber, legendary composer and one of the participants in the vaccine trial, a very good afternoon to you both. The pleasure to have you both with us. I'm sorry there were some technical issues getting things fired up, but good afternoon to you both. Right, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Professor Sir John, I'll start with you if I may. We touch base on Monday and Tuesday when the news flow following your vaccine announcement was universally positive based on its effectiveness, its relative cost. And since then, the tone has turned a little bit in terms of the reports, as I just mentioned, has it turned unfairly? Do you still see this as an overwhelmingly positive set of results? Yeah, so I mean, there's always a problem in announcing scientific results by press release. And that is that you don't have all the data out there and people aren't able to really look and think about the data properly. So I think our position now is that we're in the process of getting a peer review publication out that will be able to lay out all the data so people can examine it and think about it carefully. And I'm sure the producers of the other vaccines are probably doing the same and then will be in a much better position to know what we're doing. But ultimately, actually, to determine whether this is a safe and effective vaccine, it's going to be up to the regulators to do that. And again, we welcome the fact that they'll be able to look at a casted independent eye and what's going on. And of course, all of these trials rests on people volunteering to be a candidate in the vaccine. And Andrew, you were one of those people. Why did you put yourself forward in the first place? Well, as you probably know, I've been fighting to get theaters reopened and indeed all forms of indoor spaces up and down, not only just Britain, but all over America and the world. Based really on the information that I got very much earlier in the year, in fact January, to be precise from South Korea, where life performances have continued all that time. And because I really tried to absolutely bang the drum for live entertainment, it seemed to me that the very least I could do is I didn't live that very far from Oxford, was to volunteer as an oldie to be seen if I could be accepted onto the trial. And Andrew, as your industry, as you know, it's so well, for live theatre and live musical performances, how have governments, particularly the UK and the US, responded? Have they been helpful or does the future of your industry rest on science and developments like this vaccine? Well, obviously, it clearly does depend a great deal on the development of the vaccine, but there have been a number of measures and load of measures that have been applied in say Korea and in Japan, for example, which have mitigated the effect of the virus enormously. And it has been frustrating because one hits the health authorities all the time. Every time you come up with something new, or something old that has been successfully trial in other places, there's always some reason why you can't proceed with it. And I know it's actually a frustrating government actually in Britain too. However, we are where we are. And I can only report that I don't know whether I've actually had the real vaccine because, of course, by the nature of the experiment. I wouldn't know, but if I have, I haven't had any effects from it whatsoever, other than feeling great. Professor Sir John, whether the results suggest 90 percent efficacy or the 60 percent efficacy that will dive into in a moment, when is it realistic to think that we'll be back to normal going to live theatre and have herd immunity in countries like the UK and US? Well, I think the rollout of the vaccines is likely to happen pretty quickly after, at the end of December, the beginning of January. And my expectation is the UK, which, of course, is a much smaller pool than the US, but we should be pretty substantially vaccinated. I would have thought by spring, maybe late spring, but certainly by spring. So I'm hoping we're going to get back to normal and be able to enjoy the theatre as we always did before. And I'm completely with Andrew that we need to work hard to try and get those things back and play. Shepherd Smith here. Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."
AstraZeneca Vaccine May Reduce Covid Transmission on a Single Dose,Bloomberg Quicktake,2021-02-03,NE0UDhUc8f8,"Learned yesterday that AstraZeneca's COVID vaccine showed 82 percent effectiveness with a three-month gap between shots. The vaccine may also significantly reduce transmission of the virus, potentially helping speed up the process of achieving herd immunity. So what does this all mean for the global vaccination efforts and our attempts to get past this global pandemic? Dr. Amish Adolge is senior scholar for the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He joins me now. Dr. Adolge, it's always great when you join us. Thanks so much for being here. I want to talk about this new data that we learned yesterday about the Astra shot. How significant is it in and what stands out to you the most when it comes to this data dump? I think it's very significant because what we had heard is we knew that these vaccines are very, very effective at preventing serious disease, preventing hospitalization and preventing death. But we really wanted to know, will they decrease the spread? And most of us in the field thought that that was going to be the case because of the how effective they were and what we in the early data that we've seen for example in places like Israel. So I think this really shows that these vaccines not only prevent serious disease, but they're also going to decrease spread. And these are going to be the solution out of this pandemic. And I think it's important to know that because a lot of people were worried that after I get the vaccine, am I never going to be able to do anything normally? And I think this is a sign of hope. And I think that the other vaccines will likely have data that has a very similar finding as well. Is this the only vaccine where we have findings similar to this? Like do we know in terms of Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, if you can still spread or to what extent you could still spread the coronavirus after being vaccinated? We have limited data from the Moderna vaccine and there are studies going on, but they do show that when you look, you'll find that they decrease spread. And you have to remember that these trials and this whole vaccine was developed not really to decrease spread, but to decrease hospitalization and decrease death and to be able to protect the most vulnerable populations from the most serious consequences of this disease. So that's really what this vaccine program has been and that's reflected in the priority groups, nursing home residents, the elderly, for example. But I do think you're going to see added benefits in terms of spread as well. But you have to remember that this virus isn't going to go anywhere. Coronavirus does not disappear from the human population, especially if they efficiently transmit. And we have four coronavirus is that it costs 25 percent of our common colds. And this is likely going to be the fifth seasonal coronavirus, but it will cease to be a public health emergency. Once we get our vulnerable populations vaccinated. Timeline for that Dr. Dulljab, what do you think? I think in the best case scenario, we're looking probably into late summer before we cross that herd immunity threshold. But remember, we're going to see benefits before that. As people, for example, get vaccinated and they're less likely to need hospitalization at that, that's going to change the risk perception. You won't see hospitals worrying about capacity capacity concerns. For example, they won't have to cancel thyroid surgeries. For example, all of that will change once we get our vulnerable populations vaccinated. I want to ask about where we are in terms of our understanding of the various variants that are out there right now and to what extent the vaccines that have been approved or perhaps will be approved soon by emergency use authorization protect against those new variants. What we know is that the vaccines that have been put up against the variants, the UK variant seems to be something that the vaccines can handle. The South African variant is a little bit more questionable, but I want to emphasize the fact that when you look at serious disease, hospitalization and death, those are the things that matter to all of us in the field, not mild disease. The vaccines do hold up well even against the South African variant, which means that maybe the current vaccines you still get infected and you might have symptomatic disease, but you are not likely to die or need hospitalization, which is a win because these are vaccines going up against a variant that's kind of evolved to evade the immune response. So, I do think that this is good news that our vaccines are very effective at preventing what matters, deaths and hospitalizations."
Britain presses on with AstraZeneca vaccine,Reuters,2020-11-27,YYsjKW9oy_I,"Britain is pushing ahead with the Oxford University AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, asking its regulator Friday to assess it for a possible rollout. Meantime, the Philippines and Thailand secured millions of doses, giving the shot a vote of confidence after experts raised questions about trial data earlier this week. The UK government, which has secured 100 million doses of the vaccine, has targeted a rollout to begin before Christmas. AstraZeneca's candidate is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheap-of-price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures. The Thai government signed a deal on Friday to procure 26 million doses of the vaccine, and officials in the Philippines said they would secure 2.6 million shots and were negotiating a possible purchase of a further 1 million doses. The announcements came after some scientists raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90 percent effective in a subgroup of trial participants who, by error, initially received a half dose, followed by a full dose. AstraZeneca's CEO said on Thursday that the drugmaker was likely to run an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its vaccine using the lower dose. The company had released trial data on Monday that showed its experimental vaccine prevented on average 70 percent of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil. While the success rate was 90 percent in the subgroup, some experts said the relatively small number of participants made it harder to be confident in the findings. AstraZeneca said the administering of the half-dose has been reviewed and approved by independent data safety monitors and the UK regulator, adding the regulator publicly confirmed that there was no concern."
Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine shows positive immune response in early study,CNBC Television,2020-07-20,-a_D2XMafac,"Getting some vaccine news to start the week as Lancet weighs in on AstraZeneca's COVID-19 candidate. Let's get to Meg Turell, Meg. Hi, Carl. Highly anticipated results coming from Oxford University, which is partnered with AstraZeneca, still digging through the details as they literally just came in. But essentially showing that the vaccine induced an immune response in these participants, this is the Phase 1-2 trial run in more than 1,000 participants in the UK, one of the first human studies of this vaccine. And they looked at both giving one dose and two doses of the vaccine, and they did find that after giving two doses, the immune response was stronger. Based on how they measured the generation of these antibodies from the vaccine, they found that all of them, all of the participants generated antibodies with the first dose with one way of measuring, but not with another way of measuring. But with the second dose, all of them did so. You're seeing AstraZeneca's stock down more than 2 percent now on these news. These were highly anticipated data with very positive sort of preambles last week, coming out suggesting they were very strong. So as people are parsing through the data here, we will get a read on whether this matches up with extremely high expectations. But importantly, the researchers also reporting this generally appeared to be safe. They did note that about 70 percent of participants reported fatigue and headache and taking paracetamol tended to help with any of the effects of getting the shot, guys. But still reading through these data, they do say this generated an immune response. And of course, they're taking this into a much larger set of phase three efficacy trials to really get a read on whether this will be protective."
Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine approved by U.K. regulator,CNBC Television,2020-12-30,wrBQXhF8_l8,"Breaking overnight, this kind of interesting, the UK. Remember first with Pfizer, now, UK, first with the AstraZeneca. COVID vaccine. I'm developed in conjunction with the University of Oxford and okayed for emergency use, CBC's Jumana. But that, she joins us now from London, NISL. I guess add to the supply. It's a little bit different. What can you tell us, Jumana? Yeah, no, so it's a groundbreaking day for the UK and also for the world, Joe, and actually the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson just tweeted out calling this a massive triumph for British science. But to your point, there are a few differences between this vaccine and the existing vaccines that are available on the market, specifically Biser Plains egg and the Moderna vaccine. This is actually a viral vector vaccine, which basically means that it can be stored at much higher temperatures. So at normal refrigeration temperature between two degrees Celsius and eight degrees Celsius, it also means that it can be scaled up very quickly in terms of mass production. And to that point, AstraZeneca today has said that they've been speaking to some of their global partners about the rollout of up to three billion doses of this vaccine in 2021. So that has huge implications for lower income and middle income countries and the rest of the world. That's with the UK specifically. Well, the country has ordered a hundred million doses of the vaccine. That's pretty much enough to cover the entire population, excluding children, and are expected to receive as many as four million doses in the next couple of days. AstraZeneca has said that they're ready to start distributing today and tomorrow. So the Javs can start as soon as Janie the fourth. And just a quick word as well on the government scheme to roll out the vaccine as the other vaccines. This is a two dosage regimen. And typically, there would be a four-week interval between the first dose and the second dose. But what the UK governments are saying is that they want to give as many people as possible that initial dosage. So as many inoculations as they can actually roll out in that particular period before giving the second dosage. And this is so that as many people as possible get that baseline immunity, they wait 12 weeks and then receive the second dosage. And that's part of a new strategy and something that we've not seen before being tried out here in the UK. But certainly very, very big news for the UK and for the world, Joe. Shepard Smith here. Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."
"AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine up to 90% effective, late stage trials show",CBS Mornings,2020-11-23,9emTrFGghqQ,"But there is some positive breaking news this morning. Another potential coronavirus vaccine is showing very promising results. Charlie Dagger is at Oxford University in England with more than the AstraZeneca vaccine trial. Charlie, I know the medical community very excited about this one. So what makes this different than the other ones that we've talked about? And good morning. They're very excited here at Oxford Gale. Good evening to you. And here's why. It not only performed as well as they'd hoped it would. But this vaccine might stop the transmission of the virus too. Large scale trials showed the vaccine prevented more than 70 percent of people from getting COVID. That number jumps up to 90 percent if half the dose is used, followed by a booster shot of a full dose. Data shows it works across all age groups and it's safe. Mild side effects include headache, fatigue and a sore arm. Volunteers were also swabbed on a weekly basis to see if it showed a reduction in asymptomatic cases when people spread the virus without knowing they had it. The reason we did all of those swabs was to ask the question, could a vaccine prevent transmission as well as disease? And this is one way of doing that. I think it's the first vaccine to report on that endpoint. The US Warp Speed Program has pumped more than a billion dollars into the development of the Oxford vaccine and returned for an initial rollout of 300 million doses. The vaccines only need basic refrigeration rather than deep freeze temperatures. That makes distribution easier and faster. Upscaling the manufacturer of the vaccine is also easier and AstraZeneca have pledged to make three billion doses in 2021. Now the big question, when are we going to see it in the United States? Well AstraZeneca said today they're in conversations, their words with the FDA, but it is possible that this vaccine may be rolled out to other countries before it reaches America. Anthony? All right, but the vaccine that prevents transmission, that's really encouraging news, Charlie Daggett and England. Thanks, Charlie."
Astrazeneca Sued in High Court over COVID-19 Vaccine,BlackBeltBarrister,2023-11-14,RQwcX-B6luw,"AstraZeneca is being sued in the high court for a lawsuit that claims its COVID-19 vaccine was defective. But many people are not aware that there is already a scheme in the UK for compensation payments if you've been injured as a result of taking a vaccine. Those who are severely disabled as a result of taking the COVID-19 vaccine may be eligible and qualify for a single lump-some tax-free payment of £120,000 a piece. Many people are not aware of this, but to the extent that some people over on my other channel, Black Belt Secrets, make sure you go and subscribe there as well, called this out as being conspiracy theorists going after cash. Now, after a couple of videos on this now, here on Black Belt Barrier, I'm going to go into a little bit more of the law, and over on Black Belt Secrets, you can see a more general summary if you want to go there as well. I'll link that below. But COVID-19 vaccines are not the only thing that people can be eligible for these payouts if they are severely injured, disabled as a result of a vaccine. In fact, the vaccine damage payment scheme covers things including coronavirus, which was added as it was reported as a precaution, along with dip theory, influenza, measles, the mumps, all sorts of other different things that are on this list, which I'll link below so you can go and read that as well for yourself. And there's a number of different bits of legislation all around surrounding vaccines about the pre-approval, the post-authorization, and all of these kind of things about how they are tested, how they are supposed to be vigorously tested before they're safe and released, and so on. Now, on 3rd of December 2020, the UK Department of Health and Social Care issued a press release announcing that the COVID-19 vaccines will generally be added to the vaccine damage payment scheme. This announcement made the day after the Pfizer vaccine was granted temporary authorization. This press release stated that there were no safety concerns identified during the clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine. However, as a precautionary step, it was said that this was added to this scheme to provide financial assistance in the extremely rare circumstances where somebody might be severely disabled as a result of taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Now, according to official data released under an FOI request to the NHS Open Data Portal, the following statistics are quite interesting. The numbers in terms of people are indeed very low, which fits the categorisation of extremely rare circumstances. However, there have been a number of payouts across various different age groups, so I'll go through those statistics and then address why it might therefore be that there are two cases coming to the high court against AstraZeneca. Let's look at the statistics first of all. In the age bracket of 0 to 17, 29 people made a claim of which 0 received a payment. In the age bracket of 18 to 29, 556 people made a claim, but only 8 people were paid out to the tune of 960,000 pounds. In the age bracket of 30 to 39, 1171 people made a claim of which 16 people were paid out to the tune of 1.9 million pounds. In the age bracket of 40 to 49, 1499 people made a claim and 37 received a payment. In the age bracket of 50 to 59, 1871 people made a claim of whom 44 people received a payout. In the age bracket of 60 to 65, a shorter age bracket this time, 885 people made a claim, 24 people received a payout, and 66 onwards, 1354 people made a claim, and 19 people received a payout. A grand total payout under this scheme of 17.7 million pounds for severe disabilities or injuries caused by the COVID-19 vaccine. Now, this of course is not conspiracy theorist discussion. These are actual statistics from NHS Open Data Portal as to those that have been paid out under this scheme. So why is it then that there are two cases going against AstraZeneca to the high court, and why are ministers calling for change to say that this scheme is no longer adequate? Well, according to court filings which have recently been revealed, the claim suggests that these vaccines were defective in some way, and resulting in very serious injuries including speech difficulties, reduced cognition, memory and processing. And accordingly, the claimants are seeking damages from AstraZeneca. It has to be said that in April 2021, the Metzons and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency issued an updated information to say that there were possible risks of extremely rare and unlikely to occur specific types of blood clots, following the vaccination with the AstraZeneca job. This regulator also said that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh any risks, but advised careful consideration given to people who are at high risk of specific types of blood clots, or because of their medical condition. So on the one hand, we do have this vaccine damage payment scheme, under which eligible people will receive a tax-free one-off payment of £120,000. On the other hand, many people are claiming that this is not sufficient for the injuries that they claim to have sustained after taking a vaccine such as the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. So whilst we're at an early stage, and this case has obviously not gone to court yet, it's not going to be in court for around a year or so, it is going to come to the forefront, and the high court is going to have to rule on the evidence before it as to firstly whether or not the severity of these injuries were directly resultant from the COVID vaccine. And secondly, I presume whether the provisions under the vaccine damage payment scheme are already sufficient. But either way, as you might remember that I've said in previous videos, this whole pandemic is likely to result and has resulted in a great number of different cases for many years to come. I've experienced many contractual claims whereby parties have either been unwilling or unable to fulfill their obligations under the contract, and those cases have gone to court. There have been a great deal of employment cases, discrimination cases, and of course there'll be a whole catalogue of medical injury claims for many years to come. But as always, I will keep you updated on any of these. If you have specific questions, do leave them in the comments section below. Please do go over to Black Belt Secrets, check out my video there where I talk a little bit more about those statistics. And just while I was putting this video together, partly as a bit of a caveat and disclaimer, and partly just because I thought it was entirely uncanny. Somebody sent me an email from the NHS to say that they are a priority for seasonal flu and COVID-19 vaccinations, having both vaccinations will reduce the risk of serious illness and help to recover more quickly if they catch the flu or COVID-19. And then details about how to book it to go book online by going to NHS.uk slash book hyphen COVID. So all of those details are available on the NHS website. I know many of you are supportive of the COVID vaccines and I know many of you are against them. My videos here as the caveat are in no way to provide you medical advice. There are no way to encourage or discourage you from having the COVID vaccine. This is entirely at your discretion and which should be entirely at the advice and direction of your own personal medical practitioner. So if you see this video or you see any other video about the COVID vaccine and any other vaccine for that matter, you should not rely on those as a replacement for your medical advice any more than you would rely on my videos as a replacement for legal advice. You shouldn't and you should always seek formal advice in each of those situations. So please do speak to your own doctor if you have questions, if you have concerns and seek their personal views. Some doctors will give you their personal views as part of their professional service to you."
"AstraZeneca vaccine not recommended for those under 55, NACI says",Global News,2021-03-29,8VAHBLCZKYg,"We begin with more uncertainty about the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, which Canada is relying on to speed up the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization now recommends that the AstraZeneca shot not be given to people under the age of 55. It says there is not enough data to be certain the benefit outweighs the risk. In Europe, there are a few rare but serious cases of blood clots in people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. The European regulator investigated 25 cases of clotting out of roughly 20 million people who had been vaccinated in the UK and EU. Almost all the cases were in women under 55. There have been no reports of similar cases here in Canada. Federal officials are calling today's change a precaution until more studies are done on the potential risks in Canada. I think we're all on the same page that this is something that's very rare, that we need to continue to follow it. I fully understand that this can be confusing, but what I would say is, again, precautionary approach. And we'll move forward as we get more information. AstraZeneca is critical to Canada's vaccine rollout. 1.5 million more doses are set to arrive tomorrow from the US. There's already been so much evolving advice about it, and this latest change will almost certainly damage public confidence. This morning, Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott, who is 65, made a point of appearing on camera to get the AstraZeneca vaccine. She's urging people who are eligible to take it if it is offered to them. There has been a roller coaster of advice, though, about the AstraZeneca vaccine. Mike Armstrong has our top story tonight on the latest twist, and what it means for provincial rollout plans. It wasn't an announcement any province wanted to make, but it came one after another. PEI was the first to pull AstraZeneca for people under the age of 55, saying there may be a problem with blood clots. For those islanders who have been vaccinated to date using AstraZeneca, 1680 of them, I understand this news would be a little bit disturbing to hear this. This is still a good vaccine. It's still an effective vaccine. Whether it was Newfoundland in Labrador or Manitoba, the move came with a message. The AstraZeneca pause is just a precaution. While we still believe that probably the benefits for all ages outweigh the risks, I'm not comfortable with probably. The provinces were informed over the weekend. Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization was changing its recommendations. The reason? A problem that was already known appears to be worse than originally believed. Much of Europe suspended the use of AstraZeneca earlier this month when the blood clotting issue was first observed. Eventually, most countries resumed using it, determining the benefits outweighed the risks. At least 15 people died of a syndrome health authorities are now calling VIPAD. Symptoms appeared four to 16 days after vaccination, but it was rare, about one in a million. Now, a German institute has determined it's about one in 100,000. Cases identified so far have primarily been in women under the age of 55, although cases and men have also been reported. Now, the idea of still using the AstraZeneca vaccine in older groups may seem counterintuitive, but in terms of risk versus reward, it makes sense. VIPAD is rare in older people, and they're at a much higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Several European countries are already reserving AstraZeneca for older groups, Sweden announced last Thursday was only going to use it on people 65 years and over. My carms on global news. Montreal."
WHO recommends Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for over-65s,The Telegraph,2021-02-10,nlA3SBe1kd0,"Since we have identified people over 65 as one of our priority groups in the priorization roadmap, we have based a totality of looking at the safety and the immunogenicity data and therefore we recommend for the vaccine to be used in people 18 years and above without an upper age limit. That means people over 65 years of age should be given the vaccination. These guidelines that are being released today are very, very important because the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is one of the main vaccines at this point in the COVAX facility. It's going to be procured in hundreds of millions of doses and distributed around the world. So many countries will be receiving their first tranches of the vaccine from the COVAX facility later in February. So this is an important milestone and we hope that this will be followed very soon by the recommendation on the emergency use listing of this product. So I think it's an important day because it really, this is one of those vaccines which can be stored in ordinary refrigerated temperatures and therefore it's going to be very useful for a large number of countries. With different situations on the ground so logistically it's easier to use."
Coronavirus: Mass AstraZeneca vaccine rollout begins in Victoria | 9 News Australia,9 News Australia,2021-03-08,-P5zaSoDGPQ,"A newly open clinic in Melbourne's north is aiming to process 10,000 vaccinations a week after delivering Victoria's first dose of AstraZeneca today. As Mark Santomartino reports, select GPs are preparing to administer the jab from March 22nd. After months analysing the data... So today you're going to get the AstraZeneca vaccine? Professor Ben Cowie will wait up to 12 weeks for his follow-up COVID shot. After the second dose, we know that that efficacy, if we space it out, is above 80 percent against symptomatic infection. The one to punch of Pfizer and now AstraZeneca is speeding things up for Austin Health's frontline staff, helped by a new mass vaccination clinic in Heidelberg. We don't want to sit around and wait until every last one A is done, so this will be a bit of overlap. I honestly think we'll be starting to move out into 1B in the next couple of weeks. As many as 10,000 people will check in using these computers each and every week once this brand new clinic scales up and these 20 cubicles are open to the public. From the 15th, this clinic will be running from 8 in the morning to 8 at night, 7 days a week. That needs around 50 nurses a day. It's been quite humbling how many nurses from around Victoria have put their hands up. Nurses like Jessica Amalfi. It's a quick booking system I could even do it before or after work. By the end of this week, one dose should have been received by all staff in Hotel Quarantine, where another resident has tested positive. Was an airline worker resigned to stand? Zero cases again in terms of community numbers. If our hotel quarantine is so good, why if the plane stopped? Our best defence, vaccinating all eligible Victorians by the end of October. If we look like that we're not on track for that, we will take steps to ensure that that occurs. Mark Centro Martino. So is he. Nine news."
AstraZeneca Lowers Vaccine Efficacy,Bloomberg Television,2021-03-25,3FrLCQIM0Is,"What a difference some 48 hours make. It's not a whole lot different to efficacy rate, but it is a little bit lower. What's the impact this going to have? Hi, Ann Marie. About to me, this has all turned out to be no more than a storm in the T Cup. I really don't understand why that DSMB data safety monitoring board of the trial did what it did for a three percentage point difference. And of course, we focus on the 76, the 7976. The efficacy in the older population went from 80 to 85. And the efficacy against severe disease remained at 100 percent with now eight cases in the placebo group. So I think I really don't know what happened here. I don't understand why this DSMB did what it did. I really think somebody has to have a good look inside to see whether there was any malpractice or activity that shouldn't have been done. It's very interesting. And many are saying similar to what you're saying, that this is just really a rounding error. So why was there so much of a spotlight put on this? But Sam, when you look at this, and it's just another doom and gloom cloud for AstraZeneca, especially on the PR front, will this be harder for them to get approval in the United States? No, the FDA focuses on the data. They don't care if somebody disgruntled it at DSMB with disgruntled in the Astra, wanted to push a press release out or say something. I think that's got nothing to do with it. It might impact the public perception of the vaccine. But that would be so sad, Anne-Marie, because at the end of the day, this was completely unnecessary. This was a solid trial with very nice data. OK, you may not look as high as the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna efficacy. But they were done six months ago. And frankly, what we really care about with these vaccines at the moment is controlling severe disease and hospitalizations. So I don't think it would make an impact. And you're right, it would be sad, because there's so many people who are just desperate to get in line, to get their shot. Sam, just very quickly, I want to get your sense on what we're expecting out of the EU today. Do you think we could see a quote, win-win scenario between the EU and the UK in terms of vaccine exports? Yeah, but Anne-Marie, just to note, I am 24 hours into having had my first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine and still here's telling you the story. So I'm glad that the vaccine, at least, is rolling out in the UK. We're happy to hear it. Yeah, thank you. The EU and the UK have to sort this out, because at the end of the day, it benefits nobody to have this kind of fight going on. And there was another press release from AstraZeneca, so they're talking about all the stockpiles that the EU has talked about in Italy. I really wish, really, really wish, if I had one wish left, that the politicians stay out of this and let scientists and medical experts get on with their jobs."
US study of AstraZeneca vaccine proves efficacy l GMA,ABC News,2021-03-22,aT_zuPe2Sa8,"I want to turn now to more on the fight against the virus and that breaking news in the race to vaccinate Oxford Astrosinica releasing data from their US trial saying it's 79 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 and a hundred percent effective against hospitalization. Let's bring in Dr. Jean Aston. Dr. Jean Aston joins us now with the potential fourth shot we could get here in the US Dr. Aston so people here 79 percent efficacy. What do we make of it? Well, TJ, I mean, as we've been saying from the beginning at different data endpoints will have different numbers and people shouldn't necessarily get bogged down in the number that they hear in a headline. It's really the deep dive that's important when you hear a hundred percent effective against preventing hospitalizations. That's a big deal. That's going to save lives. That's going to help the population where this vaccine is given. But remember how things play out in other countries in other parts of the world important, but we do things differently here and to get FDA authorization FDA approval. That is considered the global gold standard. So we have to look at the data under a microscope and there are still a lot of gaps and unanswered questions in terms of this particular vaccine. Okay, those questions and you mentioned other countries, Dr. Aston. Some countries stopped using this vaccine didn't want it because of concerns about blood clots. So now with this new report out about this trial, is that going to boost confidence globally about it? Well, only time will tell TJ. I mean, right now they're saying they have seen zero significant severe side effects in clinical trials when we've been following the clotting issue concerns in Europe and other countries. We have to remember that concept of background events. People will have clots, heart attacks, strokes in the general population every single day. Some of those will occur in people who have just gotten the vaccine because we're seeing more and more people get vaccinated. It's only if those events go up above the background rate that there's a safety signal. And right now there's been no evidence of that, but we will be looking at that very, very closely. And President Biden has already said there will be enough vaccine for everyone here in the US every adult. That's with the three vaccines we have approved. This is a fourth. Is this new data really going to make a difference if we get a fourth one in the pipeline? TJ, some people are saying no because if it gets authorization here in the US by the time that that goes through, we may already have in fact we are projected to already have enough vaccines for every single adult in the US. So there are still a lot of unanswered questions here that we'll be following in the future. Of course Dr. Ashen, thank you so much. I'll see you on TV later. Hi everyone, George Stephanopoulos here.

What you need to know about the AstraZeneca vaccine,ABC News,2021-03-25,hnjNn_xMJ-s,"Let's bring in epidemiologists and ABC News Medical contributor Dr. John Brownstein. For more on this, Dr. Brownstein, good morning. AstraZeneca's new data shows efficacy against symptomatic COVID dropped slightly to 76 percent compared to the 79 percent. They reported earlier, but they're still claiming 100 percent in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. Why the discrepancy here? Why the different numbers and how much does that 3 percent matter? Yeah, I mean, overall, of course, it doesn't matter a lot. You know, there's been a lot of confusion, a lot of back and forth. Finally, we have this new sort of primary efficacy analysis that aligns with the data and safety monitoring board. Right? 76 percent efficacy, but remember, 85 percent for those 65 and over, and that 100 percent efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Most importantly, of course, no safety concerns. And so what ultimately has happened is that the endpoints and numbers of cases wind up from 141 to 191. But it really doesn't change very much. We should still remember this is data by press release. And so we need to be reassured that the FDA is going to comb through the data once they have access to it and we'll get a full readout. This is more about sloppy communication and building trust. It's the same results overall. This is a great vaccine, and it's going to be a great one to add into the mixed whether it's in the US or purely globally. So President Biden is reportedly looking to set a new target now higher than his initial 100 million shots in 100 days goal. How fast do you think we can vaccinate most eligible Americans? What would you recommend as a new goal? Yeah, I mean, just remember this nine weeks ago, we had about 8 percent of people over 65 have gone their first shot. Now we're that number is over 70 percent. We've done incredibly well to roll out this vaccine, especially recently. But I think we can get to 200 million in a 100 days. I mean, we're administering about 2.5 million doses per day. And that's going to improve. We've got 29 states expanding their eligibility. We've got 500 million COVID vaccines expected to be in the pipeline by May. So we just have to make sure that it's done equitably, right? Just by opening up more vaccines, we don't want to leave certain populations behind just because you can click Refresh on a website all day. That might give you an advantage over the people that don't have that time or access to technology. That's why the importance of community vaccination centers, mobile clinics, of course the pharmacies, need to fill in those vaccine deserts. And of course, we also have to be concerned that the supply doesn't overtake demand. And this is where hesitancy comes in. You know, there are pockets of this country that are still not clear that they should get this vaccine. So a lot of communication needs to be done in addition to the rollout to get to that sort of 200 million number. Several places are reporting a rise in cases, even a rise in hospitalizations in some areas. Overall though, it seemed like we were on the right track. So why do you think we're seeing these pocketed rises and how do we stop that? Yeah, I mean, I think it's partly related to this false sense of security. They're seeing this increase in cases while we're having this rapid reopening that's taking place. Cases have really plateaued in the country around 55,000 a day. This is a combination of the opening and increased mobility, but also the spread of new variants. We're seeing this B117 that is gradually becoming the dominant strain. And unfortunately, that actually has potentially higher mortality than the baseline strain that we had circulating. And this is playing out a little bit in Michigan where we're seeing this increase in hospitalizations. That's really taking place among the unvaccinated population, the younger age groups, the 30 to 49. That's a bit concerning because of course, that is a population that we just need to get that vaccine rolled out. So we can look to Israel where finally they're vaccinating the younger populations. And it's finally showing that hospitalizations are going down across the board. And just one reminder, vaccines work well against B117. So we shouldn't have that hold us up from getting the vaccine when it's ready for you. And I have some viewer questions for you now. These are questions that people sent to me on Twitter. The first is, what do we know about long-term side effects from the current vaccines? So we should remember that side effects are very, very rare in the serious ones. And especially when you look at previous vaccines, side effects really happen in the first few days, weeks of having the vaccine. There's really no signs that there are any long-term issues. And of course, remember, we've been testing these vaccines since mid-2020 and have shown incredible safety results. We've not been cutting any corners. And so these are incredible trials. But also now we have hundreds of millions of people that have had these vaccines. Again, safety data has looked incredibly good. I mean, of course, there's the mild side effects that you want, the fever, the headache, to show that the vaccines are working. But overall, there's no data support any long-term consequences of these vaccines. All right, Dr. Brownstein, I'm told we're out of time. We will continue with viewer questions the next time we chat. Thanks so much. Thank you. Hi, everyone. George Stephanopoulos here. Thanks for checking out the ABC News YouTube channel.

AstraZeneca scrambles to address concerns about vaccine efficacy data,PBS NewsHour,2021-03-23,dzrrLuaUyWk,"As we reported earlier, AstraZeneca is facing new questions today after a highly unusual reprimand from a board overseeing the company's clinical trials. Just yesterday, AstraZeneca announced its COVID-19 vaccine was highly effective. But today, it is scrambling to respond to allegations that it used misleading data. Nick Schifrin reports. AstraZeneca is one of the world's most important COVID vaccines in expensive, easy to administer, and the primary vaccine not only for Europe, but also for the UN's program for low and middle-income countries. But the independent American panel of experts that oversees the company's trials, accused the company in a letter seen by the New York Times of a selectively positive analysis of its own data. And the organization led by Dr. Anthony Fauci, blamed the company and acknowledged its actions would increase vaccine hesitancy. It had released an interim analysis of data from before February 17th and would release a primary analysis of the most recent data by Thursday. To discuss this, I'm joined by Dr. Jennifer Nazo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Dr. Nazo, welcome to the news hour. What did AstraZeneca do wrong? And how unusual is this pushback? Well, this whole situation is quite unusual, and I don't fully understand why this happened. Essentially, there's a difference in interpretation of the data in just a few percentage points. And the DSMB, the group from the NIH that put out the letter wanted a slightly lower range of numbers to be presented, and AstraZeneca put it a slightly higher. The difference is really marginal. And so why they would have done this is quite unclear. Unfortunately, what it does then is raise questions about a vaccine that we don't need to have right now. We don't need to be having these questions that are not related to real issues of safety or efficacy. It just is an unfortunate situation in that it could increase people's hesitancy about receiving this vaccine. But this isn't the first time that there have been questions about AstraZeneca, the company had a dosing error during clinical trials that it didn't disclose. Initially, the company promised about three times what it's delivered to Europe. Does all this increase the hesitancy, and does the company have more questions to answer? I mean, it could. And that's really the worry here. To be clear, I don't think there is any reason in any of these stories to doubt the safety and efficacy of this vaccine. However, the perhaps even perceived lack of full transparency or the perception that the company isn't disclosing everything it needs to will unnecessarily raise questions about the vaccine. At a time, when we are deeply concerned about people's willingness to be vaccinated. So it is unfortunate that this has happened. It didn't need to happen. I think Dr. Fauci's assessment of it as being an unforced error is a correct one. And it's just unfortunate. The company had a setback last week where a number of European countries had wanted to pause the use of the vaccine for real legitimate concerns about safety. Those have been resolved in the sense that the European Medicines Agency has reviewed the data, has spoken in favor for it. So has the WHO. And it was thought that this press release that they issued could help restore some confidence in a much needed way for this vaccine. But now the story is today, I think, are only going to add some more question marks, which is just quite unfortunate. How can those question marks be answered? Thinking about three very public world leaders who got AstraZeneca just in the last few days, Moon of South Korea, Boris Johnson of the UK last week, Thailand's Prime Minister as well, what can be done to address the issues of hesitancy? Well, I think national leaders have to do just that, continue to show support for the vaccine. Obviously, we're going to wait the full review of the AstraZeneca data in the United States. And I think, you know, I'm guessing that the review will be quite favorable. That will be important. But crucially, the company needs to answer for what happened here. You know, they said they would come back in 48 hours with new data. It's really unfortunate. We shouldn't have to wait 48 hours to understand why they released 79 percent in their press release yesterday when the DSMB had advised them to look at a different set of data. There are some questions that they have to answer. And I think they have to answer it quite soon and quite completely. That's really important for them to disclose as much information as possible to just answer these questions, because in a pause, in a gap of information, unfortunately, people can fill that gap with the wrong information. And finally, the U.S. produces about a quarter of the world's COVID-19 vaccines, but so far has exported 0 percent. The Biden administration points out it is the leading investor of the U.N.'s COVAX program, but do you believe the U.S. government needs to do better at exporting vaccines around the world? So I understand national leaders, Dilemma. You know, their first responsibility is to the people who elected them. And I understand the pressure to get Americans vaccinated as quickly as possible and to focus on that before we think about sharing vaccines with the rest of the world. But the pragmatic answer is that the United States is not going to be fully safe from COVID-19 until all countries are protected. And when we have a situation like we have now where there are deep discrepancies in which countries have access to vaccines and how much, it really does call for countries to share some of what they have, particularly countries like the United States that have much more than many, many other countries. Dr. Jennifer Nazo, thank you very much. Thanks so much."
Coronavirus mRNA Vaccine Safety and Efficacy,JAMA Network,2021-02-19,OvPg6PMI-q0,"In December 2020, the FDA authorized two coronavirus vaccines, both with unexpectedly high efficacy. Let's look at what we know about these vaccines and what we have yet to find out. The first vaccine to be authorized was developed by Pfizer and Biontech, and the Moderna vaccine was authorized a week later. Both are messenger RNA or mRNA vaccines. They work by inducing an immune response to the viral spike proteins. These are the proteins that stud the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and make it look crown-like, which incidentally is where the coronavirus gets its name. You can think of the vaccines as target practice for your immune system, the target being the spike. But instead of the actual spike proteins, these vaccines contain the genetic information in the form of mRNA that codes for the spike. When the vaccine mRNA enters the cells in your body, it gets taken up by the machinery of those cells, which then make the spike proteins. So we're basically just using the machinery of the cells to produce spike protein and put it in the surface of the cells so the immune system can then come and see the spike protein and then generate an immune response. This immune response to the spike would help you fight a future infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Importantly, the vaccine mRNA does not enter the cell nucleus, which contains the cells DNA. So the vaccine has no effect on DNA or body genetics. The vaccine mRNA also does not replicate, and it does not stick around permanently. The mRNA disappears, it goes away, so it doesn't even stay in the cytoplasm of the cells. This is what the cells normally do, mRNA in our cells disappears after a forms of proteins. Data suggests the highest levels of spike protein are produced 48 hours after vaccination and are cleared by 72 hours. The mRNA is actually gone even sooner by 24 hours. Now let's look at the data on efficacy. The overall efficacy for these vaccines was determined by comparing the number of people who developed symptomatic COVID-19 in the vaccine and placebo groups in large phase 3 trials. Here are the numbers for Pfizer and for Moderna. So how do you calculate efficacy? Let's look at Pfizer. First, you divide the cumulative incidence of disease in the vaccine group by the cumulative incidence in the placebo group. This gets you the risk ratio. Then you subtract the risk ratio from one and the number you come up with is the efficacy. So the efficacy for Pfizer is 0.95 or 95 percent. Here again are the numbers for Moderna. Using the same calculation gets you an efficacy of 94 percent. These numbers are encouraging, but it's important to keep in mind that participants in both the Pfizer and Moderna trials were tested only if they developed symptoms of COVID-19. So while these data tell us if these vaccines prevent clinically recognizable disease, they do not tell us if the vaccines also prevent infection and transmission of the virus, which means a few possible scenarios could be at work for those who are vaccinated. So a typical scenario could be a that someone is protected against infection and certainly against infection against clinically recognizable disease. But there's also a likely scenario where someone was protected against clinically recognizable disease, but they still have replication, competent virus and the nasopharynx. Hence, by definition, they are infected. And if that second scenario is at play with these vaccines, that is that people who are vaccinated don't develop symptoms but still get infected, a follow-up question is whether these vaccines might still prevent or at least they are infected? So if they prevent or at least decrease transmission, according to Dr. Fauci, it is conceivable that the immune response that protects someone from symptomatic COVID-19 would also lower the amount of virus in the nasopharynx. So you could be infected, but not have enough virus in your nasopharynx to transmit it? It's already underway to figure out whether these vaccines prevent infection and transmission as well as symptomatic COVID-19. Some very preliminary data indicate that they do and more data are expected soon. But given the uncertainty, public health authorities are recommending continued preventive measures like mask wearing and physical distancing, even for people who have been vaccinated. And there are other unknowns when it comes to efficacy that are still being researched, like the duration of immunity, whether the new virus strains could make the vaccines less effective or how efficacy varies for different demographic groups. Now let's look at safety. The FDA would normally want to see at least two years of safety follow-up data for a vaccine. But given the urgency of making an effective vaccine available for pandemic control, when these vaccines were authorized for emergency use, only about six months of follow-up data were available for the earliest participants, and two months for the Phase 3 trial participants. According to that data, the most common reactions were pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache, most often after the second dose. Most adverse events were mild to moderate and resolved within a few days. Such reactions are to be expected with all vaccines, and are most often just a sign of the immune system working. Importantly, even though these vaccines have already been authorized, safety monitoring is ongoing. Safety considerations go well beyond the clinical trial. There's observation of potential adverse events, well into the implementation of the vaccine distribution. So if you look at the numbers of people in the clinical trial, there were 44,000 in the Pfizer trial. Once you push the button and start distributing vaccines, you're going to be giving it to millions of people. And you're only going to find out a rare serious adverse event post-approval. That's definitely true. That's always true. But the good news is, their systems in place like the vaccine, safety data, link, or bears, or the CIS system to pick that up. These are government systems designed to detect post-approval safety signals, and the US has ramped up its safety surveillance capabilities for COVID-19 vaccines. An example of these systems at work is the recent publication by the CDC of data on severe allergic reactions, also called anaphylactic reactions. The US got a heads up about anaphylactic reactions after two cases were reported in the UK on December 9th. A CDC analysis published in JAMA reports on more than 9 million administered doses of the Pfizer vaccine and more than 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine. The rate of anaphylactic reactions was 4.7 cases per million doses for the Pfizer vaccine, and 2.5 cases per million doses for the Moderna vaccine. This is slightly higher than the rate of anaphylactic reactions following flu vaccination, for example, but still extremely rare. Two months into the vaccine rollout, both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine still appear to be safe. It's amazing. Here you have a virus that is elusive, difficult to characterize virus. It's had a number of clinical surprises and pathological surprises, which are meeting with a technology messenger RNA vaccines, with which we have no commercial experience. I was worried that there might have been something unpleasant that we were going to find out eventually that we wish we knew now, but for right now, no. The risk element, and why consider the father of modern vaccines, said it best, quote, I never breathe a sigh of relief until the first three million doses are out there. Well, the first three million dose are out there, the first 40 million dose are out there in the US, and hundreds of millions of doses are out there in the world. FDA and CDC scientists and others are continuing to watch safety and efficacy signals vigilantly, as more and more people get their doses. Continuing research should help us answer key remaining questions. And some of the uncertainty is the byproduct of getting too remarkably effective vaccines to the public within just 11 months of the virus being sequenced. I think it's reasonable to be vaccine hesitant. I think, you know, it's a frightening virus. A lot of the language that's surrounded the development was a little scary in our operation warp speed, race for a vaccine. Who's going to be the first to cross the finish line? That's a little scary. And it's a novel technology. I mean, I think you reasonably could say, wait, let me just see how this plays out initially. Well, it has played out. I mean, once 40 million people have been vaccinated, I think you now have a large platform in which to stand that you can say the effectiveness is remarkable. And the safety as far as we know appears to be reassuring. I think we're all vaccine skeptics. I think everybody who sits around the FDA vaccine advisory committee table is a vaccine skeptic. You want to see the data. Well, now you have the data. If you would like to see more content like this, please subscribe to our channel.

Comparing Johnson & Johnson Vaccine to Pfizer And Moderna | NBC News NOW,NBC News,2021-03-05,dhec1MOhOck,"The first 4 million doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine are now rolling out across the country. Because this is a single dose vaccine, it gives vaccination sites the ability to put more shots in the arms of Americans. The FDA says this vaccine is highly effective, but it is different from other shots on the market. That's leaving people with a lot of questions. Let's dive into a vaccine fact check, joining us now is NBC News Medical Reporter Erica. Edwards, Erica Good to have you. So, many are asking questions about the efficacy of the J and J vaccine. It is a total efficacy of 72 percent. Pfizer and Moderna are more than 90 percent effective each. Now, it's important to know the vaccines are not tested against each other. They were also tested at different times, but tell us more about why the numbers don't tell the whole story here. Good morning, Joe. Yeah, let's take a look at that 72 percent number because I think that's the sticking point for a lot of people. And Johnson and Johnson looked at the efficacy overall of its vaccine. It used a really broad definition, preventing anything from fever and headaches to trouble breathing. So, in that case, it was 72 percent effective against preventing those types of symptoms. Now, let's push that aside for a second. Here's where we really can compare apples to apples. All three of these vaccines prevented 100 percent of what we really worry about, hospitalizations and sadly death. Joe. So, let's talk about what's in the vaccines. The Archdiocese of New Orleans is urging parishioners not to take the vaccine, calling it, quote, morally compromise because of its links to cells that were derived from tissue from aborted fetuses. The statement is a departure from the Vatican, which said it was morally acceptable for Catholics to get any vaccine. Can you explain what is in this vaccine and how it's made? Yeah, let's break this down for folks. So, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, as well as many other vaccines on the market, polio, chicken pox, they were tested and developed using fetal cells from several decades ago. Now, here's why. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses an inactivated, harmless virus that would normally cause the common cold. They build it with instructions for the body to recognize the coronavirus if the reverend affected and then fight it off. Now, you need a lot of that virus in order to make this vaccine. So, to get enough of those virus, the best and fastest way to replicate it is to grow it inside human cells. And that's why those cells are used. However, in the end product, none of the vaccines do contain those fetal cells. Can you, Erica, how do the side effects for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine compare to Pfizer's and Moderna's? You may remember that Pfizer and Moderna had some rare cases of anaphylaxis that's a really severe form of an allergic reaction. So far, we have not seen any of those cases with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. There are some side effects. Most people about half people, the people complain about pain at the injection site, headache, fever, fatigue, muscle pain, things like that. Otherwise, no reports of anaphylaxis with Johnson & Johnson, Joe. All right, Erica Edwards, with a very helpful fact check this morning. Thank you so much.

Pfizer vs. Moderna - Vaccine Comparison,Dr. Mitch Rice,2021-05-02,gjstf5GrKO8,"Hello friends, it's Dr. Rice back with another COVID video and today we're going to be talking all about the differences between the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines. These vaccines are very similar, so I'm going to spend a little bit of time discussing the similarities and spend most of our time talking about their differences. The three main similarities between the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines that I'm sure you're all very familiar with by now is that they both require two shots. They both have similar efficacy rates of 95 and 94 percent respectively and they provide immunity using the same mechanism. That is, they're both mRNA vaccines. If you'd like to know more information about what exactly an mRNA vaccine is and how it works, I'll put a link to that video here in the top corner as well as down in the description. Another important similarity is that recent studies have now shown that both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines have similar efficacy rates in providing protection against three of the major known variants. These are the New York City variant, the South African variant, and the UK variant. New studies are being continuously performed on these variants every single day, so stay tuned for future content. Now onto the two major differences that are always brought up concerning the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines are storage as well as the length of time between the second dose administration. Pfizer must be stored in significantly colder temperatures than Moderna and this usually ranges from about negative 112 to negative 76 degrees Fahrenheit. The Moderna vaccine can be stored in regular refrigerator temperatures and this is around 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine is administered about 21 days after the first dose, whereas with the Moderna vaccine, it's administered about 28 days later after the first dose. However, the CDC did release a statement a while back stating that anyone who received the first dose of either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccines are eligible for the second dose within six weeks of the first dose. So in both instances, you have a six week time frame to get that second shot. Now let's talk about some lesser known differences between these two vaccines because that's what this video is really all about. First, we'll start with efficacy rates. As we talked about before, the overall efficacy rates for the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines are about 95 percent and 94 percent respectively. Now according to each of their clinical trials, the 95 percent efficacy rate for the Pfizer vaccine will kick in about seven days after the administration of the second dose and for the Moderna vaccine, it doesn't kick into about 14 days after the administration of the second dose. In other words, for the Pfizer vaccine, you become fully immune about seven days after the administration of the second dose. And for the Moderna vaccine, it takes about a full 14 days after you receive the second dose before you become fully immune. Both vaccines have a hundred percent efficacy rate in preventing death from COVID-19. And Pfizer has a hundred percent efficacy rate in preventing COVID-related hospitalizations and Moderna is about 90 percent. According to various studies and other sources, there's been speculation as to how well the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines do in preventing asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, meaning that you have COVID-19, but it doesn't actually cause any noticeable symptoms. Pfizer is speculated to have about 90 percent efficacy, whereas Moderna is speculated to have about 66 percent efficacy. Again, this is for preventing COVID-19 in the asymptomatic individual. However, this data is less concrete than the data found within their respective clinical trials. Now, let's talk a little bit about administration of the vaccine. Pfizer's vaccine has only about 30 micrograms of the actual vaccine content going into your body, whereas the Moderna vaccine has about a hundred micrograms over three times the amount of the Pfizer vaccine. However, the Pfizer vaccine has to be diluted with saline before it is injected. And so it would appear that the Pfizer vaccine's content is about the same as Moderna's, but in reality, it's only 30 micrograms versus Moderna's 100 micrograms. And lastly, we'll talk about the target population for these two vaccines. Both vaccines are currently undergoing trials to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of these vaccines in younger individuals. For now, Pfizer has approved for individuals aged 16 and older, whereas Moderna is approved for individuals aged 18 or older. Also, if you have questions about which vaccine you should get, I went into more depth on this topic in another video. So I'll put a link to that video here in the top corner, as well as in the description below. If you found this video helpful, please smash that like button, hit subscribe, as well as write a comment down below on which COVID topic you'd like me to cover next. As always, thank you so much for sticking with me to the end of this video, and I will see you all on the next one."
How long does Pfizer’s and Moderna’s efficacy last?,Good Morning America,2021-02-25,kcsmX--bLOw,"Okay, as in here, answer your questions. Let's start question number one, who here doc, what do we have? Let's see, is there any updated information about how long Pfizer's and Moderna's efficacy lasts? None that's been released in a widespread or massively public manner, but just let's go back to last year when they started these phase three clinical trials mid-summer. They got about two months of data, ongoing follow-up, obviously, for at least two years. And then they crunched and analyzed that data to submit to the FDA for authorization. So again, we are going to be following it. The six-month mark at the nine-month mark and so on up to two years. Right now, the immune protection or so-called durability looks pretty good. I have not actually heard this before. Someone says, all my life, my mom told me that drinking ice cold beverages is bad for digestion and heart health. Is there any science to this or did mama just make this up? My mother submitted this, she's a retired nurse. No, I'm just kidding. No science to this, but if you look at Ayurvedic Medicine, which comes from India, they really are big proponents of drinking room temperature beverages. I will tell you from a medical standpoint, our bodies are pretty sophisticated machines and we can adjust temperature pretty quickly, but if it bothers you or my mother, then don't do it. And then, you know, the American is like our ice, right? I'm like me too. I'm with you. I like ice cold. All right, Dr. Ashton, thank you so much.

"Higher Number Of COVID Vax Received, Higher RISK Of COVID: Newly Peer Reviewed Study Implies",The Hill,2023-05-30,eFx-d0SvOVg,"A newly peer reviewed study from the Cleveland Clinic found that the risk of COVID-19 varied by the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses previously received and the higher the number of vaccines previously received, the higher the risk of contracting COVID-19. Popular YouTuber and comedian who has been a prominent skeptic over vaccines and mandates throughout the pandemic, Jimmy Doar, tweeted, FYI, it's not a vaccine, it's a failed experiment, we are the guinea pigs. All right, tapies finding with the grant of salt. But this is interesting because this first came out earlier this year, I think, around February and there was a lot of pushback at that time. Part of the pushback was that it was not a peer reviewed study. It was just what's known as a preprint. Now, we're talking about this again because it has been peer reviewed and the parts of the study that raised a red flag to some vaccine skeptics are still there in the study. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, so the authors of the study note that this is unexpected. I don't think these are people who are, these are not like anti-vaccine people who are setting out to disprove the efficacy of vaccines. So they're saying there was an association of increased risk of COVID-19 with higher number of prior vaccine doses. And it was not because, so you could rationalize why that might be the case. Well, maybe people who are getting the most jabs, the most doses of vaccine are people who are older and higher at risk anyway. So then, yes, they're more likely to get COVID because they're higher risk. So it would just be incidental. They're more likely to get a lot of vaccines and they're more likely to get COVID, but that's not what doesn't have anything to do with the other. However, that is not the case here as they lay out of the clinic. They're like, okay, we see why you might think that. Most of the people in this study were young people. Some young people can be at a high risk of COVID if you have a preexisting condition, but you would not expect that to be most of the people. And so they're saying that that really makes this finding unexpected. Yeah. The risk of, yeah, despite this, their risk of acquiring COVID-19, the people who had fewer injections, was lower than those who received a larger number of prior vaccine doses. So it's worth noting that the overall conclusions of the study is that the vaccines do work. The by-dailant vaccines did work to lower the incidence of COVID, right? They work, but the study is not saying that and that ultimate conclusion should be taken into account. The question is whether at a certain point requiring or suggesting that people get multiple vaccines at a certain point, whether they're as diminishing returns. So there's, we should distinguish between getting a vaccine or incrementally boosted versus a certain volume that seems to have an unexpected effect. The paper also notes that this is not the only study to find a possible association with more prior vaccine doses and higher risk of COVID-19. During an Omicron wave in Iceland, individuals who had previously received two or more doses were found to have a higher odds of reinfection than those who had received fewer than two doses of vaccine and an unadjusted analysis. And it goes through some kind of technical scientific reasons why this might be happening, something called immune imprinting and some stuff with the spike protein that I think is beyond the technical know-how of us here. But it is being interpreted as validating some concerns as an anecdotal evidence that people have had that folks in their lives who got more vaccinations and more boosts seem to have succumb to the virus more frequently than those people who only maybe got the first round or what happened. Again, I could see for a very at-risk population of the elderly, you might say, well, even if this is increasing the chance you get COVID, honestly, the odds of getting, you know, when a wave comes through, you have good odds of getting it anyway, you want, if you're an elderly person or immunocompromised person, the protection from the dose is more important than some slightly increased odds that you would get it in the first place, the odds being that you were going to get it anyway. However, to repeatedly boost younger people who are healthy otherwise over and over again, they might be saying, well, if I get it, I get it, but I'd rather not increase my risk of getting it because if I get it, I'm probably going to not have such a bad time. And maybe you were vaccinated originally and we're just talking about subsequent doses or maybe you had it before. To actually, in this paper, it does say that the multivariate analysis also found the more recent, the last prior COVID episode, the lower risk of COVID, saying, again, that's the, you know, some kind of enduring natural immunity. And I just keep thinking how the places in our society that are still trying to take this decision away from individuals like university campuses where the bivalent sum of them is going to be required still in the fall, that, like, how naive and unscientific it is to take that decision out of people and their doctors, and then also the kind of, the attempts to suppress criticism of vaccines, you know, calling it all misinformation that has occurred online and elsewhere for the last three years. Well, I guess. So short-sighted. So a couple of things. First, it should be noted that this was an unexpected observation in this study and they, in the study, say that it needs to be said further. So that is, you know, it's, we, I wouldn't draw too many hard and fast conclusions, although I take Jimmy Doris' point, that it does feel like if there is, in fact, a negative result, like making people more vulnerable to getting COVID and they're just saying, well, shit, I studied this more. I can understand people feeling like they are getting pigs in this situation, right? That there should have been more of this kind of research that happened earlier, but there was a real hesitancy to do so when we were in the throes of the pandemic. But it's also worth noting that the objective or the biggest gain of getting vaccinated, we've now known for a long time, is preventing hospitalization. So this study is talking about whether or not people are more susceptible to actions coming to the virus, but there's a whole separate conversation about whether or not it's preventing you from having the worst outcomes here. So for young people who already tend not to have the worst outcomes, I think that's a really interesting question that you're raising about college campuses and the like. For even older people, there could be a calculation that says, sure, you might be this percent more likely to catch COVID than you might not have if you had gotten multiple boosters. But if you hadn't gotten boasted, you might end up in the hospital or be more likely to die. So it's better just to basically like take on more softer waves than to wait for the one big one to take you out. But this is yet more or this is another point of data in the column of the group of people for which it is least justifiable. If you think it's justifiable at all to require them to get vaccinated is actually the population where the requirements were most likely school age populations. Sure. And that's just that's so people are going to feel I think so gaslit about all this stuff saying, again, the initial promise may be implicitly I guess, but a lot of people in the media reported it was that every has to get vaccinated. We're really encouraging it where we're not requiring an outright. We're encouraging it because this is how we're going to stop the spread and we're going to get rid of COVID because we're going to have herd immunity because you're no longer going to be able to transmit it or get it when you're vaccinated. That didn't pan out and like on and on and on and on and on. Yeah, that's absolutely. I understand that they are the findings are still that they're very protective against severe disease and death for at risk populations. But the logic of the requirements was really for the public health rationale was really on stopping cases. Yeah, I totally give that and I agree that that was the rationale, but it hasn't been now for some time. Yeah. Just think from a public health perspective as people are considering these kind of studies, it's important to really emphasize that the goal, the stated goal for some time now, has been to prevent hospitalization and death and that vaccines, including this study, show that there is a significant benefit when the vaccine is correlated to the strain that's happening, it does effectively lower hospitalization and death here. Right. But again, you could have a more targeted, even based on this study, you could say, are you in this risk category? Yeah, look at this study, you would benefit from vaccination on net, you would benefit because even if you're increasing your likelihood of getting COVID, the protection is important versus your disease and death. You are in this categorization, you're a healthy young person and really all you're doing by getting your fifth or something dose is making it slightly more likely you're going to get COVID or whatever it is. And that doesn't make as much sense for you. And we have not had that approach at all. And people are going to feel anything just, a valuable outrage. And I think that people like Jimmy Doar, who are saying, well, where was all this research? Why hasn't there been more research about what's going on with COVID? I think are completely right. And I think there also needs to be a sensitivity to and frustration about the lack of research with respect to long COVID as well. Whatever you think about it, whether or not it's credible or whether you're skeptical about how real it is as a phenomenon, the reality is that we are out of ignorance about what's going on, allowing the government to basically ratchet back any protections, any long-term healthcare support for people with long COVID, any way to protect themselves against it, and also insulating the manufacturers of vaccines from any liability. There's a whole mixed bag of shielding that's happening for people who are going to have that outcomes one way or the other. And I do think that before we are overly interested in saying, well, I don't think that long COVID is a thing because it's being used as a pretext for the government to have overreach. Also downplaying the possibility of long COVID having this effect as being used as an excuse for the government to not have any responsibility for policies that may have set up a significant portion of the American public to be dealing with a crisis, a health crisis, where we don't have universal healthcare long after the government has washed its hands of all of it. Well, as you know, I remain extremely skeptical of a lot of long COVID claims. However, if, and I don't know what- Well, it should be studied. I mean, that's a thing. And I don't really know what people who are very worried about long COVID, I'm not sure what the state of their claims are with respect to, like, is it worse if you've gotten in more COVID more times, or is it- Is it correlated with the severity of the infection? So if you've gotten it, if you get COVID a bunch of times, but none of them are severe, you're not going to get- No, it's also correlated with the numbers of times- Well, that's what I'm getting at. So a vaccine that makes you, if you're getting a population where you're not at severe risk of- It's going to make you more likely to get it, maybe from a long COVID perspective. That is- Well, that kind of cuts both ways, but that's why I agree with everyone who's looking for- More research and more studies, and I do think there is a real issue with there being so much delay here, and getting some of this kind of information out. Well, we'll have more rising right after this."
"Coronavirus vaccine: Moderna CEO talks phase 3 of vaccine development, human trials and efficacy",Yahoo Finance,2020-07-27,9FcROwPyuHU,"Moderna is one of the top trending stocks on the Yahoo Finance site this morning, up nearly 9 percent here in the pre-market. On news that it has entered into the phase 3 trial of its COVID-19 vaccine. Now this means it's going to start to give participants doses. The trial is expected to enroll up to 30,000 people. It's being conducted in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. For more now, we are joined by the CEO of Moderna, Stefan Bansel, as well as Yahoo Finance as Health Reporter, Angelique Kamlani. Good morning to you both and Stefan. Thanks for being with us this morning. What do you hope these results in phase 3 will yield? Will it mean that this vaccine is safe to be used perhaps in the next few months? Yes, good morning and thank you again for having me. So indeed, the phase 3 for a vaccine is a typical last clinical trial. It's a very large one, you know, 30,000 people. 15,000 we received the vaccine. 15,000 we received placebo. And we're going to be able to see through the data. What's the safety of a vaccine? So it's a very large database of safety. And what is efficacy of a vaccine? The FDA has set about 50 percent efficacy. So it's very clear for everybody what has to be achieved. And what we started to do this morning is to those participants in several states in the US. We have up to around 100 clinical sites set up mostly where we have a lot of infections right now. And so what we're hoping is potentially as early as October, maybe in November, it's difficult to anticipate the infection rate. But given the high infection rate in the seven states right now, it is possible that we have data of efficacy in October or November. So, that's very exciting news, especially when we're looking for at least some indication that a vaccine will come to light. Obviously, Moderna ahead of the scale there. But looking at the funding part of it, you got an additional 472 million from Barta to help with this trial without that you wouldn't be able to do as robust a trial, correct? That's correct. If you look at back in April, when we got the first Barta grant for $483 million, at the time, we were thinking of a trial of 10,000 participants. And then through the spring, as we discussed with the FDA and the NIH Dr. Fauci's team, it became apparent that given the exposure of a US citizen that could happen within a pro-vaccine, to ensure safety, which of course is very important for the FDA and for a sponsor company like Moderna, that 30,000 was the right size to do the clinical trial. And so, as you can imagine, it was much more expensive to run the 30,000 trial than 10,000. And so the supplements that were signed over the weekend is actually enabled us to do and to fund entirely the 30,000 trial participants. And so, with all of that going on, you also have so much when it comes to interest from investors and interest from a lot of different avenues. We know that even Launza has been approached by other companies to try and help with their productions. They have a lot going on right now. For a company that is really in the limelight right now, are there any things that you have maybe seen as lessons learned or anything that has occurred that you're really taking that lesson forward with you right now? I mean, the piece, if you ask me, that I've been the most surprised and impressed through the last six months, because we started erasing these virus back in January in the first days of January, is the extraordinary collaboration from the US government, you know, with Dr. Farchis team, with the FDA, sometimes we have you know, two or three dialogue in the same day. Everybody has been coming together to help fight these virus. And you know, I've been in this business for 25 years. I've never seen this level of cooperation, collaboration and dialogue that has allowed us to move so fast without ever compromising safety. That has been very important for everybody. We have taken a lot of business risk. So we spend a lot of money at risk, sometimes modern as shoulder money, sometimes taxpayer money for brother to take a lot of risk. I mean, think about it now, where we've raised $1.3 billion in May to start making the vaccine at risk. So as we speak, we have our teams at Moderna and the team at Launza that are making vaccine for commercial use. We don't have a phase three data. We just have it a phase three today. So it just tells you the extraordinary effort the industry and the governments are doing together. So that either vaccine works, which we should know in a poll, we can make it available for millions and millions of Americans right away. Stefan, I did want to ask you about your some of your stock sales. 72,000 shares sold through July 16th. I understand a lot of these sales were pre-arranged, but what do you tell lawmakers down in DC who are criticizing sales like this and saying, you know what, Moderna and many other biotech companies are profiting off the pandemic? Yes, so those sales were done through 10 B5 plans. I can't talk personally. I mean, those plans were initially set up in December 2018 when we went public. We had put, because I wanted to be very careful to invest or we had put a 12 month burn, which the sales could not happen for the first 12 months. And so by policy, those plans actually not cancelable now. We are in a blackout period of a company. And because of that, nobody can start a new plan, can amend the plan or can stop a plan that is against policy. Because as you know, when the SEC set up those plans, they did that, you know, years ago, so that executives could not benefit from insider information. And so, even there's so much data like our non-human primate, more key data that not being public, the data in the elderly is not available yet to the public. So we only sell stocks through plans that was set up a long time ago when none of us even knew what SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 was. Stefan, just to follow up on that, you know, it's commonplace for those plans to be amended over time. Can you share with us the last time those stock plans were amended for your company? And do you have any plans or are you free to buy any more stock in Moderna in the near term? So because of a blackout period we are in, I cannot change a plan to buy or to sell stock. All those things are forbidden to me or to any of the executives or board members. What I can tell you is that, you know, 99 percent of my wealth is tied up in the Moderna stock. So I'm very aligned with any of our shareholders. And if you also look at it, because of the stock options that have been awarded to me by the board over the years, actually despite the stocks that my plans have sold earlier this year, I had more stock in June 30th than I had on January 1st. So if you look at it, this was just a bit of liquidity that I set up at the time of the IPO, because another company has been private for nine years. I actually was the only investor in the world that has both stock with cash at the same terms of any other investor in every of a private round. The around, the beer round, the beer round, the beer round, the beer round, the beer round, and the beer round, I was talking every round. And so if any investors is worried they're not aligned with me, they should look at the numbers. So we are extremely aligned. Stepan, one final question for you. Looking at the way that a lot of the larger sort of vaccine legacy companies are acting, saying pretty loudly that, you know, vaccines aren't typically a profitable avenue, that going to be possibly your first product out on the market. And all of this rush, really of support behind it, does that play a role in how you plan to price because there's so much taxpayer money, you've got a lot of investment. How does that answer the question of, you know, pricing and going forward with the provision of vaccine doses? Yes, that's a great question. And that's one that we're spending a lot of time thinking about trying to be very balanced and very responsible. We have seen before, we have to make a profit out of the first product we sold because we have invested two billion dollars of our shareholder capital since we started the company. The company has never made a profit. And as I said, we raise another 1.3 billion dollar of equity capital in May that is going to make product at risk, assuming the product is successful. And so we need to get a return. We are highly aware that this is a pandemic and that we need to be very, very responsible how we price the product. We've said before, we will price the product within the range of vaccines already approved. And we're going to be most probably provide a discount for the pandemic phase. As Dr. Fauci has said, this virus is not going away. So we believe there will be a market in the endemic phase in a couple of years when the pandemic is over. But for the pandemic phase, the healthcare crisis we're all facing right now will provide a discount to the selling price. And we're trying to be very, very careful and sensitive about it because it's very important that everybody who wants a vaccine is able to afford the vaccine. That's very important to all of us at the company."
How Moderna And Pfizer-BioNTech Developed Vaccines In Record Time,CNBC,2021-08-27,K7SXqkCb1k4,"Let's start with the tumble. In the Chinese market, his new fears of the coronavirus of the coronavirus has some breaking news from the CDC. Hey, well, the CDC has confirmed the first patient in the U.S. diagnosed with this novel coronavirus, a man in Washington, stayed recently returned from Wuhan, China, where this outbreak has been going on since last month. The piece that I think very worried me a lot is that he was already everywhere, that the death rate was going up very drastically, very steeply in January in China. And Belsi was trying to figure out just how this virus will disrupt travel to what extent and if it will also result in Chinese consumers pulling back from making purchases. I don't think anyone of us knew what it would at the end do. We will begin in China, the latest on the coronavirus, where the total number of confirmed cases worldwide is now exceeding 60,000. It was alarming to understand or to feel at least that we were in this alone for so long. Biotech company Moderna stocks soaring this week on news that delivered the first batch of its potential vaccine. We see, look, it's a good opportunity to try to help and try to see how fast we can grow. Pfizer and Moderna were in this and they were both driving really hard toward a goal that had never been accomplished before. It's nice to have people following your footsteps. It's uncomfortable to have people following your footsteps. You can't be concerned about what others are doing. The U.S. death toll now stands at 14. There's the circuit breaker. 2549, 48 and the bell. So we'll wait here. We calculated that we could come up with enough weeks with a number of vaccine candidates. Frankly, I didn't know that it would work until the last, last moment, until November 8th. Breaking news from Pfizer this morning about its vaccine and a 90 percent efficacy. What we're doing isn't playing in a sandbox trying to demonstrate our technology. We're developing the vaccine that's going to stop the pandemic. When you are forced to do something because failure is not an option, you find solutions. This is D-Day. This is the turning point when we really fight back against COVID. As everybody is rooting both of these companies on, it's also this fascinating dynamic of a David versus Goliath trying to save the world. So I was actually in France. It was just between Christmas 2019 and New Year. And I was reading the journal like every morning. And I read about the new infectious disease agent, pneumonia, laxium, tome in China. And they didn't know what it was. I remember waking up the first week in January. It was really cold. I get up really, really, it's dark in New England. And I was sitting by our gas fireplace with a cup of coffee, like 4.30 in the morning. And Stefan had sent four emails over the course of an hour. I received an email from our CEO, Stefan, who had been exchanging emails with Barney Graham at the Vaccine Research Center, part of NIAD. I literally double-click on my own button on my iPad and send an email to my team to say what is this. In Classics, if I'm way, it was like one letter, you know. It was like, we should pay attention to this. There's something happening here. And then forwarding links or forwarding text that he'd gotten from France. I was in Los Angeles at the end of January. I didn't feel comfortable, to be honest. I mean, even traveling, I, you know, there were then news that the virus was also appearing in other places. And shortly thereafter, I mean, my husband and I, we really were like hermits in our apartment. We wouldn't go out anymore, you know, in stores or anything other than walking the dog. The big aha moment was I was traveling in Europe and I was in my home country to speak to a global economic forum, the Delphi economic forum. That's a very big deal for Greece. And I arrived two days before the conference so that I can attend it in person. The Prime Minister was going to attend. Then the day before I'm receiving a note, it's cancelled. The forum is cancelled. That has never happened before. It was in January, on January 24th. I was just back from the United States and it was a Friday evening. And I was reading a Lancet paper which was the first publication describing this outbreak in China. It only started to pay attention after Guazahi. My husband came up with a Lancet publication. I did a number of calculations, fast calculations and realized that the virus had already spread worldwide and it was clear that it is already too late to stop the disease and that we are most likely running into a global outbreak of pandemic. The CDC now confirming one case of the coronavirus in the United States and the Dow taking a hit in today on that news. Meg Trel joins us now with more on this developing story. This is fascinating. Great. Developing and developing very quickly as of this morning we were just hearing about mounting case numbers in China and other nearby countries. More than 300 there and six confirmed deaths so far. They are waiting any minute for word from the World Health Organization after it is convened an emergency committee meeting to determine whether to declare this a public health emergency of international concern. This would be just the sixth time they have declared such an international health emergency after declaring it about Ebola twice before H1N1 swine flu, Zika. So the CDC started covering COVID probably in late January. And by then the companies were already starting to work on vaccines and potential drugs for this. By the time the world woke up to the threat of what was happening in China these companies were already working. So that was a lot of our early work was A, just trying to decipher the news that was coming out of China. But B, already trying to triangulate and figure out what the pharmaceutical industry was doing. And as it happened it was pretty early but they were already doing quite a lot. At the time when we believe it's an outbreak we say look it's a good opportunity to try to help and try to see how fast we can go. Because we would always believe them on it could go really fast. Between never had a test case to do it. Moderna was not a small company. I mean it had a multi billion dollar market value when it went into this but it had never proved itself with a vaccine that had reached the market. It was this very sort of cheeky bold biotech that made a lot of big statements about how this technology that most people knew nothing about called mRNA was going to change medicine change the world. We hadn't seen that proven out yet. Moderna therapeutics, a biotech that uses your cells to develop treatments for previously incurable diseases and to speed up the pharmaceutical development process. Moderna's technology gives patients cells instructions to create proteins and antibodies to fight diseases from diabetes to certain types of cancer. What we do is we basically make the messenger RNA injected into you and your own ribosome is going to make your own protein. So you make your own drug. Early on talking with Stefan, he always seemed to exude this certainty that they could do it. That if it could be done with mRNA that they were going to be able to do it. The beauty of the technology is that we are able to develop a lot of drugs in parallel which is very atypical from biotech companies. And I remember meeting with him maybe five years ago or even longer at this business sludge in New York City and he brought their investor deck to me to show me the slides of what the possibilities of mRNA technology are. And he was just scrolling through the pages showing me it'll treat this disease. It can treat this disease. It can do vaccines. It can do rare diseases. Just showing me the scope of what was possible at the time. I was kind of like, okay, we'll see how this plays out. And that's how he is. I mean, the CEO of a company like that which raised so much money privately, he really had to prove to the world that they could do this and the pandemic gave him his chance. If you know Stefan, from the first email, things were starting to turn. And so from the very first week of January through a series of emails that I'd received, but he sent that the Hamilton, he sent them to our research team, sent them to manufacturing, even saying, hey, we've got to go get ready. And he was also actually quickly interacting with the folks at NIH and Barney Graham and his team. And so by the time we got to the actual sequence of the virus, people had all been keyed up to be ready to take that sequence, turn it into a vaccine and start manufacturing. And being about, that's really in just the first 10 days of January. We had previously worked on coronavirus as we knew what this might look like. And so when this happened, we said, if we know what this viral pneumonia is, it'll probably take us a couple of days to figure out what that antigen looks like. And we'll get it into phase one. And we can move very quickly into phase one. In best case, the pandemic subsides. It turns out to be a seasonal coronavirus and it disappears, but we've got a product into phase one. We've demonstrated proof of concept. And we can put the product on the shelf and if it re-emerges in the fall and it turns into a seasonal pathogen, we can pull it off the shelf and we can go conduct that larger clinical study. The sequence was published on January 11th. Up until then, nobody knew exactly what the virus was and certainly didn't know what part of the virus we'd want to make a vaccine to. And we thought it was going to be a coronavirus. Everybody believed it was a coronavirus. The spike protein was the right thing to do. But we got that information and then NIH in Moderna independently went off and said, okay, so we're going to design a vaccine. What would it be like? So they said this a sequence. I think it was probably that Tuesday after the sequence was published or the 14th, it was the same work that we had been looking at ourselves. It matched all of the conversations we had and we got that information and together said, well, let's go do this. Moderna, get busy manufacturing and NIH, get busy planning for the phase one study. In our bubble, we were all focused on this. But when you left work and you went to see your friends and you were talking with your family, you really weren't paying attention to it. And people seemed to think, well, it's not in the US yet. So we'll deal with it later. I think it was really eye-opening for a lot of people that our borders aren't going to keep out these viruses. A funny story is we had a grid in November of 2019 with Dr. Farchreet's team to do in the second quarter of 2020, pandemic, mock-up, together. But they were going to send us the sequence of a virus by email, pretending they're just sequence that new virus. And we're going to make the mRNA, GMP, I mean, to go into clinical testing. And then we're going to start the clockwork, see how fast we could go and send it back to them. And the reason in November, we decided not to do it in January is because they were too busy in Q1. So they said, can we do it in the spring or actually we'll do it in the spring? And then of course, we know the rest is history. We have a totally under control. It's one person coming in from China. And we have it under control. It's going to be just fine. Earlier today, I spoke with Stefan Benzel. He's the CEO of Moderna Therapeutics. This is a company that we listed as a CMBC Disruptor. No, no, Stefan. He told me that they are working with the NIH right now to try and develop a vaccine for this very issue. I go to Davos. And in Davos, I meet several times a day, two, in my opinion, amazing infectious disease doctors. This is Sir Jeremy Farrah, who runs the World of Controls. And Dr. Richard Hatchett, who runs CEPI. What's fascinating is they refresh my memory on biology of coronaviruses, incubation time and stuff like that. And then they start sharing with me anecdotes that they are getting from their infectious disease friends in China. And we start literally on the napkin as we run into Davos, you know, to map our notes and death rates. And we start to realize very early on that the R notes is very high. And I remember asking him, hey, remind me, coronaviruses in a 7 to 14 days incubation time, right? Yes. And like, where is Wuhan? So I get my iPad out, Google and my app where is Wuhan in a big city. And then we realize it's a big, auto-part industrial center. And then I get to Google, and I start to look at Google flights. And I start to realize that they are flights coming out of Wuhan to all the big capital in Asia or big capital in Europe. And the big cities in the West Coast of the US. And so I look back to them and say, it's everywhere, right? And the time here, it's by now, it's everywhere. And then that night, China locked down Wuhan. And I'm like, when is the last time I know a city has been locked down because of a new infectious disease? And what goes for my mind is what those Chinese know that we don't know. It took me, I think, another night or two. And I remember working up Saturday morning, sweating at 4 in the morning, seeing Jesus going to be a pandemic back in 1918. There was a lot of debating at that time. We're going to be back and forth. And in the way that we sometimes do, we take different positions. And I was definitely in the camp of, this is going to peter out. We're going to get under control. It's not going to explode. Stefan and others were definitely in the other camp, saying, no, this is a really big deal. The moment that clicked for me was actually watching China build a hospital in six days. We could probably all remember it. There's cranes in that field and all that digging. And I just remember thinking, what causes a government like that to act? Like that. We were still in this country seeing maybe our first case, maybe our first death, but it seemed like a very far away problem. I do remember that morning watching that video being, oh my God, this is going to explode. And as we've seen, those case numbers tick higher. We're also hearing from more pharmaceutical companies responding to the outbreak. Some are developing potential vaccines, including Moderna therapeutics, which is working with the NIH. Others are exploring development of new drugs like Regeneron and Veer biotechnology. Another approach is testing whether existing drugs might work against this novel coronavirus. So, biotech is run by two scientists who happen to be married to one another. And they recognize the threat of this virus early on and pivoted their company to start working on it. But it was sort of this small little known German company that was known to be working in cancer drugs using messenger RNA to try to fight cancer in this really cutting edge way. We have two major companies talking about using messenger RNA. And what that is is it actually delivers the genetic instructions to make a specific protein from the coronavirus to your body. Your body then makes that protein and your immune system learns how to recognize it. That's how mRNA vaccines worked. But because they've never been developed before for any product, there were a lot of people questioning if this was really the prudent way to go in a pandemic. But one of the beauties of it is it can be done so quickly. We knew that we have a technology, our personalized mRNA vaccine technology, where we can design very fast vaccines, genetically engineered vaccines. And we calculated that we could come up within a few weeks with a number of vaccine candidates. And we realized that we could be among the first companies. We informed our supervisory board. We discussed with our management board that we need to start a project and shift resources from the cancer research to the vaccine development pivot the company decided to call the project project blood speed, having the goal to develop a vaccine in the shortest possible time. I know him very well. For a long time and I know that he doesn't pry wolf without a clear rationale and reason to do so. It was about a stepwise process in which we would also observe how the environment would develop and how real the danger would get. We had at that time on already a collaboration with the colleagues from Pfizer about developing vaccines against influenza flu. We had the first contact with Pfizer a few days after starting the project. At that time, it was not yet interested. Not many believed at that point when we reached out that this would really become a pandemic. One of the biggest things people worried about at the beginning of this was that the drug supply would be interrupted because so much of the active ingredients that go into a lot of really critical drugs come from China. And so Pfizer was a key player in that. And what we heard from them at the beginning was just what they were doing to ensure that there was a continuous supply of critical medicines. In narrowed January, I was not focusing at all on COVID. I was only focusing on China. In late February, I started thinking that we need to do something. This is when I decided not only to treat them but also vaccine. I asked our team, I want to have a vaccine. What is the best approach you think? We were thinking about a protein-based vaccine. We were thinking about a vector vaccine. And they all had too few pros and too many cons and not understanding what this virus really needed in terms of how you protected against it. It was not given that we would go for mRNA. Actually, mRNA was the most counterintuitive decision because of all the choices. Because there was never a vaccine made with mRNA. So I wrestled a little bit with the decision. We had another meeting and they convinced me. And I said, yeah, let's take the risk. We go for mRNA. Clearly for me was very counterintuitive, but we said, let's go. UGAR, while we were doing all of that, called Catherine Jensen. UGAR called me and said, you know, we have those constructs. He has been working on this for a while. Five weeks later, I did a second call called Catherine Jensen. I'm told that we have no candy dates and that we are developing a vaccine. And at that time, the outbreak was already in New York. So it was very clear now, five weeks past that this is not only selected cases somewhere in Wuhan, but this is already an outbreak which had reached the United States and New York. And I asked Catherine, do you think that Pfizer would like to work with us? And I said, absolutely. Let's talk about this. We started working together before we even had an agreement in place. That was the beginning of, I believe, a great friendship in addition to partnership that I developed with UGAR. We went on the phone since that first phone call twice a week maybe. And we were discussing everything. This is what the relation was built in this atmosphere of trust and mutual respect. Pfizer comes in and it's this massive company, one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. If people know Pfizer, they probably know it for drugs like Lipitor and Viagra, not for cutting edge vaccines developed in a public health crisis. And yet it's massive. It operates all around the world. It has tremendous manufacturing capacity. It has tons of amazing scientists and they've got billions of dollars to work with. They jump into the pond and we're off to the races. The Dow is now down more than 1100 points. As moments ago, the WHO has formally declared the coronavirus a global pandemic. Breaking news, a global fell off underway as the 11 year bull market comes to an end. Stock futures pointing to heavy selling at the open. This as President Trump takes unprecedented action to help stem the spread of the coronavirus in the US. By late spring, early summer, it was clear that Pfizer and Moderna were in this and they were both driving really hard toward a goal that had never been accomplished before, developing this vaccine in record time, hopefully by the end of the year. And you had this situation where you had this brash biotech in Moderna, kind of the David to Pfizer's gargantuan goliath, one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. And so as everybody's rooting both of these companies on, it's also this fascinating dynamic of a David versus a goliath trying to save the world. It really parts to January. There were a lot of companies that were talking about this and even in February. And even going into March, there were voices that said vaccines were false hope. There were other voices that were more optimistic, but it did feel for a period of time that we needed to defend even the idea of trying and that it wasn't false hope and that we really thought we could scale and develop highly effective vaccines within a year. When we were thinking about how do we get into phase one, what does it look like to prepare for a pandemic? The eyes of the world felt as though they were looking at Moderna as this biotech of what are they doing over there? What are they trying to do? And it was only when we transitioned in that March notification from the WHO that this is a global pandemic. It's an emergency that I think people started to realize what we're doing isn't playing in a sandbox trying to demonstrate our technology. We're developing the vaccine that's going to stop the pandemic. It wasn't until May where we decided after we'd seen the first data from the phase one study and we'd seen what's happening for a public health perspective that not only do we need to make this the almost singular focus of the company from here on out. We got to go all in but actually we need to go back to investors and ask for their support and that's where we were able to raise a substantial amount of money, 1.3 billion dollars in May, that we put 100 percent in to solving this problem, scaling manufacturing. We always play the long game, focus on the science, put the cards down, swear whatever other people thought of us, didn't really change often, Kingo, how we felt about it. We just had to do a job which is try to make these science work because if we could, it was going to change medicine forever. Previously, the world record for developing a vaccine was four years. Most vaccines take longer than that develop even a decade or longer. So while we saw these companies doubling down and working at speeds we'd never seen before, we also saw the government do similar things in terms of providing billions of dollars in funding to some of these companies. Through a historic series of funding bills, my administration is providing roughly 10 billion dollars to support a medical research effort without parallel. Today I want to update you on the next stage of this momentous medical initiative. It's called Operation Warp Speed. But also changing the regulatory structure so that things that were previously done sequentially, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, manufacturing, were suddenly started to stack on top of each other. While the Phase 1 study was happening to test the initial safety and the muner action of the vaccines, they were planning Phase 2. While they were planning Phase 2, they were already starting to get things in place for Phase 3. And as all of this was happening, they were also starting to ramp up manufacturing to ensure before they even knew if we were going to have a vaccine that if they were successful, we would actually have vaccine doses ready to give to people. In the Spanish flu, there was a first wave but was lethal. But the second one that came in the fall was the one that really killed a lot of people. I had a strong belief that this thing would not go and in fall we're going to have a huge problem. So I said we need to have one by fall. And I said this is when I said the date by end of October. Putting really stringing rules, masking, social distancing and making sure that the people who had to come in were safe and it actually worked very, very well. We were able to start our first phase one study in just over 60 days, which is a month faster than we had initially planned. So there were kind of three of us that we called the Troika of this. It was myself, the head of infectious disease research and the head of technical development. When you get the three of us in a room, we can do anything. And so that was it. Every morning at 8.30, two of us would be in the office. The other would be walking into the office and we would have a call. That's our priority today. How did everything go yesterday? Can we pull in those timelines? And what do we need to do to get the clinical study up and going? As we got closer to phase one, as we started to think about continued development beyond that, our Troika just started to grow a little bit. We would pull in. We see members here or there and Stephen would join us or Stefan would join us. And then one, our head of manufacturing was gung-ho. All right, you're going to need capacity. I'm going to go find capacity for you. I truly believe that people, they don't know what they can and what they cannot do. And in most of the cases, they have the tendency to severely underestimate their capability. Until they are tested. And the ultimate test it is to give someone a goal that it is very important to achieve, for example, in this case, because human lives are at stake, and that force you to think completely different. All your focus, all your energy and everything goes on, what do we have to do, solving the problems as we go? It was just like non-stop. And I think with this focus, you almost block out reality because you just have no capacity to worry about it, it's about anything but to make it happen. Moderna saying in its phase one trial, it observed that after two doses, all patients in the trial developed antibodies to the virus. They observed what they call a dose-dependent response, meaning to hire the dose, the more the immune reaction that the vaccine elicited. Moderna, that's a Massachusetts biotech company, says preliminary data indicates eight out of 45 patients that they tested developed antibodies that neutralize the virus. Those may, when we first saw data from a few patients from Moderna's phase one study, and it was tremendously exciting because we didn't know if these mRNA vaccines were going to work, if they were going to do anything. It was the first glimmer that these vaccines were doing something and that they might be the solution. I remember waiting on pins and needles for that phase one data in the middle of May. I remember the night that it actually came over email to us in the middle, it was about 9 pm at night, was sent in from the folks at NIH who had access to the data first. Ripping through the figures and trying to get a sense of what happened, what happened, pretty raw data, and realizing with some elation that this actually worked. I mean, it really worked. We generated strong immune titers in everybody that got the vaccine. It was a little bit muted when you're isolated at home, when these big events occur. But I remember sitting at my computer late at night with an immunogenicity report coming in and everything is sent with password protected. So you get the report and then a couple minutes later you get the password that comes through and it's just staring at your inbox waiting for it to refresh. I know this type of guy will cry, but I drew it to Kapol T. I think more of relief because I know there's so much relying on that data being positive. And then being able to share that with the rest of the organization was great because there's a team of people that are working on this and the manufacturing colleagues, their research colleagues that are a little bit more removed from the phase one at that point, but have been investing in this for the six weeks. So it's really nice to be able to take that and share it back with the team and say, all of this hard work that you did for those six weeks in January and February, paying off. About an hour after that, there were phone calls and text flying around and everybody are congratulating each other some quite tearfully because it felt like we really had hope now. And I didn't realize it, but up until that moment, up until the middle of May, everything was just sort of without hope. We had this belief in the science, but we didn't have anything in our hands that suggested we were going to be able to help. And from the middle of May 4, we really believed M1A1273 was going to have an impact and it was up to us to deliver it. Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine phase one, two results. They just posted online on a pre-print server, meaning they've submitted it to a journal. They haven't yet been peer reviewed. But these results show in this early stage trial, looking at 24 patients on two lower doses of this vaccine, all 24 generated neutralizing antibodies. Those are the important ones that stop the virus from being able to infect cells. And they saw that at levels 1.8 to 2.8 times what you would see in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. That was a relief to see that we indeed get a strong antigen specific directed against the virus immune response. And I think we'll go at that time even said we have in terms of immune responses, we have an idea profile. We had an expectation of what good would look like. And we always used the immune response that we saw from individuals that got infected with SARS-CoV-2, kind of as our guidepost. And then when the data came in, the antibody data, the neutralizing antibody data, and also the T cell data, we said, wow, that's great. So we are doing actually better than what the virus does. So I think we have a good chance. Now, this is just the latest of the Operation Warp Speed deals that the government has made earlier in July 1.6 billion to Novavax, another big deal, $1.2 billion to ask for Zeneca. Those are a little bit different because they do support development and manufacturing of the vaccines as they are going through the process. Whereas the Pfizer deal is only if it gets through regulatory approval guys and gets onto the market. It's great to have you. This is a big day. The first phase three trial in the United States of a COVID-19 vaccine kicking off. So tell us about the timelines we should expect here. This is a 30,000 participant trial. How quickly do you think you can enroll that many participants and when will we see the data? Yes, good morning, Meg. Thank you for having us back. So indeed, it's a big day. It's a first phase three of a COVID vaccine in the US. It's a first phase three of an amount of medicine ever. And so companies, first phase three as well. So a big day. I looked at Moderna as another company with a similar technology and I was very clear that one company can not solve that problem by that time it became very clear. It didn't really occur to me that they were going to go after this particular pandemic. And I think it was even more surprising that Pfizer jumped in in the way that they did in April because they didn't have that experience. We did it based on our confidence, decade of work, and the fact we've done it many times before. Whereas those two companies had really never done it before. It was definitely a little looking over your shoulder or a little, you know, it's nice to have people following your footsteps. It's uncomfortable to have people following your footsteps. You can't be concerned about what others are doing. It's like you need to focus on what you need to do, right? It doesn't matter what somebody else announces or does because it doesn't help you. We started to adopt a mindset that it's going to take six, maybe seven different companies each able to manufacture enough doses for a billion people to end the pandemic. And we need to root for all of them to get in this fight because otherwise it was going to be really lonely and really difficult. That Pfizer saying that they plan on potentially starting a phase three as soon as later this month that puts them really neck and neck with Moderna and getting to that 30,000 participant late stage efficacy trial. Moderna also has fast track designation. Moderna's CEO, Cifan Bonsel, telling me last week, they have actually slowed down enrollment slightly in order to ensure diversity in the clinical trial population, particularly from the black community. Good morning, Dom. Rising numbers are certainly raising the already high stakes for a vaccine. Pfizer and biantech, in fact, are proposing expanding their phase three coronavirus vaccine trials to about 44,000 participants to help increase the diversity of the trial population. That's up from the current 30,000 volunteers. All of these clinical trials were going to be at least 30,000 people. And these are massive clinical trials done under an incredibly tight timeframe. And Pfizer, a certain way through, lowered the age in their clinical trial and expanded the number of people participating. There were also a few differences in the designs of how the vaccines were given and how they measured the response. For Pfizer, the doses are given three weeks apart. And then they started measuring efficacy one week after the second dose. For Moderna, they were given four weeks apart and efficacy is measured two weeks after the second dose. In some ways, that enabled Pfizer to start looking at whether the vaccine worked earlier than Moderna. In other ways, it was a risk because the farther apart the doses in, you know, vaccinology, typically the better the immune response. Also, the longer time you give to start counting, the more an immune response has time to build up. I think the decision to slow down for diversity was one of the more difficult ones we made, but we really felt like it was the right thing to do to build confidence in the vaccine. When we talked about it, we were teaming the broadest broadest growing down the study, which was one of the hardest decision I took last year. It was, look, if it worked so hard for so long and there's a lot of communities of corals who don't feel confident that the vaccine is efficacious for their community, is safe for their community, then there'll be a part of us where we will have felt we have felt. So we'd rather have more people taking the vaccine because they think confident than being first or a week. And so as we thought about those two things, we'd like to look the best outcome if you take a year or two year view. You don't get teaming the product used by, and as many people as you can, so let's do the right thing. We might not be first, but that's going to be fine. It wasn't difficult, though, because of Pfizer. It was important. It's important to know that never in those conversations was it about relative to Pfizer any the time, but it was actually was entirely about there's a pandemic and people are dying, and are we sure we want to slow down to focus on diversity in the study? And the answer was yes, now more than ever, because the people that are dying, that are higher risks, highest risk, need to have confidence in the study. And unfortunately, that was disproportionately from communities of color. You noted that to try to avoid any distraction as you're pursuing this mission for a COVID-19 vaccine, everybody has agreed not to enter into new 10B51 trading plans, add new shares to these plans or engage in additional unscheduled sales of Moderna stock in the open market. Tell us why you made that decision. And also, as these criticisms mount, do people really make a differentiation between these scheduled sales and ones that were already part of these plans? I understand, as recently as a few days ago, you and others on the executive team have these scheduled stock sales. So people keep seeing these mount up. Why not just stop them completely? Yes, so there's a lot of considerations to be taken in stopping the plan. As you know, this is highly regulated by the SEC. What we've decided to do with the team and the board in terms of not starting new plans because the Facebook is ongoing, even though we have access to no data, because again, the safety committee, which is independent for the company, has access to data. I don't even know if we have had cases so far, Meg, and how many we have. I have seen nothing since we started those subjects as it should be. As these companies were racing toward developing a vaccine, you also saw tremendous volatility in their stock prices. You know, results on a few patients could drive up, Moderna's share price, 10, 20, even more percent. And that meant that the executives who owned a lot of that stock got really, really wealthy at least on paper. And many of them also had stock sales set up. They were timed sales that were not tied to them knowing what was going to be happening, but just regular stock sales where they would sell some of their shares. And this garnered a lot of attention and a lot of criticism that these executives, even though it was through a perfectly legal mechanism, were profiting as they were working on these vaccines to solve a public health emergency. Much of the focus this week has been, of course, on the election. We have also been watching a huge spike in coronavirus cases, 120,000 new cases reported yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins. That's another daily record. So leading up to the phase three results, there were a lot of hints that these vaccines may work. Nobody knew. And nobody knew if they worked how well they were going to work. It was also a time when we were heading into the cold air season here in the US, cases had picked up again. It was starting to look really, really scary again, maybe scarier than we'd even seen before. We had discussed that something on the 70s would be a great, great, great success for us. FDA had set the bar at 50. And ourselves, internal luch had set it a little bit higher at 60 percent. The day of truth was a Sunday. And we woke up and we tried to focus on other things. I was expecting that it would be great if we could have 80 percent, but 70 percent would also be nice. We were, of course, afraid that we could get negative data. We have was called a data monitoring committee. So this is a group of independent external physicians highly experienced. And their job was to say, this works, you need to know, go ahead and file. This doesn't work, you need to know, stop the study. Or we don't know yet. Continue the study. And it was dreams and dreams and dreams of narratives and for each of the participants and all of this, of course, needed to be checked. It's, it's accurate. They deliberated. It didn't take very long and then they called some senior folks, including myself. They said, you know, you made it. We strongly recommend you to start preparing filing. But they didn't tell us how well it was met. Well, we were happy anyway because it said, okay, we're great. There we go. Then at the second call, it was only me and the legal, the general council of Pfizer. And then a group of two statisticians called to give us the numbers. It told me 95.6 percent. I still remember. And that was for me, unbelievable moment of joy. I knew that the vaccine worked. And then of course, you know, Albert disclosed to us that it was over 90 percent. And that was great. Albert courtman asked me to just sit and then he said, the vizaz agreed. They are really great. It was a lot of jumping up and down and and and and hugging and relief. And so it was a great feeling. And then we came to the decision that we need to tell the world. Not only that it is successful because until now, the plan was to say we have successful study. You will see there is also a new file. But also to give them a sign that this is a very effective vaccine. And to avoid getting a number, we set over 90 percent the efficacy. That's why you remember in the beginning, everybody was saying it's over 90. It was 95.6. That weekend, November 8th, I got the information on embargo. This often happens with reporters covering something. You agree to not put out the news until a certain time. And I learned Sunday night that the vaccine worked with 90 percent efficacy. I have never been more excited to get to go on television and tell the world something. Hi, Andrew. Well, 90 percent efficacy in this trial. This was a trial that enrolled almost 44,000 participants. And they saw 94 infections as of this first interim look. Now the way they get to 90 percent effectiveness is basically breaking down how many infections were on people on the vaccine and how many were in people on placebo. And they saw just such a dramatic imbalance. That's how you see that this protects with 90 percent efficacy against COVID-19. I was so worried somebody else was going to do it before me. I just knew that this was the news everyone had been waiting for. It changed my life. It changed your life. It changed everybody's life who was watching. It was the first sign that this pandemic was going to end. And we knew how it was going to end. Meg Tarel has a very special guest this morning. Meg, this is the news of the morning, the news of the week. And much more than that. Go ahead and take this away. We are all ears. Becky, thank you. That guest is Albert Borla, the CEO of Pfizer. Albert, thanks for being here. What a morning. I can only imagine what you all at Pfizer are feeling today. What was it like when you saw the results? 90 percent efficacy for your vaccine for COVID. It was exactly what you can imagine. It is a great day for science. It is a great day for humanity. When you realize that your vaccine has a 90 percent effectiveness. That's overwhelming. You understand that the hopes of billions of people and millions and the businesses and hundreds of governments that were felt on our soldiers. Now we can credibly threaten. I think we can see light at the end of the time. I feel blessed. I feel that very few people are in a position to be able to say that something that they did had a positive impact in so many people. That is true for me and for all the team, actually, even more for them. So I feel blessed. It's interesting. I was a bit bipolar about it. There's a side of me that was upset about falling awake behind. No, he likes to fall behind. But there was a side of me which was a week. He's not going to change how many millions lives we're going to be able to protect. To start after Moderna and finish before Moderna, no one would expect. Because they would expect Moderna to... And they were. Great company and they would move very, very fast. No one would expect it from a big company like Pfizer and we did it. And for me, that was the best confirmation. But yes, look who are. This is a very different fight. It just feels good that despite all of this and the difficulties, you end up with your nose above the finish line the first. I mean, that's, of course, that makes you feel good. We felt grateful to be in this position because as a scientist, you always want to do something good. This is a privilege to be in the position to be able to do that. It was a relief. So seeing that another mRNA technology had demonstrated efficacy meant that that last little piece of doubt of are those immune responses that we saw going to translate fell away. And so we knew at that point that our results were going to come in a week or so and then we knew that they were probably going to be comfortable. That almost felt as though it was our results. We were able to put things in motion that maybe we would have been a little bit more reluctant. This is planet A. We know that it works. We know that our results are going to come in in a week. And now the question is how quickly can we get to our filing first in the US and then around the world? Good morning, Andrew. That's right. So remember, of course, Pfizer reported that 90 percent efficacy number on its vaccine trial for COVID on Monday. It stopped when up quite a bit. We are now learning that Pfizer CEO Albert Borla sold $5.6 million worth of stock, $132,500 shares on November 9th. Now that was pursuant to one of these 10B51 plans, sort of a pre-planned sale. So I had asked to sell that before in January. That was before COVID almost. So there is a third party that is monitoring the conditions and once the price goes up, they will sell. So this is what happened and the shares were sold. Actually, I didn't even see it. That was sold. Frank, that was very sad, very devastated. I mean, I was in a situation that I was worried about how to make sure that we have a vaccine. And then all of that derailed the discussion and reflected bed on me on Pfizer. But that comes with a territory. I knew that I'm perfectly fine and then that disappeared after a couple of days of gossip. The Pfizer results were an incredible relief for everybody, but it was also just a fact that one company could not do this by itself. And so the pressure was on for Moderna to deliver as well. We knew at the end of the week before we saw Moderna's results that the results were coming. They had a hint that the data set was locked. They had enough cases to be able to start counting into deliver the efficacy figure. Our results are reviewed by an independent data safety monitoring board at DSMB. We went into the open part of that session, which is Moderna and a lot of our collaborators across the portfolio of products from Operation Warp Speed. And then they go into a closed session. They kick most of us out of the room. And there are a few people that are on the line that get to hear the efficacy results. I was one of the people that was dropped from the line that was kicked off the call. But we had an open room waiting to hear the results when our team returned. And I just got this text message from our clinical operations lead. He was saying, jump back on the line. We're hearing the results. So I came on and Steven Hogue, our president, had been invited to the closed session of the DSMB to hear the results. And he put it on speaker so that those of us that were in the room could hear it. And then this muffled voice came through and said, you guys did a great job. I got to work. And that muffled voice was Dr. Fauci. And he was so happy. We were so happy. He lasted 10 minutes. We just told you the top line of results and I said, we're going to send you the data. And so I left my office. I went and see my wife. And this time I cried a lot. All right. Listen up everybody. Some breaking news from Moderna. Meg Torell joins us right now with the headlines and a special guest. Meg, take it away. Hi, Becky. Well, we're getting Moderna's Phase 3 interim results 94.5 percent efficacy for their COVID-19 vaccine in this Phase 3 trial. They saw 95 cases of COVID-19 among these 30,000 participants. To talk about all of this, we're going to bring in Stefan Bunn's cell, the CEO of Moderna right now. Stefan, thanks for being with us this morning. Another historic day. 94.5 percent efficacy for your vaccine. Help us understand what this means. The second vaccine to show such high efficacy for getting us through this pandemic. I think it's great news. We're all excited last week when we are the good news about the Pfizer vaccine. And I think with the data that we're presenting this morning, it just hope that we should be able to get those vaccines soon into a marketplace to help vaccinate people at high risk to stop the pandemic. We opened a nice bottle of wine from going set out at night. When all the press release and everything was done in the slide and so on because we had to do in a conference code and so on. When all of our work was done, I would have had pre-prod and I was dinner and we opened a very nice bottle of wine. And we enjoyed it and I actually have the bottle. It was just such incredibly good news. Not just because it meant we had a second tremendously successful effective vaccine to deliver us out of this pandemic. But because in science, there's almost nothing more important than replicating an experiment to prove that the first result wasn't a fluke. Now you have two vaccines that use the same technology that delivered extremely similar and amazing efficacy one week after the other. If that's not a miracle, I don't know what is. Do you look at the rising shares of Moderna, Biontech, Novavax, Pfizer, McKesson, all creating billions in new shareholder wealth, including at least four new billionaires. Now topping the list is Biontech, which is of course, is partnering with Pfizer. Founder Orshahean gaining four billion in wealth just this year. He just became the 463rd richest person in the world with a total of 5.4 billionaires. I am as a founder of the company, of course, I have shares. And since the company has increased its value, I am now on the paper a billionaire. But I didn't sell any of my shares. It's not in our interest, so we didn't start the company to become rich. We really started the company to make a difference. And that's what we focus on. How is it different for all the teams that made vaccines or therapeutics? There's use teams that made Zoom or any other product that was used in the pandemic. It just happened to be there. I mean, the way I think about it, this was going to happen over time because the technology we know now was going to work for vaccines down the road. It was an accelerator and that's the piece that's just what it is. I think it's part of what makes this country special, which is people that are rewarded for taking risk. Half the stock I have is stock I got as CEO. But a lot of time people forget how the stock I have. It's because I bought it. And the only investor in the world we would stock in all the private trams from A to G. There's no way investor in the world was on that. My wife thought I was a bit crazy when I was taking all the time and savings from my previous job at Ilya and Bumerio and you were thinking about a stock when she would see me in terms of whether it's going to work or not work. It's going to work. It's not going to work for many years. That's been a long journey. But then there's a bigger question now about how much money these companies are making from these vaccines. Not every company did this in a for-profit way. Others went the nonprofit route, but they weren't the ones that won the race. Moderna and Pfizer and Biontech won the race and they did this on a for-profit basis. And they're going to reap billions of dollars in sales every year. These vaccines are going to be some of the biggest drugs of all time. They helped save the world or at least the world that has access to vaccines in a record time. Performed a miracle, but they're getting criticized for how much money they're making. It's an historic day. Today, this is the moment that the fight against COVID begins in earnest after months of research and clinical trials, the Pfizer Biontech vaccine delivery underway. And that's probably why you see the Dow futures indicated up by about 200 points this morning. That is the Moderna vaccine. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, does not need to be kept at negative 80 degrees celsius. You can see that is moving out and we'll go to distribution warehouse and hospitals today and all this week. We applied to the health department asking for permission to give to assess your Pfizer work. People that are going to manufacture inside and people that are going to the research centers. That without them being physically, they're going to operate and they give us this. And we started vaccinating them. And then we started extending it. So the first one was non-essential and that was not a sensor. 55 and above. That was the first group. So we opened it Monday Tuesday. I went and I did it together with members of my team. I felt really liberated. I got the vaccine with my wife at the same time and I held our hand. It's been 10 years of sweating bullets and a lot of ups and downs. It was kind of a super special moment. You know, so many people think about all the families that are going to come around the world. And that will have a chance to protect. And so that was a super special thing. It was a huge relief because my husband was very worried. Yes, some underlying conditions and he was very, very concerned. Actually, he got his before I got mine in New York's day. And I just came home after getting this first shot. And you could just see there was relief on his face to finally after all of this time. You know, he knew, okay, this is this kind of pressure and anxiety seemed to have lifted. I mean, he was another person. And then I got mine a few days later. I, being the nerd that I am, signed up to get my first dose on the anniversary of the sequence release. So on January 10th, I got my first dose. And it just happened that a few days before I was due to show up at the clinic to get vaccinated, they had opened up our employee vaccination to family. So I was able to bring my husband with me to get vaccinated. So we were able to share that experience with him. Somebody who had been taking care of me for the last year and making sure that I'm fed and hydrated. And the rest of the world around us is still running in my family notes that I'm alive. That was a really big moment. The CDC is updating its mask guidance given new information about how transmissible the Delta variant is. Now recommending that in areas of high transmission that people, even who are fully vaccinated, wear masks and public settings indoors. So the immediate future is potential booster shots against COVID. We know this virus is mutating. The companies are already working on updating the vaccines to cover new variants. And they've shown they can do this in tremendously short periods of time. Then they're looking at other viruses. Flu, that'll be something on the near term horizon, potentially other respiratory diseases as well. Maybe they'll all be packaged together in one mRNA vaccine that you get against a bunch of respiratory infections every year. And then beyond that, scientists are working on even harder to reach viruses like HIV. Because mRNA is something you can use to develop things so quickly and so powerfully, they think it might unlock new areas where science has been unsuccessful so far. We are having a surveillance system, but it's taking every single variant, but it's emergency. It's emergency. And we try to see if any of them escapes the protection of our vaccine in the beginning or over time. So right now we have very high-conferential level, but within 90 days, from the day that we will identify a variant of concern, we will be able to have massive production of one. So I feel optimistic. I really think it's the beginning of the decade of information-based masks. What we're most excited about here is that we didn't build the company to sell the pandemic. We actually built the company to change the way medicines are made. That we're using mRNA, the molecule, to send instructions to your body. The instructions can be anything you want. That can be how do you protect yourself against COVID? That can be how you protect yourself against flu? And it can also be, as you said, how do you immune system attack your cancer and a personalized cancer treatment? We're doing all those things in people, literally right now. And that's a much longer journey. That's the journey that we're on for the next 10 years as a company, and the place that we're excited to invest our innovation, our time, our blood, sweat, and tears together. I've covered a lot of public health emergencies. Ebola, Zika, Swine Flu, didn't turn out to be as bad as we thought it was going to be, but back in 2009, we were really worried. Science has never been able to move fast enough to catch a virus. And this time it did. And what a tremendous time for science to be so successful. We're just so lucky. I didn't expect that to happen. Most people can spend their entire lives trying to work in therapeutics and vaccines and never have a product yet. Even if you're clinical testing, let alone authorized. So to do that in a year was remarkable. Nothing is granted. We have to do everything right. And we did 20 years of research, benefited from many years of research of others who brought in also their technologies and then how. So this is an accomplishment of more or less human, human science mankind. There was a lot of pressure to make sure that I delivered clear information that people knew that they could trust. There was a lot of misinformation through this pandemic. Things got very political. And it wasn't that one side was always right. You had to cut through that. And in a sense also it was really strange covering this huge story from my house for 16 months. But it was also the kind of story where a reporter who covers the drug industry and who follows data, epidemiology, clinical trial results. In some ways the most effective reporting I could do was sitting at my desk with a highlighter. And that's what I did. I made sure I understood the data. I made sure I could talk to these experts from the CEOs of the companies to the vaccine scientists both inside and outside the companies. To make sure that we were really explaining both to the market, which was swinging wildly for the last year. But also to all of our viewers who are also regular people worried about their health and worried about their families, what was going on. And when we could expect to really get out of this. And that's why it was so amazing seeing these results. Because as a globe, we finally saw that this was going to end."
Real World effectiveness of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines - Microbial Minutes,Microbial Minutes,2021-04-16,sIe6wvVoJvg,"Do Pfizer and Moderna vaccines prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection? Can you transmit the virus after you've been vaccinated? And how effective are mRNA vaccines in real-world scenarios? Hi and welcome to Microbial Minutes. This is the American Society for Microbiology's Update on what's hot in the microbial sciences. I'm Ashley Hagen, Science Communication Specialist for ASM. And today we're looking at research evaluating the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines outside of clinical trials. In December of 2020, Pfizer and Moderna became the first COVID-19 vaccines to receive emergency use authorization in the United States, and the first successful mRNA vaccines to ever make it to market. Today, there are amongst a handful of additional COVID-19 vaccines being actively distributed in multiple countries around the world. Randomized placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that mRNA vaccines are greater than 90 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, and especially effective at preventing severe disease. But whether vaccination prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in real-world conditions has yet to be determined. In other words, we've known for a while that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing people from getting sick and requiring hospitalization or dying from COVID-19. But we have not known whether vaccination prevents the virus from infecting people all together, or if it's possible for people to still acquire ASM-TOMATIC SARS-CoV-2 infection and unknowingly spread the virus after being vaccinated. On March 29, 2021, the CDC's morbidity and mortality weekly report published data on the subject. From December 14, 2020 to March 13, 2021, weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted on a cohort of 3,950 frontline workers, regardless of symptom status. Only individuals with no documented history of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to enrollment were qualified to participate in the study. The final cohort consisted of health care personnel, including physicians, PAs, nurse practitioners, dentists, nurses, therapists, technicians, medical assistants, orderlies, and all other persons providing clinical support in inpatient or outpatient settings. First responders, including firefighters, law enforcement, correction, and EMTs, and other essential frontline workers, such as those in hospitality, delivery and retail, teachers, and all other occupations that require contact within three feet of the public. 75 percent of participants received one or more doses of vaccine during the study. 2,479 or 62.8 percent received both doses of mRNA vaccine, while 477 or 12.1 percent had received only one dose of mRNA vaccine by the end of the study. Vaccination status was confirmed through self-report, electronic medical records, and direct upload of vaccine card images at eight U.S. locations, which vaccine was administered varied based on time and availability of each product. 62.7 percent of vaccinated individuals received the Pfizer vaccine, and 29.6 received Moderna. The remaining 7.7 percent were still pending product verification at the time of publication of this study. There were two major components to the design of this study. Active surveillance for COVID-19-related symptoms, and weekly PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. For 13 consecutive weeks, participants were asked to keep track of and report any fever chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, diarrhea, muscle aches, or loss of smell or taste that they experienced. They were also asked to self-collect weekly, mid-turbanate nasal swabs and ship them on cold packs to the Marshfield Clinic Laboratory in Marshfield, Wisconsin. Were all samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via RT-PCR, regardless of whether or not the patient was exhibiting symptoms. In the event that COVID-19-related symptoms did develop, an additional nasal swab and saliva specimen were collected at the time of symptom onset, and tested in the same Marshfield Clinic Laboratory as well. Over the course of this study, 205 participants in total were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR. 87.3 percent of these correlated with cases that displayed symptoms of COVID-19-associated illness. 2 percent correlated with cases that displayed symptoms inconsistent with the study's definition of COVID-19-associated illness. And 10.7 percent reported no symptoms at all. Two hospitalizations and zero deaths occurred during this study. Individuals were considered partially immunized 14 days or more after the first dose of vaccine and fully immunized 14 days or more after the second dose. She was considered indeterminate during the 13 person days in between partial or full immunization. 161 infections of SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed by RT-PCR during the 116,657 person days of this study when participants were unvaccinated. 33 infections were confirmed during the indeterminate period, and were excluded from analysis. 8 infections were confirmed during the 41,856 person days when individuals were partially immunized, and 3 infections occurred during the 78,902 person days when participants were fully vaccinated. The incidence rate for partially vaccinated individuals was 0.19 per 1,000 person days, and 0.04 per 1,000 person days for fully vaccinated individuals. And adjusted vaccine effectiveness was therefore 80 percent in partially vaccinated individuals, and 90 percent in fully vaccinated individuals. Here are a few key takeaways from today's session. We know that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated greater than 90 percent efficacy at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in phase 3 clinical trials. Data now also indicate that mRNA vaccines are 80 percent effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 days or more after the first dose, and 90 percent effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection 14 days or more after the second dose of vaccine outside of clinical trials. This data represents some of the first large-scale evidence that mRNA vaccines are effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in real situations where the risk of exposure may be higher than normal. And reduced infection suggests that vaccination also limits viral transmission, and is important to controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. But that's the latest on what's hot in the microbial sciences. As always, it's important to remember that this data is preliminary. New information about COVID-19 vaccines is being produced regularly, so keep seeking current and reputable data. And don't forget to subscribe to ASM's YouTube channel and ring the bell for notifications every time we have a microbial minutes update. I'm Ashley Hagen.

Operation Warp Speed Chief Advisor discusses Moderna vaccine: It's an extraordinary vaccine,CNBC Television,2020-11-16,nhWAaS-QNKE,"The next one is Dr. Montsef Slowy, who helps lead operation walkspeed along with our senior health and science reporter, Meg Torell. Meg over to you. Well, thanks so much, Dr. Slowy. Thanks for being here. This is just a huge day. Thank you for having me. Before you became Chief Advisor to Operation Warp Speed, you spent more than three decades developing vaccines in the pharmaceutical industry. So maybe just help put into context in the perspective what two different vaccines with 90 percent plus efficacy really means in this pandemic? Well, it is an extraordinary outcome, frankly, to have two different vaccines tested in different conditions by two different companies developed independently, yield very similar outcomes. This gives a huge confidence into the data obtained and really suggests that the 90 percent and more efficacy is true and real. The fact that they have been developed in over a period of less than a year is just incredible. You know, I spent 30 years in the same company of which 27 was spent developing one singular vaccine against malaria, for instance. And I think the fastest we ever did was four or five years. So major achievement, part of which, of course, relate to the company's performance, technology, decades of work beforehand, part of which relates to, frankly, the support that Operation War Speed has provided. And the operation has been really a visionary approach that the HHS Secretary had to put together science, academic, et cetera, the Department of Defense and industry expertise and experience together in one place and shield them from bureaucracy and help them help the companies. So up to now it's been an amazing day. Every Monday like this, I'll take any time. I know. We'll take a couple more of these, please. You know, a couple of questions that I'm hearing from experts today about these vaccines. And we know you don't have the answers yet, but I wonder, you know more about this than almost anybody. So how likely is it that these vaccines will provide sterilizing immunity, actually prevent infection, not just disease, and how long do you expect the protection will last? Well, I think the likelihood that they prevent infections or provide sterilizing immunity is significant given the level of efficacy achieved. But remember, these are short-term outcomes, right? These are four, five, six months trials. And therefore, the level of antibodies will wane with time. And I do not think that protection against disease will wane with time. I can explain why. But protection against infection, the sterilizing immunity may decrease with the waning antibodies. However, we encounter the virus, we boost our immune response back at a much, much faster pace than the first time. And that's why I believe protection against disease is there to persist at pretty high or very high levels. Protection against infection will test it. I expect it to be positive, not as high as 95 percent, but maybe not highly persistent. Okay, well, that would be good. It's Sarah, Dr. Slowy. Thanks for being with us. We just heard in the last half hour or so from President-elect Biden, he was talking about the hopeful news on the vaccine front. But here's what he said. He said, quote, they have this warp speed program to distribute this. If we have to wait, it puts us behind a month or a month and a half. Why? It seems to me that as the rollout of this vaccine is happening, that's exactly when the transition of power is said to be happening in this country. Why has there not been engagement with Biden and his advisors? And what is that going to look like when every day counts here and more than a thousand Americans are dying every day? Well, since day one, our objective has been to go fast and absolutely every day and everywhere, our counted. And that's why we are where we are. Our focus is to save American lives and people's life in general. And that's why we will continue focusing on. We're not going to be distracted by circumstances or context. We're going to continue running as fast as we can, as well as we can, always looking after safety and efficacy of the vaccines. And clearly, we would hope that there is no disruption because of the transition. But this is not for us to call on. Frankly, as I said, we want to focus on the job to be done, which is the liver vaccines fast. Right. Well, I would think that this would help in that effort. But I guess it's up to President Trump. In the meantime, Dr. Slowy, the antibody cocktails were meant to be the antibody drugs from Regeneron and Lily were meant to be the bridge to the vaccine. And they're here, which is great news. And they have good trial data. And yet the production of them is so limited that that I mean, the numbers are just so small in comparison from what for what we need right now. Why weren't they prioritized more? I know you did give money from Operation War Speed for manufacturing and for scaling, but it's just not happening at the levels that we need it right now. Yeah, listen, I apologize to say this, but Monday morning, quarter backing is always much easier. It's impossible to predict the amount that we needed. And remember, all of this has started eight months ago. And the speed with which things are going is and heard off. We have done everything possible. I lightly regenerate on and the operation to scale up into the manufacturing capacity that we could access and that existed."
The Delta Variant and Vaccine Protection,Healthcare Triage,2021-08-21,t4VnlXIiSeY,"With much of the United States and the process of reopening from COVID-19, it feels as if there's a gradual return to normal life. Still, looming over the excitement is concerned about emerging variants and whether the vaccines will hold against them. And that's the topic of this week's healthcare triage. Before we get started talking about vaccine efficacy against the COVID-19 variants, let's lay some groundwork. The primary way these viruses mutate is by changing regions of the spike protein used by the virus to bind to and enter human cells. These changes either cause tighter binding of the receptor, which increases transmissibility, or they change one of the sites where antibodies bind. Additionally, some variants suppress human inflammatory reactions, allowing them to create more copies before the body is able to mount a response. The CDC has identified a number of variants of concern, labeled by Greek letters. We have the alpha variant, which emerged from the UK and currently accounts for 2.4 percent of US cases. This strain is notable for increased transmissibility and potentially more severe disease. Next is the beta variant, which also has been detected in the United States and is also notable for increased transmissibility, as well as potentially reduced susceptibility to antibodies in vitro, but it does not account for many US cases. At least at the time this script was written. Then we have the gamma variant, which was prominent in Brazil, appears to be less susceptible to antibodies in vitro, and currently accounts for 1.3 percent of US cases. And finally, the Delta variant, which has garnered major attention in the media. At present, this variant accounts for over 80 percent of US cases and is also notable for increased transmissibility and potentially reduced susceptibility to antibodies in vitro. The body of high quality evidence for efficacy of specific vaccines against specific variants is sparse. Part of the issue is that the outcome we're most interested in, severe COVID cases is rare. Trying to get statistically significant evidence by randomized controlled trial for specific variants requires humongous sample sizes, which even if possible, will be hard to justify given the undoubtable benefit of vaccines. The data we do have suggests that the Pfizer vaccine has good efficacy against all the major variants, although some evidence suggests that neutralizing antibody activity may be lower for the beta and Delta variants. But that's in vitro data. Let's look at how this plays out in vivo. A prospective cohort study of over 23,000 UK healthcare workers found that the Pfizer vaccine was about 85 percent effective at preventing all COVID during a period when the prevalence of the alpha variant in the UK was greater than 50 percent. The case control study conducted during Qatar's third wave of COVID reported 90 percent efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the alpha strain and 75 percent efficacy against the beta strain. Notably, however, there were no severe COVID cases with either of these variants in the vaccinated group. Finally, another case control study from the UK similarly found that the Pfizer vaccine had 93 percent efficacy against the alpha strain and 88 percent efficacy against the Delta strain. There are limited data on Moderna's efficacy for variants, but it's presumed to be similar to Pfizer's given their shared mechanism. So what's behind this difference between the in vitro antibody data and the in vivo observational data? The antibody data is derived by taking vaccinated animals or humans and assessing the ability of their serum to neutralize COVID. Long time viewers of the show know how we feel about surrogate outcomes. The level of neutralizing antibodies is far from a perfect correlate and the level of antibody necessary to prevent severe COVID is fairly low. To make the issue more complicated as we've covered in previous episodes, much of the immunity that develops against COVID comes from the T cell response, which isn't measured in many studies and has been shown to have much less variation. Moving on to the other vaccines, a recent preprint suggested that an individual who had received the J&J vaccine neutralizing antibody activity against variants including Delta was low. One of the authors of that study did declare some conflicts of interest, having received research grants from and serving on advisory boards for places like Pfizer. Contrary to that study, Johnson and Johnson released preliminary data from an in vitro study that suggested a strong antibody response to the Delta variant, but keep in mind that this is from a subset of only eight participants. Looking to the in vivo data, the original Johnson and Johnson study showed up to 85 percent efficacy overall on preventing severe COVID. That study was performed in South Africa and Brazil, while variants of concern like beta were prominent and found no difference in efficacy for these. Looking at the Delta variant, preliminary data released in early August from a clinical trial in South Africa suggests that the J&J vaccine showed up to 71 percent efficacy against hospitalization from the Delta variant, so that's good news too. Finally, the AstraZeneca vaccine. In a post-talk analysis of the original AstraZeneca randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of this vaccine against the alpha variant compared to placebo was 70 percent, not statistically different from the overall efficacy. A separate randomized controlled trial showed no significant benefit against mild to moderate infections with the beta variant, but this study had many limitations, including a small sample size, a young population at low risk for symptomatic COVID, and lack of severe infections. Another case control study found 74.5 percent efficacy for the alpha variant, and 67 percent efficacy for the Delta variant after two, but not one, keep in mind, most of these studies are observational. While they control for some factors, they can't account for individual patient behaviors. It's not unreasonable to think that individuals who have avoided COVID vaccines may have underlying medical or social reasons not to. Additionally, groups that were more likely to be exposed to COVID were more likely to be vaccinated early in rollouts, which may skew the data. But even then, there's no evidence to suggest that any of the vaccine struggle to prevent severe COVID infections from variants. Still, there are contingency plans of this changes, including Moderna's new booster vaccine, which reportedly has increased neutralizing activity against certain variants. On a final note, there have been a few headlines about the Delta Plus variant, but it's still under investigation, and as of the shooting of this video, isn't accounting for a large number of Delta cases. We'll continue to monitor the situation, and keep you all posted with any updates. In the meantime, please continue to get vaccinated. As Ed Young recently detailed in the Atlantic, unvaccinated people are highly susceptible to the variants, and along with that remains true, the less likely our current vaccines will be able to hold in line.

Moderna vaccine shows 90% efficacy,CNBC Television,2021-04-13,jmWHn46apKw,"Hey, well, from Moderna, head of a big vaccine R in D day tomorrow morning, putting out a lot of data about its vaccine, including six month follow-up to its phase three trial. Now, this is similar to what we saw from Pfizer very recently. They're saying that after six months after the median folks have gotten the second dose of the trial, 900 plus cases have been seen of COVID. The vaccine efficacy is more than 90 percent, six months out against severe disease. They say it's 95 percent. Also providing some updates on kind of the next steps for the vaccine, both in trials in kids and teens, as well as what they're doing in terms of the variants. So in terms of kids, they fully enrolled a trial in kids ages 12 to 17. So we should get data at some point for them. And kids down to age six months, they're currently enrolling that trial. So those data will come later. They also have some early data from mice looking at these updated vaccines targeting variants. And in particular, the B1351 variant associated with South Africa, they have both developed a new vaccine, targeting that variant, and also have a vaccine, which includes both the older original strain and the updated B1351 targeted strain. And they say the animal studies, at least, for those are promising as of now. Finally, from Moderna, an update on supply, they say they've delivered 117 million doses to the U.S. government to date. They're on track for 200 million by the end of May, and 300 million total by the end of July. And guys, of course, we just heard on Twitter from Pfizer's CEO, Albert Borla, that they're ahead of schedule in delivering their vaccine to the U.S., Borla saying that they've increased production, and they will deliver 10 percent more of the vaccine by the end of May. So that's 220 million total doses by then, and they're speeding up delivery of the full 300 million. Now, two weeks early, we should see that mid-July. So guys, this coming, as we are hearing about the J&J vaccine pause, that there will be enough from these two companies to cover adults in the U.S. by the end of May, certainly by the end of July. Guys, we should also mention we have Moderna's CEO, Stefan Bunsel, joining us tomorrow morning, ahead of that vaccine's day on Squawk Box at 7 a.m. Guys. Shepherd Smith here. Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."
Moderna CEO answers questions on COVID vaccine efficacy,Fox Business,2021-04-17,Cih7vs9SxN4,"Welcome back. Well, the distribution of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine on pause this weekend as a CDC panel investigates potential links to a rare blood clot disorder. Join me right now in a Fox Business exclusive, another maker of COVID-19 vaccine. The CEO of Moderna is here. Stefan Bonsel. Stefan, great to see you this weekend. Thank you very much for joining us. I want to start off with your reaction to these latest developments about the blood clotting. What do you know about this? People are worried now about vaccines in general. So good morning, Maria. And thank you for having me. So we're of course monitoring safety very carefully and we have since the vaccine has been authorized in December. We are talking of course to VFD and the CDC on a very regular basis. The good news so far is that the vaccine seems like we saw in the face freeze study to be very well tolerated. We have now known more than 63 million people were for sorry, 46 million people were for data. So it's hard to be a big number. I think the good news, if there is a civil lining in what's happening today is the American people feel great about the CDC and the FDA and have a tech safety of American citizens very seriously. And that any signals needs to be investigated to make sure that the vaccine can be used safely. I'm of course not close to the situation because it is not our product. But I believe and trust the FDA and the CDC's and the scientists and the advisors to do the right thing for the American people. Yeah, no, you make a great point and you have to be congratulated. I want to thank you on the have of all of our viewers who have gotten vaccinated and who are planning on it. You did this in warp speed. You got a vaccine out on the market and really lifted the public up. So thank you to you and to all of your scientists, Stefan, for this incredible performance. People now are worried about side effects, worried about the need for another booster shot. What are your thoughts on this? How much efficacy should we expect after getting vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine? There's a great question, Maria. So on the efficacy, we announced this week that after six months after the boost following the participant in the phase three study and you know it was 30,000 people. We are still seeing an efficacy north of 90 percent. And so six months that the vaccine seems to be doing very well in the real world, where as you know, we have variants circulating in the community. So we're going to feel very confident about the vaccine and continue to advise people given the risk of long disease, with long COVID or hospitalization. And also to get this pandemic under control, so we can go back to all our normal lives and be with a lot of the ones and be outside and traveling that people should be vaccinated. And the variant is going to be the big question in terms of boosting. And I think there are two things to think about. One is natural waning immunity, which is either you get infected naturally and you make antibodies or you get vaccinated and you make antibodies. Over time, the level of antibody is going to go down, that is normal and natural. And so you have this effect, which is over time, boosts are going to be required. It is too early to know half frequently because we don't have enough data. The overcomponent Maria is the variance. Yeah, these variants are, you know, worrisome because we don't know how severe they are, right? Correct. And we don't know how they're going to impact in the long term, the vaccine efficacy. In a short term, we are not worried. The B117, the one first identified in the UK, which is very prevalent in the US now, we have seen and shown and published that the level of antibody is similar to the old strain of a virus. So we feel very good about this one. In the one P1, the one first identified in Brazil and 351, the one first identified in South Africa, you see a little bit of a drop of the antibody but still way higher than the antibody that people get infected. So we believe that people will be protected again, those two variants in a short term. What is impossible to know, Maria, is what happened in the fall on X-Winter. If we have those variants or new variants that don't exist yet or have not been sequenced yet, which is why we believe that boosting is going to be really important to keep the country safe and open. And we are working very hard at it. In 30 days, in modern 2 months ago, developed a variant boost for the South Africa strain. It's in the clinic now. We published this week data in animal showing it works very well. And we should have human data very soon. I see. I see. Okay. Stefan, let me ask you with regard to these blood clotting that we're hearing about from Johnson & Johnson. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that J&J privately reached out to other COVID-19 makers to say, look, Pfizer and Moderna, let's join efforts to look into the reports of blood clotting. Let's do a little bit more of a deep dive on the blood clotting risks. J&J, through emails and phone calls with the Wall Street Journal, said that they tried to build an informal alliance among all of those companies. Do your thoughts on that? Did you decline? Did Pfizer decline? What happened? So, what I can tell you, Maria, is we communicate to the regulators, the FDA, and to the CDC, and of course, to the U.S. government, on the daily basis. We share all the data as we have to. There is a very high level of cooperation. We believe that it's the regulators who has to coordinate and gather and collect all the data and compare the data. I don't think it is something that industry should be doing. I think it's a job of regulators, and I think regulators are doing a very fine job, as I said earlier. Okay, I want to talk to you about the vaccine day that you had this week. A number of analysts are talking about the growth potential for Moderna. First, tell us what you revealed in terms of the COVID-19 situation. And then I'd like to talk about the impact of this vaccine day to highlight the other things you're working on in the pipeline at Moderna. Yes, Maria. So, on COVID-19, we revealed the piece we just talked about, which is six more efficacy is very high. Level of antibody at six more is very high. And that the variant candidate, which is being tested in the clinic right now as a boost, is performing very well in animal testing. And that we should have very soon in the spring, the clinical data, the FDA, I said, very clear guidelines of what they expect to see in terms of size of a study and endpoint of a study, which is very helpful to industry. And so we are hopeful that potentially no late in the summer or early fall, which could have a boost specific to the South Africa strain, offer rise on the US market. That would be a wonderful thing. So that next fall and next winter are safe. In terms of rates of a pipeline, as you know, Maria, Moderna is a platform company. And in traditional pharmaceuticals, you don't have platforms. Every drug is a different drug with own risk profile. mRNA is like software. It's four letters that code every mRNA under the sun to make protein in your body. And so we have a very large pipeline of nine vaccines. And most of those vaccine, Maria, they are first in class vaccine. What does it mean? It means they are vaccine against virus that hurts you, man, for which there's no vaccine on the market. As you know, they are full vaccines, but as it's well reported, you know, in a good year, you get 60 percent efficacy, which is not great. And in the bad day, you get 20 or 30 percent efficacy. We believe we can bring thanks to mRNA, a 90 plus percent efficacy flu vaccine. And our vision, Maria, is to combine the COVID boosts with a flu vaccine into one single dose so that every year you can go to your CVS store or your GP, get one dose that will have a right variant of COVID for that winter, the right flu strength for that winter, so that you are safe and can have a nice fall and winter. That's another piece we talked about. That's a big deal. It's a huge deal. I think it's not today disturbed the current flu market. And I think a lot of people that today do not want to take a flu shot because they worry about lack of efficacy. We'll in the future want a flu shot so that they can not be sick of flu or be hospitalized. As you know, before COVID, we still have, you know, 30, 60,000 people being hospitalized every year in this country because of flu and many, many days of work lost or time with families and friends and vacation lost because of flu. So I think we can really have a big dent on this virus that we've all platform. A word on cancer as well and HIV vaccine Stefan. This was also part of the growth story at the vaccine day this week. Correct. So we are partnering with Dr. Fauci team at the NIH and many scientists are on the country on a HIV vaccine that sounds very promising. As you know, 40 years after the discovery of HIV and AIDS, we still don't have a vaccine to protect people and the world needs a vaccine against HIV. We have five drug in the clinical trial against cancer from, you know, skin cancer, breast cancer, variant cancer and many more. We have also a drug partnered with AstraZeneca in cardiology that is injected in people's heart as a one intervention barrier. It takes around 10 minutes after a heart attack so that the mRNA will instruct your heart muscle to grow new blood vessel, to re-bring oxygen and nutrients to your heart muscle. So that if you survive your heart attack, you can have a good quality of life without having heart failure. It's been an incredible year and we thank you Stefan Bonsel. Thanks very much for joining me and congrats on this incredible performance at Moderna. We will see you soon. Thank you Stefan."
Moderna CEO on its latest vaccine efficacy data,CNBC Television,2021-08-05,X_35drqSqrA,"Welcome. You've got a lot of news and you're released this morning in addition to your earnings, particularly about your COVID vaccine. Let's start with the six-month results that you have showing 93 percent efficacy is durable all the way out to six months. You know, we just saw data from Pfizer showing that their efficacy at six months drops to 84 percent. Are you saying this is sort of directly comparable and Moderna at six months stays at 93 percent. Let's good morning, Meg. Indeed, we're very pleased to share the final analysis of a phase three at 93 percent which shows very good duration of efficacy. If you think about it, the studies were done at similar time. They were done in a similar design with a same variant circulating in the US. So we're very happy about that duration because that's what's very important to protect people. Well, of course, there's been so much talk about the need for booster shots and we are already seeing multiple countries making plans to give them. What's your expectation for what we'll see here in the US when people might start to need and to get boosters? So I think there's a few things to think about. One is, of course, duration of protection when people have been vaccinated first and we wish vaccine and how is that vaccine holding on in thermoefficacy? And then, of course, there's a variant because, you know, Delta is a very different virus. When the virus, we had initially designed in all of our vaccines. And so it's important to think about boosting. We're also sharing this morning and we're going to review the data on the call at 8 a.m. and we're going to publish in the coming days. We have shown, we've been on a vaccine that if you give a third dose of the same vaccine that is currently used in the US, you actually see a very important increase in geometric mean tighter, the quantity of antibodies. For beta virus, the one first identified in South Africa, you get 32x increase between second dose and third dose for the gamma, the P1 in Brazil. You get 43x and for that, I would actually care a lot about. You get 42x and so we think the boosters are going to be very helpful to keep people safe for the long term, better because it's for the public officials to decide what to do and when to do it."
Covid-19 Vaccine Efficacy Explained | It's Not What You Think,Data Demystified,2020-11-17,ZRYZGWDp5Ag,"Unless you've been living in Iraq these past two weeks, you've probably heard the great news that two of the leading vaccine contenders for COVID-19 have had some amazing initial results. The joint effort by BioNTech and Pfizer announced on November 9th that their vaccine candidate has a greater than 90 percent efficacy. And just this week, on November 16th, Moderna announced that their vaccine candidate has a 94.5 percent efficacy. I'm not an expert on vaccines, but based on everything I've been reading, this seems like an absolutely major success that we should all be celebrating. And it's because I'm not an expert on vaccines that I'm not going to discuss the differences between these two vaccines or how they'll be distributed or even how likely they are to have side effects. There are a bunch of amazing YouTubers putting out great content just on this. Instead, since my expertise is on data, I'm going to help you understand what those efficacy numbers actually mean. And I'll fully admit that when I first read the news stories about these vaccine candidates, I did not interpret those values correctly at all. And I'm guessing neither did you. Welcome to DataDemystified. I'm Jeff Gallic, and if you stick around, I'm going to debunk what I think is the most common incorrect interpretation of those efficacy numbers. And then, I'll explain to you what they actually mean. When I first saw 90 and 94.5 percent efficacy, I immediately thought that the interpretation of those values was that if I'm vaccinated, the likelihood of me getting infected with COVID-19 after being exposed to it dropped by 90 or 94.5 percent depending on which vaccine I got. And in the words once vaccinated, if someone's sprayed COVID-19 in my face, I'd be only about 10 or 5 percent likely to actually get infected. That seems sensible when we talk about efficacy. In other contexts, that's exactly what efficacy means. If I have an antibacterial soap that claims to kill 99 percent of germs, we correctly interpret that to mean that of all the bacteria on our hands, the soap will kill 99 percent of them. It's 99 percent effective at killing bacteria. If I have a manufacturing process that detects 95 percent of all defects before product is completed, that means that it is stopping 95 percent of all the problems from going through to the consumer. It's 95 percent effective at stopping defects. If I have an algorithm that recommends songs for you to listen to based on your preferences, and that algorithm is 90 percent effective, that means that 90 percent of the time, it recommends songs you'll actually like. It's 90 percent effective at predicting your musical tastes. And yet that is not at all what is meant by efficacy with vaccines or drugs of any kind. In the medical testing world, efficacy has a totally different meaning. When drug companies test vaccines, they conduct double-blind, randomized controlled trials. Basically, they randomly assign some people to get a vaccine, and some people to get a harmless saline injection, otherwise called a placebo. Neither the doctor or nurse administering the shot, nor the study participant know which one they're getting, and only when the study is completed to the results become known. This is absolutely the best way to test vaccines, and the hope is that the people who get the vaccine injection experience far less disease than those who got the placebo. If that's the case, we can conclude that the vaccine is effective. Note that when I say effective here, I'm referring to the relative effectiveness of the placebo to the vaccine. And that's actually what is meant by effectiveness in these vaccine trials. To unpack this, let's take a closer look at the data that was in both of the press releases from these two companies. Though, before we do that, it's worth pointing out that these are not peer-reviewed results, and we don't actually have all the data to analyze. But we have as just what the companies put out. Now I'm not suggesting that there's anything sketchy going on here, but it is the case that we can't thoroughly vet everything just yet. That's what the FDA will do when they consider whether to approve these vaccines for emergency use. Anyway, BioNTech and Pfizer had 38,955 people receive two doses of the vaccine, where they release their preliminary results. Of those roughly 39,000 people, 94 were infected with COVID-19. Critically, though, of those 94 people, 85 were in the placebo condition, and 9 were in the vaccine condition. In other words, you were far less likely to get infected if you got the actual vaccine than if you got the harmless saline injection. So where does 90 percent efficacy come from? It comes from comparing the number of people infected across the two groups. Of the 94 total infections, 85 were in the placebo condition, and so we take 85 and divide it by 94 and get 90.4 percent. That's the efficacy number they're reporting. From a DERNA, it's the same story. Some were around 30,000 people received two doses of their vaccine, or two doses of the placebo, and of those, 95 were ultimately infected with COVID-19. 90 were in the placebo condition, and 5 were in the vaccine condition. 90 divided by 95 gets you 94.7 percent, which is the efficacy number reported. To be clear, this is absolutely the standard way to report efficacy in vaccine trials, and yet I find this very confusing because it just doesn't align with how I think about efficacy. While here 90 percent efficacy, I think that I'm only 10 percent likely to get infected once I get the vaccine, but that's actually not quite right. That 90 percent doesn't say anything about how likely you are to get infected after exposure. Instead, one way to look at it is to think about how many people of those who received the vaccine actually got infected. If we do that, we see that for the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine, 9 out of about 19,477 people were just 0.04 percent were infected with COVID. We can compare that to the control group where 85 out of 19,478 people were infected or 0.43 percent. In other words, we can think that our likelihood of infection actually goes down by a full order of magnitude, from about 0.4 percent to 0.04 percent. And you get basically the same result for the Moderna vaccine. But even that conclusion isn't enough to match the intuition for effectiveness that I think we all want, and that's because we don't know what populations the people studied came from. As in, we need to know the baseline level of disease in each of the areas where these companies tested their vaccines. If the infection rate in those areas were very high, then the vaccine seems to be highly effective, at least in the more intuitive sense of effectiveness. If the disease spread was relatively low, then it's a lot harder to say. The point is that yes, we should absolutely celebrate these amazing medical breakthroughs. And once safety is fully assessed and verified, we should likely all line up to get vaccinated so we can end the horror of this global pandemic. And yet, when we do that, we should be fully informed about what the data back in these vaccines tell us. When we hear amazing results like 90 and 94.5 percent effectiveness, we need to understand what is being described is the ratio between the vaccinated and placebo group infection rates. And not how effective vaccine is at actually preventing you from getting infected with COVID-19. Again, this isn't an indictment of vaccines. Far from it. The call to action for you as the consumer of this information to make sure you fully understand what you're seeing. If the FDA vets these vaccines and confirms that they are as effective and safe as they claim, they will reduce the likelihood of anyone getting the vaccine from getting infected with COVID-19. But how much will that likelihood decrease isn't 90 or 94.5 percent? We actually don't know exactly how much it will reduce infection likelihoods, but assuming they are safe, any significant reduction is likely to help billions of people around the world. In closing, I wish all of you to be safe, healthy, and diligent in fighting this disease, while we wait for these vaccines to be fully vetted and distributed.

BREAKING: Review of Moderna Coronavirus Vaccine Safety / Efficacy Data,"F. Perry Wilson, MD",2020-12-15,j9CmcnpRvOs,"Hi everybody, I'm F.Pray Wilson of the Yale School of Medicine and I'm coming at you on December 15th with new documents relating to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine application to the FDA. This is the stuff that's going to be released as part of the vaccine-related biological products advisory committee on December 17th. So this is the deepest look we have yet into the data behind the large scale phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrated efficacy of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. There's a ton of stuff here, some old stuff, some new stuff. So I'm going to just walk through the tables and figures with you really quick to give you a sense. The link to this document is in the video description below. All right, so I'm going to start down here at table 4 because everything else is just sort of definitional. So this is just telling us here the sort of breakdown of the patients in the trial. You can see that there's 15,208 randomized to vaccine, 15,210 randomized to placebo. So a total of 30,418 patients. Now they have different denominators based on various definitions. So there's a full analysis set. So every single person who's in the trial that they have data on at least, it looks like they lost a couple here and there. And then a per protocol set, which is going to be based on people who at least completed one dose of the vaccine and so on and so forth. Largely this doesn't change the results or the numbers too much. So we're not going to obsess too much about the different denominator definitions. The safety analysis population as is appropriate includes basically every patient. Okay, so let's talk about the demographic characteristics of this population. This is in the people who got at least one dose. But you know, so this is our question here is whether this is a population that we can generalize. So we've got about 50 percent men, 50 percent women, the mean age is 52 years, the maximum age is 95 men, 18, remember Pfizer had 16 year olds in the trial and actually started enrolling as young as 14 in the end. So these are all adults, 18 to 95 years. Old, 25 percent, 65 and older, pretty good. We want to see those older patients, right, to make sure that the vaccine is efficacious in this high risk population. Here's your racial breakdown. Here we see 10 percent black and other racial minorities here. Ethnicity you've got 20 percent Hispanic, which is not bad for a trial of this type. Really interesting in the Moderna trial, I didn't know this, 25 percent are healthcare workers. That's so cool, right? A good population that you want to target because they're obviously high risk of contracting COVID-19 in the healthcare setting and also as a healthcare worker myself, always nice to see myself represented in the trial. They also had predefined high risk conditions, we'll go through that in a minute. So you can see about a quarter of the patients had a high risk condition and then they combine risk in age here, I wouldn't worry about that too much. I'm going to skip that, that's just looking at the different denominator, the safety set. Look at table 8 here. So you can see you've got about 75, you've got three quarters of the population with no severe risk factors for COVID-19, but the rest do. You've got 5 percent of people with chronic lung disease, 5 percent with significant cardiac disease, 6 percent with severe obesity and around 10 percent with diabetes. So these are people that you might expect to have worse outcomes. Were they to become infected with COVID-19? These were predefined by Moderna, so it looks pretty good. Those seem to be the high risk conditions in addition to age, of course. So table 9 is the interminousness. This has been published before, so this is where we get the 94.5 percent vaccine efficacy, but just to walk you through the numbers, we've got five cases in the vaccine group, we've got 90 cases in the placebo group. Remember, these are randomized, it's random, who goes and which group. So if the vaccine's not going to work, you'd expect a 50-50 split between these groups, not so. Only five in the vaccine group, 90 in the placebo group that translates to 94.5 percent efficacy. And all the time I want you to look at the confidence intervals here, this range of uncertainty. Because you're always estimating the true effect. And this suggests that the true effect is probably somewhere between 86 and 98 percent regardless, that is great for a vaccine that is really effective. And then you've got them breaking it up into the younger people, 18 to 65, still very effective, basically no different in efficacy. And in 65 and older, check this out, zero cases in the vaccine group, 15 cases in the placebo group, translating to 100 percent efficacy. Don't let that number fool you. I would have put a confidence interval on this. If I had been Moderna, I think they may be there, I'm not sure how they're calculating their confidence intervals here. So because there are only 15 cases total in this subgroup, the uncertainty here is much higher. So maybe it's something like 70 to 100 percent or something like that. But nevertheless, you can't actually do better than what they did here. Every single case occurred in a placebo patient among the 65 and older. So very encouraging findings there. Okay. These are subgroup analyses. So like what we looked at before, but now broken down into even more categories. So there's the same younger people, good efficacy. There's the 100 percent in the 65 to 75 year old age group. And then 100 percent in the 75 and older, don't get too excited. Three cases in the placebo group versus zero in the vaccine group. Again, as good as you can get, all three cases occurred in the placebo group, but not enough data to say that this is going to be 100 percent effective. In fact, I can promise you it's not going to be 100 percent effective because nothing ever is. We just need to accrue more data. But this still, we'll take it, right? Then it breaks down in terms of risk group and things like that. But if you just are sort of scanning down the right, you can look at this in more detail on your own. We're going to see that across all these important criteria, you're still seeing 90s and 100 percent efficacy, right? 94 percent in women, 95 percent in men, racial breakdown looks pretty good. Hispanic, non-Hispanic, etc. Black or African American, 100 percent efficacy, only four cases in the placebo group, zero in the vaccine group, can't expect better, but still not a very precise estimate. These are still early results, super promising, but early. All right. This table 11 looks at the characteristics of people who actually got COVID, so the five people in the vaccine group and the 90 people in the placebo group. We've seen data on who's at risk to get COVID before. I don't think it's particularly interesting. You can take a look at it in your own time. All right, table 12, interesting. Some of these people enrolled in this trial had already had SARS. It's had already had COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 had already had COVID-19. They're breaking down efficacy here. What you can see is you've got overall the pretty solid efficacy, 94 percent, among the people who had a positive, positive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, so previously infected, you do see 100 percent efficacy. But look, there's only one case in the placebo group. This would be a recurrent infection. We know recurrent infections happen, and so here is one. There was zero case in the vaccine group. Again, as good as you can get, that's 100 percent efficacy, but very uncertain. Just not enough numbers there as of yet. Nor would we expect there to be, because we would expect that prior infection is somewhat protective. Looking down here at table 13, this is efficacy by those risk predefined risk factors. This is some really important data in this table. The risk factors that aren't very prevalent look at something like HIV. Yeah, we'll take 100 percent. But again, just one case in the vaccinated group compared to zero out of 80. I'm sorry, one case in the placebo group compared to zero out of 80 in the vaccine group. The one I was really worried about was obesity, because this is one where you can make the argument biologically that maybe they need a higher dose of vaccine or something like that if you're obese. No evidence of that here. Two cases in the vaccinated group, 46, that's how to BMI of greater than 30. If we look at severe obesity, BMI greater than 41 cases in the vaccine group, 11 cases in the placebo group, that's still 91 percent efficacy. So, it doesn't look like you're going to need higher doses in people with an elevated BMI of this vaccine. All right. Severe cases at the interim analysis. To be a severe COVID case, you had to test positive for COVID and require oxygen or get hospitalized. None of those in the vaccine group, 11 of the placebo groups, so 100 percent in terms of preventing severe COVID infections. This is critical when we think about avoiding overloading our hospital system and stuff. We really want to see a decrease in severe COVID infections. So pretty good. All right. Here's our cumulative incidence curve. So in red, you see the vaccinated people and in blue, you see the control group. And if I squint, I can even put a little bit of curve on the blue group, which suggests that there's kind of an increasing incidence over time, which would match the population demographics. We were in kind of the upswing when this trial ended in the fall. We continued being on the upswing, but let's not worry about that too much. We've got a nice flat line here for the vaccinated group. Now, a lot of people are going to be squinting at this and trying to decide if a single dose is going to be protective or not. Remember, people here were getting their second dose around 28 days, around here. And there does seem to be separation. There does seem to be some efficacy with a single dose between day 10 and day 28 or so. Okay. Here is where things get interesting. So table 15 is efficacy among the people who only received one dose of the vaccine. Now, we got to be a little careful here, right? Because like, why did they only receive one dose of the vaccine? You know, is this a different population of people? Is something weird here? We're going to need more details. But if you want to know if one dose is protective, this gives us some information, okay? So what it tells us is immediately after one dose, the efficacy is 80 percent. Now, that's not as good as the overall efficacy they report, but it's not really a fair comparison because we don't think you should be immune the moment you get the vaccine, right? You have to build up your immunity. So that's really fascinating to me. And we need to see some more data here. So then they say, look at this, greater than 14 days after dose one. So we've got about 1,000 people in each group who only got one dose of the vaccine. And then they're looking at how many infections happened greater than 14 days after dose one. So that's after you'd have had plenty of time to generate your immunity if you got the vaccine. And you only see two infections here compared to 28 in the placebo group for an efficacy of 92 percent. That is something. Now, that is a good argument that one dose might be protective of this vaccine. I don't know if the FDA will buy it, but man, it is certainly something to think about. I definitely want to see the population characteristics of this group though. Okay. In terms of preventing severe COVID-19 after one dose, well, we've got, so same question after one dose, you've got two cases versus four cases, only 42 percent efficacy here. Not enough cases and a little bit concerning, right? Because we really want to prevent severe COVID-19 if we can. In fact, you can argue that that's the whole goal. Like, I don't care if people have kind of the sniffles, right? Like, I care about them going to the hospital. So interesting stuff there. All right. Keep in going. Table 17, final efficacy analysis. So this is new data. This is updated from, I think the original press release. So just more cases, basically they had more time to accrue more cases. And what you can see is you've got a total of 11 cases in the vaccine group and 185 in the placebo group. So way better in the vaccine group, 94 percent efficacy with a confidence interval ranging from 90 to 97 percent. That is really strong. You see similar numbers in the 18 to under 65 group. A little bit numerically lower here, 86.4 percent in the 65 and older group. The confidence intervals pretty wide. 60 to 95 percent basically because there just aren't that many. There aren't enough patients here to really know. So this may not be different or it could be our first hint that the vaccine isn't quite as efficacious in older people. We just don't know. But even so, 86 percent is nothing to sneeze at. That is a good efficacy number. Check this out. Severe COVID-19 cases now, the final date or the updated date is zero in the vaccine group. 30 in the placebo group. That is awesome. What about those two patients that you mentioned before in the vaccine group, I'd say, COVID-19. Remember, that was in the group that only got one dose of the vaccine. So this is among people who got two doses of the vaccine and starting counting severe cases, 14 days after the dose of vaccine or placebo. So that's why you get zero cases here. These people are fully immunized as you might imagine. So still, I think there's still an argument for two doses here. I'd be surprised if FDA pushes for one dose personally. All right, let's talk about safety. Man, they gave us a lot of interesting safety data here. So let's just walk through this really quickly. So solicited safety events is the study is asking you about it. Like, hey, does your arm hurt? Hey, do you have a fever? Hey, do you have chills, et cetera? And you can see that rate is 95 percent of people say yes to at least one of those questions in the vaccine group, just 60 percent in the placebo group, still 60 percent for placebo, right? What's really interesting about this table is that they do stratify by whether people had COVID-19 in the past or not. And the reason that's important is because there's been concern that if you were already infected, could administering the vaccine, like, rev up your immune system even more and make side effects worse or something like that. And you don't see that here. 95 percent in the people who weren't previously infected compared to 82 percent among those who were previously infected. So if anything, it looks a little bit better. Local adverse reaction. So that's in your arm. You've got 92 percent not much in the placebo group. Injection site reaction, 9 percent versus 0.9 percent. Inject adverse reaction. Those are things like fever, chills, muscle aches, 83 percent versus 53 percent and then grade 3 or 4. So like the ones that are pretty serious, a pretty uncomfortable 16 percent versus 4 percent in placebo. So you definitely see that here. I often pay more attention to the unsolicited adverse events. And the reason is because those are the ones that the participants are like concerned enough about that they tell you about. Or it happens to them, like death is an unsolicited adverse event. But tends to give you a better picture of are these symptoms really bad. And again, here you see so the numbers are lower because the participants have to mention it. 22 percent versus 20 percent not too bad. If we look at grade 3, the higher, the more severe adverse events, not bad 1 percent versus 1 percent. What's thought related to the vaccine, so the way related and unrelated works is study investigators not told whether the patient got vaccine or placebo, but whatever the event is, they have to decide, oh, this could have been related to the thing that they got. So if it's like, oh, there are really hurts. They'd be like, yeah, that was probably related. If it's like, oh, they got in a car accident, they we did usually say it's probably not related, you know, unless I don't know something weird, something weird happened. All right, so I'm going to look, you know, briefly down here and we don't see a ton, you know, 8 percent. These are pretty balanced between the groups. Serious adverse events are the ones we often care about 82 versus 86 in placebo, which is really fine. No difference in the people that were previously infected. And then related serious adverse events, five versus four. It's just not that bad. We've got eight deaths total in the entire study population for in each arm. This is expected. This is a 30,000 person trial. People do die. This is about the rate you'd expect of just deaths happening because deaths happen in a population this size over this period of time. None of the deaths were deemed to be related to receiving vaccine or placebo. Adverse events leading to discontinuation, strangely enough, higher in the placebo group than the vaccine group, which is interesting. I'm not sure how to parse that. Usually you see it higher in the active drug group. This is a similar breakdown among people who are greater than age 65. And it honestly looks quite a bit the same. I think we're going to expect the same rate of adverse events, regardless of age here. This table 21 starts breaking it down a little bit more into the types of adverse events. And it by dose. So dose one, dose two, placebo, dose one, placebo, dose two. And broadly what you see here is that there is an increase in adverse events. After dose two in the vaccine group. So there's pain. Everyone kind of complains of pain and some redness. But look, 3 percent with redness here, 9 percent of redness after number two, 6 percent with swelling after dose one, 12 percent after dose two. And if you look at, oh, sorry, this is the same thing with people greater than age 65. Let me bring them all together for systemic. Okay. So let's look at systemic adverse reactions. This is in the under age 65 group. And for example, let's take fever. 0.9 percent after vaccine dose one, which is similar to placebo, 17.4 percent after vaccine dose two compared to basically nothing at placebo. You're definitely feeling worse after vaccine dose two. Look at headache, 35 percent 62 percent after dose two. Fatigue 38 versus 67, placebo sitting around 30 percent. My alge, that's muscle aches. It seemed to be the only thing that decrease after vaccination, although the severe myeloges, severe muscle aches goes up from very rare to 10 percent. So you're going to get some muscle aches. You're going to get some joint aches. All of these are getting worse after the second dose. So if you're a physician, you're a healthcare provider, tell your patients, it looks like dose two is going to be the tough one, the one that you really feel. Check out chills, by the way. 9 percent after the initial dose, 48 percent after the second dose. These are solicited adverse reactions on this table. They were saying, hey, did you have chills? And it's different, if you say yes, I had chills compared to if you tell someone of your own accord that you had chills, that's something to think about. But still, I think we're having some bigger reactions after dose two here. And this is the same table, but among the over 65 group. If anything, the numbers look a little better, like the headache, the fever, the myeloges, all appear to be a little bit lower in this group. So maybe they're having a little bit less of those adverse events. This is breaking into the unsolicited adverse events in a slightly larger population of the patients than in the purplocal analysis. And you basically don't see anything terribly interesting here. They're all pretty similar between the vaccine and the placebo group. And in fact, they're more dropouts in the placebo group than the vaccine group. Okay. Where are these adverse events coming? Events that occur in more than 1 percent of the vaccine group participants. So we've got any infection here and then severe infection here. So we're just going to look at severe and kind of compare it to placebo. And I'm seeing, you know, infections, no difference, really nervous system, no difference, skin, no difference. What am I missing? Muscle. So our thralloges and myeloges definitely, definitely more in the vaccine group here. Fatigue looks like it's going to be more injection site pain more. Otherwise, you know, I'm not seeing anything that we didn't entirely expect here. Let's look at serious adverse events that the investigators thought were related to the administration of the study drug. So this is either vaccine or placebo. Not many here. There's seven in the vaccine group, five in the placebo group. So not that many in a study of 30,000 people. Nausea vomiting, facial swelling, rheumatoid arthritis, shortness of breath. This is autonomic dysfunction. That's like dizziness or drops in blood pressure when you stand B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma. By the way, just the fact that the investigator says it's related doesn't mean it is that it can be proven. It's just that can they think that there's a reason that it could happen. So they might see someone with B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma and say, oh, well, you know, I know the drug is boosting the immune system. So there could be something, you know, linked there. And then placebo, you get polymyldromatic, facial swelling, hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction. These are all just things that, you know, are happening in the general population. There's a concern that the mRNA vaccines might engender some sort of autoimmunity. So I noticed one autoimmune condition in placebo, polymyldromatic. I noticed one, two, I think autoimmune conditions if we consider autonomic dysfunction, potentially autoimmune, two autoimmune serious adverse events in the vaccine group. These are rare events. You're not going to get enough to be certain if there's a causal link here in a trial of this size. We're going to need to do, we're going to need to follow these events over time as we vaccinate the population. We need to use the vaccine adverse event reporting system to track these. Pregnancy is okay. So you weren't allowed to be in the study if you were pregnant, but 13 women became pregnant during the study, six and vaccine, seven placebo. And all we know about them is that there was a spontaneous abortion and an elective abortion both in the placebo group and that's it. So really no data on vaccine safety or efficacy in pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about that. Okay. Important to see what Moderna thinks they are going to do if they get an EUA. They're saying here that they're evaluating the opportunity to amend the protocol to proactively reconsent patients who receive placebo to be offered vaccine and to remain in the trial, enabling Moderna to continue to collect the relevant safety and effectiveness data over the entire two years of follow-up on increasing the likelihood of retaining participants on trial. Amend the protocol to proactively reconsent patients who receive placebo to be offered ever. So they're not telling us when they're going to do that. More extensive purchase of Moderna would be expected also to be greater. So I'm not sure. The question is, are they going to give them vaccine now or are they going to give them vaccine later? I don't know. We'll keep out for it. I'm writing a piece now arguing that all these placebo patients should get vaccine right now. As soon as the EUA goes through and you'll see that up on this YouTube channel. So I'm going to stop here for now. This is good data folks. This is strong efficacy data across a variety of subgroups. People serious adverse events, but a lot of side effects particularly after dose two. So prepare yourselves for that if you're getting this vaccine. You might feel fine after dose one. And then when you get that second dose, it might put you down under the weather for a day or so. So be aware of that. Thanks so much for watching. I feel like this sort of stuff. I talk about medical studies all the time on this channel. And you can like and subscribe and turn on notifications and things. And I post about once a week about a study that is interesting to me. So thanks a lot. Take care. See you next time."
How does Moderna's new vaccine work?,TRT World,2020-11-18,zREC4xF93qY,"US-based Moderna Therapeutics has announced that their COVID-19 vaccine was found to be nearly 95 percent effective in its preliminary analysis. The announcement comes just one week after Pfizer announced that its COVID-19 vaccine, developed in partnership with German-based Biontech, was found to be over 90 percent effective in its preliminary analysis. The news from Moderna Therapeutics sent stock market soaring, with Moderna shares closing 9.6 percent stronger, and the Dow Jones index reaching record-setting highs. But as promising as these results are, it's important to note that they're only the preliminary readings from the first interim analysis of Moderna's Phase 3 COV studies into vaccine efficacy, and that's quite a mouthful. But basically, COV is Moderna's acronym for its coronavirus efficacy and safety study, and according to their latest press releases, Phase 3 trials of the MRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine enrolled more than 30,000 participants in the US, and has been conducted in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as part of President Trump's Operation Warp Speed Vaccine Development Program, from which it received nearly $1 billion to support research and development. The study has made efforts to be as inclusive as possible, with more than 7,000 participants over the age of 65, 5,000 or so who are under 65 but have high risk chronic diseases such as diabetes, severe obesity, and cardiac disease, which make them high risk candidates for contracting COVID-19. The study is also being carried out in communities that have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials, including over 6,000 people who identify as Latinx or Hispanic, and over 3,000 people who identify as being black. Taking all that into consideration, the first interim analysis included 95 participants that represented the diversity of the overall sample size, and all of which were confirmed cases of COVID-19. Side effects were noted, and they ranged from mild to moderate and severity and were short-lived. They include fatigue, slight headaches, and pain at the injection site. But it was the results of this analysis, which included 95 people that amounted to a 94.5 percent efficacy and rate. Moderna therapeutics also mentioned in its press release that the data is subject to change based on ongoing analysis of further phase 3 COVID studies, but that these initial interim results, despite being from a relatively small sample size, were proof that their method of mRNA vaccine delivery was effective and possibly the best choice moving forward regarding further vaccines and therapies. But how exactly does their mRNA 1273 COVID-19 vaccine work? When China released the genetic sequence for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus on January 10, Moderna's science and research teams started developing an mRNA vaccine that works a little differently than traditional ones. Their scientists were able to extract a part of the genetic sequence of the virus that allowed it to infect human cells and create a harmless version of it in the lab. This so-called spike protein antigen is what allows the virus to infect human cells and replicate, killing them off in the process. In certain, a harmless version of it evokes an immune response in the body that allows white blood cells to create specific antibodies to prevent antigens from attaching to human cells and stop the virus from spreading. This approach to mRNA vaccines is similar to what's being developed by Pfizer and Biontech and the number of biotechnology companies around the world. And the results have far exceeded expectations, and consequently, Moderna therapeutics intends to submit an emergency use authorization to the US Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks. Furthermore, Moderna's vaccine can remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius for up to 30 days and can be stored in a standard freezer at temperatures of around minus 20 degrees Celsius for six months. And it also requires no mixing or dilution prior to administering, meaning that distribution and storage can be more accessible, especially since Pfizer and Biontech's vaccines still requires industrial-level refrigeration at minus 70 degrees Celsius. By the end of 2020, Moderna therapeutics expects to have approximately 20 million doses of the mRNA 1273 vaccine ready to ship in the US and remains on track to manufacture 500 million to 1 billion doses globally in 2021."
"FDA authorizes Moderna, J&J Covid boosters as Pfizer posts new efficacy data",CNBC Television,2021-10-21,U1c4xaEAOZ4,"We have some breaking news involving the Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot. Companies say a Phase III trial shows high efficacy for the booster against the virus and of course some of the variants which by the way are just the virus. Now, Meg Terel joining us now with more and Meg will be a little bit confusing because we know the booster already exists. But I'm assuming and please just tell me I'm right because if I'm wrong I gotta go back and correct myself. That this would be the booster for everybody, not just for sort of the elderly or those who are immunocompromised. Well, this is the booster that could be for everybody. Currently the Pfizer folks are only authorized in those specific groups. And let's actually go over that because last night we got the word from the FDA that boosters for everybody or at least the groups for each vaccine have been authorized. So now Moderna and J&J folks are on track to be able to get boosters too. And this is how it breaks down. Essentially for J&J everybody two months out can go get another booster. And it is basically any booster that they want. They can mix and match. They can get Pfizer. They can get another J&J or they can get a half dose of Moderna. Now Moderna boosters were also authorized last night for folks six months out in those high risk groups. Either people over 65 or at high risk because of their health or their exposure risk. And again Moderna folks can get Pfizer J&J or a half dose Moderna. Same goes for Pfizer. This morning what we got from Pfizer was efficacy data from their trial of the booster. So so far what we had seen was antibody data on Pfizer's booster. This is actually showing that it can prevent COVID cases. So it was a 10,000 person trial. The median time between the booster dose and haven't gotten the second shot was 11 months. So that's farther out than most people are getting boosters right now. It showed 96 percent efficacy against COVID. The way they found that was that people who got boasted there were only five cases of COVID in that group versus 109 in people who were not boosted. And they said no safety concerns were identified. So this is the first sort of real world evidence we are seeing from a clinical trial showing how well a booster can prevent COVID in the United States. So far all the data we've been using have been on antibodies. Guys this is really interesting data that the CDC just started publishing. And the CDC is meeting today with its advisors to give guidance on how people should be using these booster doses. These data may play into it. It's the first time we've seen the CDC breakout efficacy from real world data against COVID by vaccine type. So the main takeaway here this is cases. If you're not vaccinated, you have a much higher risk of getting COVID obviously. And then you can see that there is a slight difference between J and J Pfizer and Moderna. Moderna being the green there and this is deaths where you can see a similar trend there. Moderna in this case being a white so the colors are slightly different. So guys CDC's advisors are talking today about all of this. We hope to get more guidance for everybody back over to you."
"FDA approves booster shot, Moderna’s vaccine effectiveness on variants, Facebook delays RTO",Yahoo Finance,2021-08-13,SbY9TLFGWrI,"Let's start our attention now to the pandemic and continuing news out of the FDA and some encouraging news that we got out of Moderna yesterday as well. Yahoo! Finance's Anja Kamlani joins us for the latest updates on the COVID-19 pandemic, aren't we? That's right, Miles. We know that the FDA really just at the 11th hour last night came down with the expected emergency use authorization tweaks for both Moderna and Pfizer, allowing that third shot that booster jab for immunocompromised individuals. Now that's just one part of the process. The next part is the CDC Advisory Committee, which is meeting today in about an hour to start the discussion and then eventually vote on what that definition is going to be of immunocompromised individuals. Meanwhile, the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services already announced that Medicare members will be allowed to get that third jab if they qualify, if they are immunocompromised. Now this, the definition that's been loosely used in reports is individuals who either have cancer or other diseases that suppress their immunity are on medications that suppress their immunity or are organ donor recipients. So all of those should be part of the conversation and we'll have more on that later, but as it stands right now, two shots, two companies at least have been given the green light to go ahead for that booster shot. And at the same time, there's this new study as we get concerned about the delta variant. There seems to be a new study that the Moderna shot as it exists is somewhat effective against the delta variant. What do we know about that and what do we know about is there anything we can extrapolate about that study for Pfizer since they're both mRNA vaccines? Right, well, we've already heard this from both companies that they know that their vaccine does protect six months out. This this study that came out just verifies that information. We'd already heard from both companies that this was true, but what it does set up is the conversation about durability. We know that we're talking about vaccine mandates and others right now around the country, whether it is at the state level or at the school level or even with companies. And so speaking of that, we know that Indiana University just yesterday won a legal battle with a Supreme Justice, Amy Coney Barrett deciding to side with the university against eight students who were trying to overturn a vaccine mandate that goes into effect this fall semester. So the the repercussions for that are that 90,000 students and 40,000 employees will have to get their vaccines or lose either their classes or their jobs as a result. There are religious and medical exemptions for that. And those who qualify will have to get tested twice a week as a result. Meanwhile, we're hearing from Facebook who is now going to push back a return to office until next year following suit from Amazon and lift. And those companies are just the first after delaying a return to office because of the Delta variant. So a lot going on there and keeping a watch on how the vaccine mandates stack up and help to increase vaccination rates here in the country. All right, Yahoo! Finances, I'm Julie Kimlin with the latest on the COVID-19 pandemic."
Moderna CEO Says Covid-19 Vaccine a ‘Game Changer’,Bloomberg Television,2020-11-17,R0RIeG8DMbE,"The biggest question, though, that it seems like people have is why does your vaccine require less cold storage than Pfizer key to distribution? Yes, good morning, and thank you for having me. I think it goes back to the fact that we have been working on mRNA vaccines for more than five years. This is the 10th vaccine that we have been running a clinical trial on. The other vaccine that you mentioned, it's the first time that they are doing an infectious disease vaccine. And so over the years, we've invested heavily in science, in process development that allows us now to have a much better storage condition than what we used to have five years ago. Stefan, this is really important because it's going to have a huge impact on distribution. How much of an effect will that stability at a higher temperature have in everybody's ability to be able to get hold of this vaccine? I think it's a huge impact. We're going to have a vaccine stored at minus 20 between our factory and the big distribution centers. And those are able to handle that type of product because they're already product approved by the EMEA in Europe, METCHI in the UK or FD in the US at minus 20 Celsius. But what is very important with today's news is we can now fork to 30 days have a vaccine stored in a regular fridge at 2 to 8 Celsius, like you do insulin. And as you know, every pharmacy, you know, doctor's office, hospital has that capability. So we think it's a very important game changer. The other piece too, to keep in mind is our vaccine does not require dilution. The other vaccine that you mentioned requires dilution at the site. So you take the vaccine out, they need to dilute it. It's an extra step what we have to do to get the world back to normal is a massive vaccination campaign that never really happened before. And so every time we're going to be wasting doing these type of things for our product is going to be an issue. And so we think that between the fridge condition storage and the fact that we do not require any dilution on site, there's going to be a big advantage for nurses and doctors to be able to provide those vaccines quickly to the population we want it. Such a good distinction. Have you had conversations with the current administration or the incoming Biden administration about kind of distribution and how to mobilize? Yes, so the operational web speed has been working in the US very closely with the CDC for a long time. And we are in daily discussions with them what we're going to do as soon as we got an approval or an EUA by the US FDA is to ship the product via Macassan with the US government as selected because they are very active in the seasonal flu process. To get the vaccines out to a hospital and pharmacies, I'm sure you read CBS, Walgreens, Writer, all the big pharmacy changes in the US have signed up to get the vaccine from Macassan to provide administration in the pharmacies. This is going to be available in hospitals, in some rural areas, in community hospitals, GP's office. So there's a lot of work going on and this is actually the government taking care of that step, whereas the military is being involved to help with logistics. Stefan, one of the key questions as we all watch the case count climbing around the world is what impact will these shots have on transmission. So what effect, if I have this in my arm, will this have on my ability, if I come into contact to get the virus to transmit it to others? Yes, and this we don't know yet. What we know from today's data is that if you get a vaccine, you're going to have a 94 percent chance to have no COVID disease. That's obviously a big deal. But what is even more important in my opinion is of a 95 case of disease that were analyzed yesterday by the independent NIH lead safety board was severe cases, which was the secondary end point of that phase three study. So 11 of the 95 cases were severe, but what is really remarkable is that of those 11 cases, 11 where with people who got placebo, there were no case reported of people who get the modern vaccine. So when you put those two data together, what does it tell you? With the data we have to there, it seems that our vaccine, if you get it, you have very high chance of being with no disease. And if you get disease, most probably you'll get mild disease. And if you think about the impact on hospitalization, I see you and the impact on the economy, where governments around the world are trying to slow down contacts because they want to manage the limited hospital and ICU capacity. So if that problem was to go away by having a vaccine that prevents severe disease like ours seem to do, that's a game changer. To your question about transmission, we will know soon as part of our study, we're also looking at measuring antibodies that come from the virus, but could not come from the vaccine. And so when we have that data, we'll of course share it. It is possible that the vaccine will prevent infection. We have shown that in non-human primate, I mean monkeys, but we need of course to prove it in human now, just in a bit more time. But the most important thing is to prevent disease. If people vaccinated will not have disease, we will be in a very different world. What's the breakdown for the general population versus older people, say those over 65? You had 15 in the trial, right? So what was placebo, which were vaccinated? What was the effect? Yeah, we don't know already tells yet because remember the company is blinded. The data is is on and run by the independent safety ball. But what we know is that we had only five active cases on the drug. And so we anticipate a good response in the elderly. We will know more in a couple of weeks when we have the study finalised and filed to BFDA and the MHI in the UK. But if you look at the phase one data which were published in the New England, we're actually the vaccine of older vaccines in the clinic that was able to sustain from a 25 year old to a 75 year old, the same level of antibody for all of the participant in the study. So we are constantly optimistic that in the elderly and other people with high commodity factor, we should have an effective vaccine. Stefan, Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, was asked the other day what her greatest fear was. One of them was war, the other one was the MIMC. How big a fear do you have about mutation? And is RM, messenger Robin E. Claire asked the best way of dealing with any kind of mutation that we see? So let me start with your last question. Yes, mRNA is the best technology to deal with mutation while. Because we've shown in January that it took us 42 days to go from the sequence published by the Chinese government of the SARS-CoV-2 to shipping to VNH, human grade quality product. I think we can take this down to around 30 days with the things we've learned and the investment we have made. So if tomorrow there was a new mutation, like the one you mentioned, that could have an impact on the efficacy of a vaccine, we could within a month go back and have a new vaccine. We will not need to do studies anymore because it's the same chemistry for the molecular mRNA. It's the same manufacturing process. So if you change out of a message that is very long thousands of letters of genetic code of life, if you change a couple of them for mutation, you do not have to redo clinical studies anymore. So mRNA is clearly the best adapted for mutation. On the one you mentioned, we are tracking it. We're going to run the experiment very quickly to see does the blood that we have from the humans we wear on our face one and our face two? Does it neutralize the new virus? If it does, we know the vaccine works well. If it doesn't, we can quickly change the sequence and have a new vaccine. Can you give me some perspective on the side effects? Yes, the side effects we've reported, the severe side effects in a particular list for transparency reason, they are very similar to what you see with over vaccines. We didn't even report the fever because they were less than 2 percent of cases at fever. And what you see is what you see with commercial vaccine, a bit of pain at the site of injection, a bit of renaissance for the R2, both go away with no medication. And at the systemic level, you see some people having some fatigue, especially in the elderly group, you see people having a bit of headache. Again, those things go away, usually within a day or so, with no medication. Of course, people can take a Tylenol or equivalent and actually not even feel those pains. So Van, you mentioned a moment ago about being able to reformulate. How quickly do you think you'll get into 2.0, 3.0? How quickly do you think that cycle will happen? And what improvements do you think you'll be looking for? You mentioned temperature earlier on as being one of the critical factors. As you look for reformulations, what work are you doing and how improved will be the product and how quickly? Yes, that's a great question. I think we're of course always working on temperature and stability. The 30 days we're known today at free temperature is a first step forward because we have that data. We continue to monitor the product that is on stability in other products. It's multidose. So in every mile, you're going to get 10 doses for 10 people. And the reason the entire industry did that is very not enough filling capacity in the world that was sitting idle to wait for a pandemic. And so by putting 10 doses in one mile, we can of course get much quicker product in the marketplace to vaccinate people. But if you think about the potential use for the mid to long term in terms of boosting, it will be much easier to have a single dose vaccination like you have when you get a seasonal flu shot. Stefan, I find a question from me. As you said at the beginning of this conversation, you've been working on this for a long time. You were looking to use messenger RNA for other therapies. Can you talk to me about the acceleration you've been through within your business as a result of COVID-19? And I'm looking for silver linings here. Will this help in treatments elsewhere? Will it help with cancer and other areas? Yes, some of the place where it's going to help the most is in infectious disease vaccine. We have six vaccines for over infectious disease that are all first in class, meaning no commercial vaccine available. A good example is CMV C2 Megalo virus. It's a virus that drives the number one cause of birth defects in Europe or in the US. 10,000 kids in the US per year. No vaccine on the market. The world industry has tried for 20 years to get a CMV vaccine to work. They all failed. Well, we have a positive phase two study in September, starting the phase three next year. That's a two to five billion annual pixel product that we have not licensed. So meaning it's a product 100 percent for Moderna. And we have many more like this. We just announced we're going to get into the flu business. So what the COVID vaccine has done for Moderna is one, de-resking of a platform for vaccines, which translate into a lot of value. And two is an acceleration for us becoming a commercial company. We were supposed to be commercial in the 23 to 24 time frame. Well, now it's possible we are being commercial before the another year."
Moderna's vaccine efficacy is 'stunning': Former Medtronic CEO,CNBC Television,2020-11-16,5HlWv8JGU6M,"What do you find most interesting the efficacy the supply the storage specs that Meg was just talking about or something else? I'm very excited about the efficacy because you were called the FDA criteria was 50 percent Well, I'm not sure that gives me confidence flying an airplane full of people and go to Europe for example So I think 90 90 percent 94.5 this is stunning now admittedly this has got to be confirmed When we look at all the data and complete all the trials, but I think having two major companies coming out back to back and Tells us that we're going to get there. We're going to get there also with supply carl and again I want to give credit to the Trump administration's operation warp speed because they funded these people in advance Not just for R&D in this case with a billion dollars of R&D But also they gave the contract which you'd always get for the 100 million to start 400 million option to follow and I think you'll see what Jay and Jay coming in the AstraZeneca. We're gonna have multiple vaccines Which is very good news that's just an American public for people around the world It will ease the distribution issues now as you said they're not going to get out there before The end of the first quarter or second quarter, but that's that's very good because this is key to unlocking the economy We can't get the economy going fully until we have a vaccine that people feel confident and if they feel marginally confident They won't engage in big events and we come to a very critical time because of the disease is ramping up so quickly right now And we don't know where this rapid ramp up of being indoors is gonna end because all the curves I see are like straight up and That's very very worrisome to all the medical doctors last week Carol. I was down in But in person with doctors on Rico Perugio the CEO has been on the show many times in talking about this and he said you know We know now that it works this MM RNA technology works. There'll be others that work We feel confident we do want to look at all the data all the subgroups and see answers see if we can answer the very question you raised Is it truly preventing disease or is it just keeping it from harming us but we'll learn a lot more later But I think we move ahead with the EUA and I think the FDA is a very sound procedure in place to do that Well, we look forward to seeing that request made it really in the coming weeks I do wonder you know Fauci this morning Bill said that General population no core morbidities people like you and me probably are looking at April So between now and April what does the debate look like about Movement restrictions about mask wearing because it's gonna get a little more cloudy if some people will say look I don't need to do that. I've already gotten the vaccine Let me say Carol first of all that Finding a vaccine for a novel coronavirus is extremely difficult science and the fact that so many companies are working on it and Getting results just shows the power of American innovation Moderna is basically a very small company and they've done it and Pfizer team of the German company bio and Ben and we see the power of innovation on the one hand now having said that I'm very concerned that We don't get control over right now. So let's get back to easy things easy thing is wearing a mask Staying six feet apart from other people and not going to large groups We're gonna have to do that for the next four five six months until we all get vaccinated. Yeah, anything else is fully Along those lines and and thinking about The way forward the Trump administration kudos to them for operation warp speed But they're not cooperating with President-elect Biden's transition team on matters of COVID-19 or Other things does that concern you at all from a virus policy standpoint? Of course, it's a huge mistake. They need to be working in tandem like the Obama administration work of the Trump administration and the Bush Administration work with Obama Absolutely and particularly now we didn't have a pandemic then we had a financial crisis back in O.A They work together very closely and I think that's essential that they do that and that Biden has appointed his own coronavirus task force very confident people I reviewed the people on there very capable like Mike Osterholm And so I think they need to work together openly science is open. It's got to be available to everyone and Yeah, it concerns me. I think that'll ease after a little while the Georgia recount some of these other votes become solidified and the Electors start voting. I think that'll ease off and I think they'll back away from that and recognize that President-elect Biden is is going to be taking over and to work closely with this team I'm more optimistic that that will be allowed to happen But it's going to cost us vital weeks right now. We have no time to waste look at the rapid escalation I think the average Number of infection the U.S. is up over 140,000 days Shepherd Smith here. Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube"
"Moderna Vaccine Has 94.5% Efficacy, Trial Analysis Shows",Bloomberg Television,2020-11-16,GcIITCPPcZk,"Can you compare what we've learned from Moderna this morning and contrast that with what we learned from Pfizer last week? Yes, good morning, John. Can I just first say that this is... I was a little bit of a... I'm kind of speechless to a degree. At this level of efficacy, I was really getting ready for a 70-80 percent. Because there are differences between these vaccines. 94.5 percent. I'm not going to call this better than Pfizer because this is... We're dealing with such few cases. But thank God it's higher than that number rather than below it. And we get more from these guys. We're getting more with regards to the statistics. You see that p-value they're putting there, which is pretty powerful, which is not a surprise. We're also hearing that the 11 severe cases so far were all unpleasable when you read further down. That's great. And if that carries on being in the case, we'll be very happy. And lastly, they do tell us that 15 people in the trial in the 95 cases were older adults. But it doesn't tell us which groups they were in, the vaccinated or the placebo. So that's one little thing that we'd love to know. San, the 23-mile difference from Moderna and Cambra, a jot to and over in Pfizer's refrigerators is a difference between negative 94 degrees and his Lisa mentioned the refrigeration headlines. Are all of a sudden messenger RNA? Is it all of a sudden more distributable worldwide, simply because of the freezing to refrigeration path? I mean, that's pretty much as simple as it gets. The question for that press release that first came up from Moderna. It actually incremental. We knew already that the storage and distribution was a minus 20. We knew that it was okay to keep it in the fridge at the 2 to 8 degrees for a certain period of time. They've just extended that and we're going to get more as time goes by about how long these things can be kept. And it just makes the use of the vaccine easier at the point of at the end of the line. And of course, it's already an easier vaccine to distribute than Pfizer. I mean, this is importantly. So right now we're confusing everyone because I refuse to quote Celsius. And Dr. Foselli refuses to quote Fahrenheit. It's clear isn't it Lisa? Yeah, well, it makes it a lot easier to get the Moderna vaccine out and distributed if you don't have to have cold ice on the side here. I am wondering whether we can take a 30,000 person study where we're talking about sample sizes of five people or 11 people Sam and extrapolate that out into something that can really immunize an entire world population. Is this sufficient in your eyes? Well, it's a start. And I think this is what I've been saying with regards to the Pfizer already. These are not these are not the levels of effectiveness that we expected at this point. Everyone was psychologically mentally preparing themselves for 50 60 70 percent, which would have been good. But this is level that nobody expected. So again, as I say, we've taken the first step. We've thrown the first set of dice and we got two sixes. It's a great great start. Sam, just a final question from me just to wrap things up. Is there a difference in providing this information and a press release compared to a peer reviewed journal? Can you compare and contrast that just that approach and how this information is being distributed into the public? Yes, the absolute level. I mean, you have to give it out because it takes time to prepare these documents to get them published. You need to know how the two groups, how well the two groups were balanced. If there were lots of people with comorbidities in the placebo group, which therefore didn't respond to the vaccine as well. I doubt that's the case because it are already large numbers, but you do need to see that."
Moderna requests vaccine go ahead after ‘highly efficacious’ data,Al Jazeera English,2020-11-30,6rWc08WoJV8,"A second coronavirus vaccine now awaiting approval by US regulators. Moderna announced its vaccine is ready and if approved for emergency use, the company will start rolling out the first doses of the vaccine by late December. We have worked very closely with Operation Varspeed and as we said, we should have up to 20 million doses by the end of a year. So as soon as we get approval, General Kahnani's teams are going to get hold of a vaccine we have and start shipping it in the country. His goal is to vaccinate Americans within 24 hours from approval. Moderna is a small pharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that has never successfully brought a vaccine to market. It got a big jump on its competitors because it started working aggressively on a COVID vaccine back in January. The very day, China released the genetic data on the coronavirus. That early foresight is now paying off. The company saying it hopes to produce as many as 500 million COVID vaccine doses next year alone. Earlier this month, New York based vaccine maker Pfizer and its German partner, Bayon Tech, announced its vaccine was also being submitted for approval and could roll out 50 million doses this year. With Pfizer, we at the FDA announced an advisory committee for December 10th and if everything is on track, everything proves out what what it appears to be, we could be looking at approval within days after that. Moderna is basically one week behind that. Distribution of the vaccines could be a challenge that is fast approaching. The vaccines must be kept in cold temperatures at all times during transport and storage or face the risk of spoiling and being ineffective. But it doesn't matter how many vaccines are available. If people decide they don't want to take them. Here in the United States, one poll showed that nearly 40 percent of Americans said they have no plans to take the coronavirus vaccine. And within minority communities, particularly blacks and Latinos, the distrust runs even deeper with the same poll showing that nearly half said when it comes to the vaccine, no thanks. On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said more outreach needs to be done to build trust with minorities to take the vaccine. Blacks died at twice the rate that whites died. Brown died at one and a half times the rate that whites died. They are less served by the healthcare facilities. We need a special outreach effort. Federal government has provided no funding to do that. But global health officials say it's a problem around the world. We have seen around the world a growing hesitancy about vaccine in general and about a COVID vaccine in particular. At the same time, distrust is growing for other public health interventions. While there is growing anticipation of the vaccine rollouts, health officials caution it will likely be several more months before distribution is ramped up to meet global demand, to truly have a chance to end the pandemic once and for all.

Moderna VS Pfizer Vaccines - Efficacy & Side Effects Comparison (A Scientific Analysis),Strength Of Saad (Holistic Health & Business),2021-09-25,dETQXHGwCdo,"What's up guys, Alexander from Strength of Sard here. We're going to do a scientific analysis of a variety of clinical studies to answer the question, especially from my Australian brothers and sisters who now have access to the Moderna vaccine. If you have access to this, you're asking yourself if you haven't already gotten it, am I going to get Moderna or am I going to get Pfizer? What is the efficacy differences? And then how do we make a decision of what is better for us individually then based on a risk analysis of adverse events from Pfizer compared to Moderna? You see, this is a question I've been trying to answer for myself for some time now and I've done, I just couldn't find any like really recent studies that answered this question. So what I have done is I've as a scientist, I've gone ahead and broken it down, summarized it and we're going to go over it now, but we're going to go over first the efficacy differences because this is a changing landscape now with the most prevalent variant being delta. The efficacy differences or efficacy has changed across these different vaccines. What's more efficacious number one? This question to me is a lot easier to answer, okay? This one based on the multiple clinical studies that we have appears just like TLDR this Moderna appears to be considerably more efficacious over the long term against the delta variant. However, compared to the alpha variant, they stack up pretty similar, but we compare a variant that's not as predominant anymore, it's not as relevant. So let's dig into it a little bit. So we have an August 2021 study, all the titles are there, you can look them up if you would like to vet them yourself, but I've gone there, summarized it. Moderna vaccine was between 81 to 91 percent effective against the delta variant compared to the Pfizer, which is between 69 and 81 percent effective. There's a between because there's a comfort, it's interval, a confidence interval. We are 95 percent sure that the data within this range, we are confident in and is not due to chance. That's good. So both of them obviously effective, but if you're somebody who wants to minimize the risk and take a vaccine, okay? Well, here's a consideration number one on the efficacy in protection against actually getting it. Moderna vaccine showing 81 to 97 percent efficacy and the Pfizer showing 73 to 93 percent efficacy against preventing hospitalization. You see, we have different endpoints here. We have getting a virus endpoint. We have hospitalization endpoint. We have mortality endpoint. We have severity of illness endpoint. We have long term symptom reduction endpoint. We have a lot of different endpoints here, which is why you're going to see us use a lot of different statistics and ranges because it depends on what we're measuring. So now, by July, the total effectiveness, so this is some time after I can't recall the exact day it began. By July, the total effectiveness in preventing infection decreased to 76 percent for the Moderna and 42 percent for Pfizer, indicating a loss of efficacy over time as variants become more common. So over time now, you can expect a waning. We understand this. There is a general waning of antibody response. However, we still have memory T cells and memory B cells to mount a response against a viral pathogen. Okay, that still exists. However, there is a waning. Okay, it is not as effective. And so over time, this is an important consideration. It's like 42 percent, 76 percent, that's a pretty considerable difference that you may want to take into consideration. The authors compared vaccine effectiveness across multiple states over the entire study period. In most states, the Moderna vaccine was around twice as effective in preventing breakthrough infections, breakthrough infections, meaning getting an infection for those who already have a vaccine. This is possible. We say this just because you have a vaccine, does not mean you can't get a virus. I don't understand where this began. Vaccines does not confer vaccines of this vaccine in particular. Does not confer. I think the definition of immunity has been a bit bastardized. Immunity doesn't necessarily define complete protection. It is a reduction, a reduction in risk across multiple different endpoints. Sorry, let's go on. So, okay, cool. Moderna is about twice protective at least compared to this August, let's have a look. That's not the actual study. Compared to this August study. Now, could difference in dose play an important role in effectiveness of mRNA vaccines? Why is this occurring? Several factors contribute to the observed differences in effectiveness of these different vaccines. They're both mRNA. They're both a profusions stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There are slight differences in the formation. If you think about a DNA sequence, the coding, the letter formation is a little bit different. However, it's like they equal the same thing. It's like 1 plus 1 equals 2, but also 0.5 plus 1.5 equals 2. So, it's like we get the similar outcome or same outcome and immunity. We just get there a different way. It's a kind of a really loose analogy to describe some of the differences between Pfizer and Moderna. But most relevant is the dosage. 100 micrograms Moderna versus Pfizer being 30. So, Moderna having around three times the amount. So, of course, can we expect to see higher adverse events? Well, we're going to dig into that a little bit later. But it potentially is a pretty obvious and common sense. Like, oh, that makes sense. Reason why? Assuming similar size constructs, this means that each mRNA dose of the Moderna provides three times more mRNA copies of the spike protein compared to Pfizer, which could result in more effective priming of the immune system. There has not been a head-toed comparison. However, of the neutralizing antibody, titers are listed by the Pfizer versus Moderna. So, again, we have different endpoints of immunity. There's all different B cells, T cells, there's antibody responses, the neutralizing antibodies. I'm not going to go into all the differences right now. But in totality, on average, that is where we are talking about with these difference between 76 and 42 percent over, I believe it was a six-month-ish time period waning. Another study here, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. We didn't see as large differences here in effective against Delta Verance. So, one dose is clearly, so one dose of the BNT, the Pfizer versus the AstraZeneca. And AstraZeneca, you guys can think of that. That's your classic adenovirus vaccine for my Americans who would get the Janssen. The Janssen and Janssen vaccine. Is that a good American accent? I'm man. My Americans. I got love for all of you guys. We're all friends. So, we see that Janssen doesn't give you much protection if you just have one. That's most vaccines anyway. We know Pfizer is like 50 percent if you just get one. But okay, cool. A two doses of the Pfizer was 93 percent protective amongst people with alpha. About 88 percent protective against people who got the Delta. Not as large of a difference compared to the above study, but it waned over time. AstraZeneca, clearly throughout the totality of the last year of vaccines, has consistently shown up to be less efficacious. But you may only be able to get that if you're in a certain cohort. That's what you got to deal with. 74 percent protection is still relatively high. So, take that into consideration if you will. Do with what you will with that. And then alpha variant having 60, well, two doses was 74 percent protective and then 67 percent protective against those with the Delta variant. Okay, cool. Tick. I don't want to sit on these studies too long. I just want to give you a totality of the evidence. I'm a big fan. Are you going to see him? He said a lot. I'm a totality guy. I'm a, I want to see the average. Not one study. I want to see where all these studies are pointing. Are they all modeled up everywhere or are they pointing in a certain direction where we can make a somewhat confident assertion? That would be nice. All right. Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta variants. I'm going to see what one dose is clearly less effective with the Pfizer two doses. 93 percent among persons with the alpha variant and then 85 to 90 percent among people with the Delta variant. Once again, showing another consistent study of similar results. Now, efficacy across hospitalization though. Let's partition out the differences in a really nice table format. Thank you, Dr. Roger Schwelt for making this. I pulled this straight from him. If you want to hear a doctor and some of you asking, are you a doctor? I am not a doctor. I am a scientist with a background in excise physiology, nutrition science and a bit of biochemistry. So, I'm just out here trying to seek the closest thing to the truth and speak to you guys like an actual human being because there's a lot of people who just can't understand them. They're just speaking above you. They're just, they're not relatable. I just want to be able to talk some of you guys and give you, I'm trying to give you the straight. Oh, I'm just trying to teach you, show you guys like, okay, what's, I don't care what the answer is. I just want to know where we're at. And I have an obsession with science and information and education and finding the closest thing to the truth is a very important value to me. And so if that resonates with you, maybe you liked it. If you only want to listen to doctors and epidemiologists and virologists, then I should not listen to me because I am none of those things. Anyway, we will continue. So what we saw, very interesting, but not unsurprising because hospitalization, so we have 18 plus, they got, they're the back up, 32,000 medical encounters, 187 hospitals, 222 emergency room care, 9 USA states. That's kind of the sample size we're doing here from June to August 2021 when Delta was at least 50 percent of the variants they were seeing. What they did is they got all these patients who rep who had COVID like symptoms. Then what they did is they tested them, whether they had COVID or not. Then in the bracket, you can see, all right, I'm vaccinated. 18.9 percent of the people with COVID-19 symptoms tested positive versus fully vaccinated 3.1 percent. So there was an 86 percent reduction in risk of hospitalization for those who were fully vaccinated. 3.1 percent of this cohort versus 18.9 percent totaling a reduction in a reduction in risk of 86 percent. And then we see hospitalizations across different age groups. We see a waning of this with the 75 and older category, but still somewhat efficacious, 76 percent. So reducing hospitalizations is really important outcome. It's not just about mortality, it's not just about morbidity, it's about whether you take up a hospital bed that could otherwise be used for somebody else. And this becomes particularly relevant when ICU beds are at capacity, because then elective surgeries have to be pushed forward, because then people who need cancer surgeries, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, musculoskeletal ailments and injuries that could really improve someone's quality of life, they need to be triaged and then pushed forward according to the level of severity. And so it really, this isn't a point that I've really thought about that much, but that's why what's from reason that that point is important is because while fortunately, you might be in a state where that hasn't had that happening, we've seen it happen before, though, and until it happens in like in front of you to your state or to someone you know, maybe we won't really care, but with a particularly emotive, powerful, enough story or education, perhaps we can illuminate the idea that well, it does, it does matter. Hospitalizations do matter, I have things to do, I don't want to end up in a hospital, I assume people listening don't want to end up in a hospital, so I'm going to do the things to help mitigate me gending up in one, because I'm a busy guy, I like life and life for me does not involve trying to minimize the time in hospital beds as long as possible. That's what I've learned about life. Vaccine type efficacy against getting COVID-19. Once again, now we break it down for the vaccine type, Pfizer, 77 percent against getting COVID, and this was Delta, Delta variant specific, Moderna 92 percent, I like that. That's looking good for Moderna, there's horse race, Moderna is ahead in the efficacy and then Janssen, 65 percent, Janssen came last, got the bronze medal, sorry Janssen, you won't take enough steroids, you need to contact Russia. So, it appears to be Moderna is more efficacious, why? Probably because you get three times the amount of mRNA copies, the dose makes the poison, and the dose makes the benefit, other medicine. And then again, seeing it in hospitalizations, Moderna, once again stacking up to be 95 percent efficacious from compared to people who are unvaccinated, 80 percent for Pfizer, and then 60 percent for the Janssen. And so that covers the first 15 minutes of vaccine efficacy. Now in part two, we are going to go over to that side effects. This is what you came here for, right? Yeah, this is the stuff where I've really been trying to dig in and understand, but I couldn't really get an answer. Adverse events of Moderna versus Pfizer, I know Moderna is more efficacious, so shouldn't I get it? Well, it depends your risk tolerance for side effects, adverse events. Are you willing to take the lower efficacy and protection of Pfizer if Moderna had a measurably increased risk of adverse events? How much would it have to be higher for you to consider Pfizer over Moderna or Moderna over Pfizer? Well, let's talk about it. All right. So guess what, guys? There are adverse events with everything, okay? Everything. And when you have enough of population getting a vaccine, billions of people right now, which is absolutely staggering, mind boggling, you're going to see your rarest of the rare. And that's good for us to know. We want to know that because that's someone's life and no one wants to experience that if they can. And if we can mitigate it, let's do that. And if somehow we're wrong and we have under reported side effects, let's fix that up because maybe there is some under reporting there. Some people think there is a lot of under reporting. That's another conversation for another day, but let's even consider that there is put maybe a 20 percent buffer on all these adverse events and then compare them to the adverse events of COVID and you can make your own mind up. But your mind changes, right? Because new information comes out, better information, perhaps, and we change our mind. That's to be adaptable like Play-Doh. It's Play-Doh adaptable. Play-Doh is very moldable. So enough about Play-Doh. mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID disease. So Pfizer appears to be, TLDR appears to be, you know, have less adverse events. There's a variety of different studies. I'm going to go down to the best one that I found, the best two I found in a second. But severe symptomatic events as of December 2020, so like nearly a year ago, reported in less than 2 percent of Pfizer vaccine recipients after either dose, except the 3.8 percent reporting fatigue, 2 percent reporting headache. So these are these acute effects. So for this study, it was sitting somewhere between 2 to 3 percent. Okay? Yes, you can also have reactions to inactive ingredients. There's Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna vaccines are not formulated with any food, drugs, or latex, but both contain Accipitant PEG for the purpose of stabilizing lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA. The specific PEG in these vaccines is different from the PEG used most commonly in other healthcare products, both in molecular weight and due to its conformulation as a stabilizing proportion of a liposome. AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson vaccines currently have developed and are not contain PEG, but it's then contain polysorbate. So basically, what the hell did I just say? There can be rare reactions that we will see and maybe somebody watching will experience from these rare, these ingredients. Okay? This is why if you have a autoimmune condition, at a tendency to react to vaccines, that is a contraindication for all vaccines. And you can have a different risk profile. You see guys, there's context, there's nuance, there's gray area, they're all the same black and white. Everybody wants to paint a black and white, but there's a lot of gray. I mean, making videos on this since it began in January, in 2020. You can go back on my other channel, I'll examine your soundouts, and you will see you think would come up to just some like consensus, but we just, there's so much out there and it can be overwhelming. So let me quell the overwhelm. Okay? I'll do my best. I'm trying. So we saw this report from Varys, August 2021, they looked at Gillian Bar syndrome from the Janssen administration per million doses. And yeah, like you can look at the data and you see like per million GBS is pretty low, right? It's higher in males. That's pretty low, it's fine. Okay, it's like, eh, it's a real people experiencing it. It's not to be dismissed, but it's nothing like, you're gonna really probably gonna freak out about. All right, but let's keep going. We look at Pfizer, we look at thrombotic events, Vaxe and porn. And again, I understand from the limitations of the VAIR system, we're just trying to aggregate the data a little bit here and just see roughly where the data could be pointing, just to get like a general understanding of what's going on from which is a raw statistical standpoint. That's not awesome statistics to be honest with the VAIR system, but let's get some idea. Yeah, so basically they aggregate the data and they try to estimate how many outcomes of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations and ICU admissions could have been prevented, hence those numbers here. But instead, you know, I'm not gonna, well, I'm not gonna put too much stock in that. I'm gonna spend a probably bit more time in the clinical studies, but just to give you guys an idea of like, okay, like, that's a lot of people, like 13 million doses, they looked at on the VAIR system and they saw, you know, like a total 7.8 GBS per million. Okay, cool, but it is an adenovirus, the the the the the Jansen or the AstraZeneca, so not everybody's gonna take that. Let's get to the real money, the real money right here. Okay, so the majority of adverse events from adenovirus Pfizer were mildly moderate in severity, grade three severe events, greater than or equal to 2 percent in frequency after the first dose included injection site pain, 2.7 percent after the second dose fatigue, myalgia, 8.9 percent after all job, we took in like muscle pain, headache, pain, arrhythmia, redness injection site, like this is all the acute like low grade stuff that we're not that concerned about, it's gonna pass pretty quickly for most people, okay, but now let's get to the money. This is the first study that really highlighted to me how actually the majority of people getting the Moderna vaccine by the second dose experienced some type of adverse event. I almost like, man, I rather that it didn't happen because the Moderna was looking really efficacious, but the data is better than my feelings, data beats feelings, okay, data can be corrupted, data can be misinterpreted, data can be incorrect, of course, but generally on average, this seems to be where the data is pointing, so let's understand a grade one, grade two, grade three adverse events, grade one is mild, generally not bothersome, grade two bothersome may interfere with doing some activities, but not particularly dangerous, grade three, serious, can interfere with persons ability to do basic, basic motor control things like walk, eat, grade four, severe enough to require hospitalization, grade five, well, I should just write dead because you're dead, grade five is fatal, it's the worst, so we looked at three grades, I don't know why they didn't look at grade four on five, maybe they didn't exist, maybe they did and they didn't record it, I don't know, however, the red is the worst, it's grade three, what's the worst here, you don't want grade three, because then you're not be able to do your day to day task very well, so placebo, placebo dose two, placebo is crazy, because look at all these people still get reacting to a placebo dose, they know seabode themselves with a placebo dose, then we see the one, two, seven, three means Madonna, it's not a name for it, Madonna dose one, any adverse event we looked at about 80 percent are experiencing any adverse event and a bit higher, small like 77 percent versus around 80, 82 percent for the second dose, and then we break it down into different categories, you could pause the video and look at what we see is local events, like acutely at like a particular site, swelling, lymph, swelling of your lymph nodes, arrhythmia, pain, but then we come over to the systemic events, which more annoying, more serious, fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, chills, and so what we see is that, you know, let's look at some of the most significant ones here, and majority of people here from getting the Madonna are experiencing some sort of adverse event, but it's a scale, right, and it does resolve generally within three to five days, if you're lucky enough in the 20 percent to not get any, awesome, okay, however, like let's put into consideration that, ah, these are some of the things you may experience, they all have their own unique relative risk differences, some of the highest ones are headache across the second dose, fatigue, myalgia, chills, and then pain in the local events, pain could be injection site pain, okay, it's not specific to, yeah, injection site pain, it's not specific to like a different area to my understanding, so this is within seven days, by the way, recorded, so that is what we're potentially approximately dealing with, with the Madonna vaccine, okay, now and then they come over here, and they, we just, nice little summary, PDF here, 30,000 participants, 18 years and older, this was the normal 28 days apart from vaccine, 100-mile microgam dose, dah dah dah, all some of the standard stuff, most reactions with mild to moderate and resolved over one to three days, so great, you can expect yourself to resolve this, side of time and flammatory response within one to three days, cool, that's nice, but let's still be aware that there are some adverse events that can, you know, have a bit more of a diluterious effect that you'd rather not experience, so injection site adverse events after first dose, it's like 84 percent, that's fine, little bit of pain around this, whatever, right, however systemic adverse events after second dose, it's like 80 percent, you know, that systemic one was what we're talking about here, and so that could be anything, fever was relatively rare, particularly, I mean, our first dose doesn't seem to be any, almost any, what seemed to be the most prevalent was that headache fatigue, my algebra, type of events, so plan ahead for that, don't know, see, yourself, just you might be the 20 percent, the 30 percent, like that could be you, but somebody, why not you? anecdotally, what I'm starting to notice is potentially more of the unhealthy cohort with people with unhealthy lifestyle risk factors appear to be, this is not a study, by the way, this is my observation, my anecdotal experience, people who are generally unhealthy, sleep deprived, nutrient deficiencies, overweight, obese, poor immune system function, generally seem to be responding a little bit poorer on average, and a high risk for adverse events, I believe that, that would make a lot of mechanistic sense to me, I don't have clinical evidence to back it up though, so in summary, the severity of the solicited systemic events increased after the second dose of the mRNA, I'm a donor vaccine, with increased proportion of grade two events, from 16.5 percent after the first dose, to 38 percent after the second dose, grade three events though, this is where I can, you can get knocked out for a couple of days, you're not really doing much, you're kind of bedridden, we went from 2.9 percent from first dose to 15 or 16 percent after the second dose, solicited systemic adverse events in the mRNA group, lasted on average 2.6 days and 3.1 days after the first or second doses, so you can take this information and then you can go compare that to many of the other videos I've made on the, and many other much smarter people than me have made on COVID-related adverse events and long haul symptoms, and you can compare the two, and you can say which one would I rather, because the reality of this situation is in my estimated opinion, majority of people across the world will get COVID at some point within the next 5 to 10 years, that appears very clear to me, I won't dig into the nuances of why, but let's assume that that's approximately true, or then you really have two options, you're either going to have the antibodies from a vaccine, giving you some protection, or you're going to rely simply on a night immunity, again it is of my opinion that each individual should choose what to put in their body, it's your body, and I think we should govern individually what we put into it, however we should base these decisions based on informed consent, solid education, scientific rigor, and logical rational, unemotive type of critical thinking, and I will do my best to continue to do that, now I still try to look at a head-to-head comparison, because this doesn't compare to Pfizer, you kind of have to, it's not in a head-to-head comparison, which is bothersome to me, because I can't make direct comparisons here, fairly reliably from this to scrolling up to the Pfizer, because it's comparing different outcomes, so you're like, okay, it appears like Moderna does have some increased adverse events, but how much? Well, I can't see any other studies, if anybody else has them, please send it to me, I'm sure new ones will come out after this video is made, February 2021, you see this one was February 2021, that's the earliest I'm seeing these adverse event studies had to head comparison, I don't know why they haven't been more, anyway, what we're seeing is, I don't know why this says 50 milligrams, this is a nice little comparison of the characteristics of Moderna versus Pfizer, okay, efficacy different, okay, we need to also acknowledge mechanism action pretty similar, we also need to acknowledge a transportation of this is quite difficult, both need to be stored at very cold temperatures, the Pfizer at much colder temperatures, requiring specialized refrigeration units, and this now is, I know this is not the purpose of the video, but just let's put some compassion empathy, let's say those in low-sociative economic areas all across the world, like impoverished, poverty, third world communities, well, guess what, some of them may not, a lot of them would have the technology to transport these effectively, they'll have to use other viral vectors in order to confer immunity to their population, and so I guess it is a privilege to be able to live in a society or a country or a state if you do, to be able to have access to options, the fact that I can we can even consider this versus this, I want to at least illuminate that, I guess that's something to be grateful for, I think, you know, options are good, flexibility is good, do you want the big Mac or do you want the cheeseburger, or do you want to go down to the supermarket with whole food store and get yourself a fresh locally caught something something something, right? We got options here in this society, which is nice, so just some considerations, I guess for other people who don't have as many, so let's make the best decision with what we have access to, in my opinion, so here we have adverse events, what we what we're seeing, you know, beltspawsy, as occurred with Madonna, after second dose vaccine, clinical symptoms were moderate to severe, facial swelling, and on the left we see, you know, the classic pain swelling, redness fever, chills, lymph swelling, arrhythmia, and then we see with the adenovirus, you know, we see a bit more myocodatas, heart inflammation, and so each viral vector has its own, symptomology, okay, related to it, but let's get down to what we really, this is what I really came for, okay, this is a head-to-head comparison of the frequency of adverse events between Pfizer and Madonna, what we see in the orange, Madonna, it's very clear, you can be a baby and look at this and be like, what's bigger, orange or blue, orange, well done, here's a lollipop, Madonna clearly stacks up to be to have a higher adverse event, frequency, boom, compared to Pfizer, check, got it, now, if you just say that statement, you might freak out, risk is relative, so we need to then apply a relative risk across the x-axis, we see a percentage of effect, and we say, lymph swelling, 20 percent, it's t-apparently, this is a relatively, it's not uncommon amongst general vaccines to see lymphs swell, vomiting, nausea, it's a terrible feeling, they put these together, they put these two together unfortunately, but vomiting and nausea, like nausea proceeds, usually comes before vomiting, so we see about 23 percent, where Pfizer, you see very rarely do we say vomiting and nausea as a result of the Pfizer vaccine, but Madonna we're seeing it considerably higher, so if you're like, I hate vomiting more than anything in this world, then maybe, maybe you get the Pfizer, okay, I hate vomiting, but not almost better than anything in this world, man, how's it being so thought-vomited? She's been a long time, right? If you can get away with like 10 years without vomiting, I think that has a big win, like you have avoided food poisoning, water contamination, you're doing a pretty good job, it's pretty gnarly feeling, we need to have the acid be ejected out of your stomach with bile and chime into, I hope this description is really nice for some people, probably clicking off the video around now, anyway, that's what vomiting is guys, don't know if you've heard of it, anyway, arrhythmia side injection pain, whatever, I think that's a whatever, if you're really stressing about injection side pain, maybe, the virus isn't your biggest problem, swelling, similar, fever, very similar, joint pain, eh, a little bit more, 20 percent more, yeah, that's important, people exercise, they can feel a little bit more pain potentially when they're exercising, they may immediately rate their ability to exercise, chills, no one must feel chills, they can keep you up at night, 45 percent versus 30 percent, muscle pain, 61 percent, so yeah, muscle, like the muscular, how should I say, the muscular system appears to be a little more affected here, and the skeletal system, headaches slightly more fatigue, pretty similar, and pain injection side, pretty similar, so really we're just looking at the nausea, the vomiting, the joint pain, the chills, the muscle pain, and the headache being higher relative risk, they're excited from three different CDC links that you can see below, and this makes sense considering the dosage is three times, so now we've finally gotten to the question after all this time, what do you do? Well, I can't tell you what to do, I've got clients asking me what do I do, I'm not gonna tell you, it's not up to, I don't think it's fair for anybody to say what you should do, I think the individual should come to an informed decision themselves, we need to practice critical thinking, and I want to practice critical thinking, you don't just give people fish, you tell them how to fish, you show them how to fish, you show them how to think, you show them how to ask questions, you show them how to be skeptical, but not so skeptical that you're cynical, but not so optimistic that you're naive, you know, you do your best to try and swing back and forth and argue for yourself and against yourself and that, hey, maybe there's a lot of adverse events that aren't being reported, I got health professionals and colleagues that I trust and love, and you know, get along with, and some of them are like, you know, this could be a reality, so I want to also acknowledge that side, I just, it's very hard for me to tell how much is being misappropriated, but let's just, I think if you just apply maybe a blanket, you know, the data might be like 20 percent off on like everything, you know, if you have like a buffer for like 20 percent, like maybe, maybe adverse events are not, maybe these adverse, I mean, if you apply 20 percent here to be 100 percent, that doesn't make sense, relative to what it is, 20 percent of 80 for example, like if you just give yourself a little bit of a buffer, it's an arbitrary number, it really doesn't matter, if you give yourself a little bit of a buffer of like, ah, this could be a bit off here, um, and then you compare it to the alternative, which is virus, that vaccine, virus, with vaccine, you just make, make up, you make your own decision based on the information you have access to, and the mind you have, and ability to think, so look, this is the best, the conclusion after, you know, a lot of time digging through, ah, PubMed and different, um, scientists and professionals to try and find, ah, more information on the relative risk differences, on adverse events between the Moderna and the Pfizer, and the efficacy differences, this is what we come to now, in summary, the Moderna does appear to confer a higher relative amount of adverse events, most of them appear to resolve within three to five days, the Pfizer appears to present less, considerably less adverse events, and for those who are not concerned about lower efficacy, may choose to opt for Pfizer, those who do care more about overall protection and efficacy, and are not as concerned with the adverse events, may choose to pick Moderna, I'm just kind of giving a thought experiment now, I'm like, you know, if this, then that, if this, then that, and so it all depends on your tolerance and risk for acute and systemic, but seemingly short term adverse events, and how much you want to be overall protected from the virus, the PubMed. I hope you guys found that this valuable, I'm Alexander, strength the sard, all links below if you want to see more, thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time."
"Denmark Study: Pfizer Efficacy -76%, Moderna -39% After 3 Months Against Omicron",Tony Lin II,2021-12-31,tJoKLQbAgEI,"Hi, this is Tony Lin, welcome to my video. A couple days ago, I presented you the study from the United Kingdom, the famous school, Imperial College London, that shows you that Pfizer's advocacy against Omicron after 14 days is negative 18 percent. Today, I'm going to show you another study from Denmark. Their result is even worse than the United Kingdom's data. So, in this Denmark study, they found the Pfizer's advocacy against the Omicron after three months is minus 76 percent. 76.5 percent and they also found the Moderna vaccines after three months against Omicron is minus 39.3 percent. I wonder how these two completely different countries get the same result for the vaccines advocacy against Omicron. So, in case you don't know why the advocacy is minus, that means that the people who are fully vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna, their change of getting Omicron COVID is higher than the unvaccinated people. So, without further ado, let me share you this study from Denmark. So, first of all, I want to let you know that this study from Denmark is posted on this website and met our xiv.org. This website posted a lot of preprinted studies about health sciences. I'll include the link for you so you can read this entire study yourself and this is indeed from the legit source. Now, let me show you this study from Denmark. So, title says, vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection with Omicron or data variant following two doses or booster, BNT, which is a Pfizer, and RNA-1273 is Moderna vaccination series, Danish cohort study. So, under the others, you can see a lot of PhDs with their names. So, this study is indeed from the expert, the leading health expert. So, if any of our Singaporean people think they are smarter than these PhDs and they can find a mistake from these PhDs study, leave comments below. Because, obviously, you are smarter than these PhDs and hopefully, I can get the permission to interview you instead of interview these PhDs. Of course, I'll go ahead to read these study yourself and I'm just going to show you the result. So, from this table, let me show you this table. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for BNT 162B2 Pfizer and the mRNA-1273 Moderna against the infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and the data variant during the November 20 to December 12, 2021 Denmark. So, the left collar is standing for the Pfizer, the right collar is for the Moderna. Here, I want to show you the value after 91 days. So, here you can see the after 91 days, which is about three months. So, the vaccine efficacy for the Pfizer is minus, here is number minus 76.5. And for the Moderna, it's minus 39.3 percent. So, again, I'm laughing, but I'm not kidding. If you go ahead to check my link, you can see the study yourself. And actually, the data from this study is consistent with the previous update from the Pfizer. Let me show you the Pfizer's update. So, this is a Pfizer website. And I also include a link so you can read this update yourself. So, Pfizer, there is a Pfizer, they have an update to the Omicron variant. Here is the update. The companies are continuing to advance the development of a variant specific vaccine for Omicron and expect to have it available by March in the event. That an adaption is needed for further increased level of duration of protection. So, the study from the United Kingdom and Denmark, their studies are resolved. It's actually consistent with the Pfizer's their own update because most likely the Pfizer also found their vaccines are efficacy against Omicron. So, the next Omicron is very low. So, that is why they start to spend the money to develop the variant specific vaccine for Omicron. And it is expected to be available by March. So, the rest are short. Next year, you will have the vaccine for different variants. For example, you will have a vaccine for the Delta variant. You will have a vaccine for the Omicron variant. And you will also have a booster for the Omicron variant. And you will also have a booster for the Delta variant. And I believe the vaccine for the vaccine for this is very good news because keep injecting these vaccines for different variants over and over and keep getting these booster over and over. And assume you will immune to any diseases in this world. Again, if you think my video is informative, please hit the like button and share this video with more people. Especially the vaccine worship person. Because this is obviously a good news. They will start to get more and more vaccines. And that is I think they are really enjoyed to do. Subscribe to my channel so you can always get the latest updates on COVID-19 and the vaccine. Have an amazing day. And remember to keep your vaccine advocacy against virus positive, not negative. Otherwise, otherwise, you end up getting these diseases more easily than the Omicron variant. Have an amazing day. I'll see you soon in my next video. Bye!"

"Myocarditis, COVID and Covid Vaccines - Pfizer & Moderna Vaccines",Doctor Mike Hansen,2021-06-25,yd5tV-SoCeo,"Myocarditis is heart inflammation or to be more specific, it's inflammation of the heart muscle. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium or the outer lining of the heart. Myocarditis and pericarditis often occur together, hence the term myoparicarditis. How often is it caused by COVID? How often is it caused by the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna? And what are the symptoms of heart inflammation? How is it diagnosed? I'm going to unpack all of this in this video. And if you're new here, I'm Dr. Mike Hansen. Welcome to my channel where I love to break down medical topics and provide you with real medical explanations. This is my dog legend. He likes balls. Myocarditis is an interesting diagnosis because it can present in a variety of ways, not just in terms of various signs and symptoms, but a variety of non-specific labs in the blood work, non-specific EKG findings, non-specific echocardiogram findings, meaning ultrasound of the heart. Also, most people with this diagnosis have zero or mild symptoms. Now on the flip side, it can rarely present with sudden cardiac arrest. And even if you are able to make the diagnosis, it's usually even trickier to determine the cause. There are lots of different things that can cause myocarditis. Heck, even heavy metal can cause it. You might also notice there that smallpox vaccine can cause it. Well, I should say could cause it, because routine vaccination of the American public against smallpox stopped in 1972 after the disease was eradicated. But the most common cause of myocarditis is the result of the immune system reacting to a viral infection. Common viral triggers include adenovirus, coxacu virus, influenza, parbovirus, B19, and herpes. And of course, you can add COVID to that list as well as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. But before we get into the details of cases of myocarditis after the vaccine, let's go to baseline understanding of the seriousness of myocarditis. Disease severity can range from unnoticeable to mild symptoms to severe illness requiring ICU to death. More often than not, it's a mild, temporary issue. In more serious cases, when there's more heart inflammation, the heart has a harder time pumping blood, which can lead to heart failure. The highest risk population for myocarditis is from puberty to the age of the 30s. So it affects males more often than females. There are no specific symptoms that are associated with myocarditis, but the common symptoms include chest pain or chest pressure, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the hands and feet, heart palpitations, light head inis, and a sudden loss of consciousness. In the early stages of viral myocarditis, patients will usually initially have fever in muscle aches. Now, if there's parricarditis to go along with that myocarditis, the most common symptoms going to be chest pain. And that's usually a sharp or a stabbing pain, but some have a dull, achy or a pressure-like chest pain. A diagnostic clue with parricarditis is that the chest pain is worse when lying flat and better when sitting up. Making the diagnosis of myocarditis depends on signs and symptoms, lab tests, including troponin levels and BNP, certain EKG findings, and echocardiogram findings. Usually, a chest x-ray will be normal, but can sometimes show in a large chart. Coronary angiography, meaning a heart calf or heart catheterization, is sometimes necessary to rule out coronary artery disease as a potential diagnosis. Cardiac MRI is indicated in patients with suspected myocarditis with elevated chuponent levels, or if they have ventricular dysfunction, especially if they don't have a clear cause, such as ischemic heart disease, meaning coronary artery disease. Some might ultimately require a biopsy of their heart called an endomirecardiobopsy, but that's usually reserved for those who are very ill. Even though COVID is a respiratory virus, it can affect the heart in several ways. First, when COVID causes pneumonia, it can damage the lungs, decreasing the amount of oxygen that gets to the heart, and making it harder for it to pump blood to the body. This is known as demand ischemia. Second, the inflammatory response from the immune system to fight that virus, it's sometimes excessive. The cytokines storm that you hear about, it's a cascade of cytokines and chemokines of the immune system, and that can ultimately damage organs in the body. Basically, it's collateral damage, so the damage from this inflammatory response is known to especially affect the kidneys, brain, and the heart, and that's when you have myocarditis. And as if that's not bad enough, inflammation can cause small blood clots or micro thrombi to form in different blood vessels throughout the body, including in the capillaries of the heart. More than 4,000 children have suffered from multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children, so MIS-C, which can cause inflammation of the heart, the lungs, the kidneys, and the brain, as well as other organs. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can also affect the heart muscle cells themselves. A study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, it showed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus invades the heart muscle cells and interferes with contraction. Researchers there used stem cells to model the contracting heart muscle tissue. Their research showed that the viral infection actually destroys the muscle cells and you're left with a heart that doesn't pump blood. On a related note, when we talk about COVID long haulers, one of the common symptoms that I see from patients in my pulmonary clinic is that they have this chronic, central chest pain or chest pressure, especially when taking in a deep breath. My suspicion is that there might be a small degree of persistent myoparycarditis going on there, but that's hard to know one way or another. As of June 10th, about 4 million children have contracted COVID. This number represents 14 percent of all cases in about 5,300 cases per 100,000 children. About 17,000 children have been hospitalized and 330 have died. COVID has been in the top 10 causes of pediatric death since the pandemic began. Now, as a comparison, 188 children died of influenza in the 2019-2020 season. The CDC has also reported that as of June 9th, 2600 plus people under the age of 30 have died of COVID. There have been cases in very small studies looking at patients who developed myocarditis after getting the COVID vaccine. The CDC has received 1200 plus preliminary reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following about 300 million total doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. These preliminary reports came through the vaccine adverse event reporting system that's maintained by the CDC and the FDA. Among people 12 and older, there are 267 reports of heart inflammation after one dose of the vaccine, 827 after the second dose, and then 132 after an unknown dose. The CDC continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for every 12 years of age and older. Why? That's because for every million second dose vaccinations with either the Moderna or the Pfizer, there have been tens of myocarditis cases, but thousands of COVID-19 cases that are prevented. For males aged 12 to 17, it's estimated that for every one million second dose vaccinations, there are 5,700 COVID cases, 215 hospitalizations, 71 ICU admissions, and two deaths that are prevented, with an estimated 56 to 69 myocarditis cases. For females in that same group, age 12 to 17, it's estimated that for every one million doses to complete a two dose series of that vaccine, you get 8,500 COVID cases, 183 hospitalizations, 38 ICU admissions, and one death that would be prevented compared to 8 to 10 cases of myocarditis. And then when you look at the bracket of aged 18 to 24, those numbers look even better. Since Wednesday, there's been a joint statement from the leaders of more than a dozen health agencies and organizations, including the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Association, and more. And they're all saying that the COVID vaccines are safe and effective, and that they strongly encourage every one 12 and older to be vaccinated against COVID-19. This is their conclusion, quote, the conclusion is that myocarditis is an extremely rare sight effect, and only an exceedingly small number of people will experience it after vaccination. Importantly, for the young people who do, most cases are mild and individuals recover often on their own or with minimal treatment. In addition, we know that myocarditis and pericarditis are much more common if you get COVID-19, and the risks to the heart from COVID-19 infection can be more severe. We recommend getting vaccinated right away if you haven't yet. It's the best way to protect yourself, your loved ones, your community, and to return to a more normal lifestyle safely and quickly.

7. What are the long term side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?,NHS England,2021-04-19,ADrL0D6ifV4,"What are the long term side effects? Like all medicines, some people might have mild side effects after the COVID-19 vaccine, but for most people, these don't last very long. For example, your arm may be sore where you had your injection, which is expected and completely normal. Some people may feel sick, tired or achy or get a headache. Long term side effects from vaccines are very rare. What we do know is that the long term side effects of COVID-19 can be deadly. Having the vaccine can help to protect you, your family and your community from this virus. For the facts on the hashtag COVIDVacCine, visit www.nhs.uk-corona-virus. www.nhs.gov.au"
"EU looks into Pfizer, Moderna vaccine side effects",Reuters,2021-08-12,arpFrCME3o0,"Shares in Moderna and Pfizer sank on Wednesday after the European Union drug regulator said it was looking into possible new side effects of the company's COVID-19 vaccines. That includes kidney inflammation and allergic skin reaction and a renal disorder with heavy protein loss in urine. Pfizer is by far the biggest supplier of COVID-19 vaccines to the European Union, issuing just over 330 million doses in the region compared to some 43 million from Moderna. Both companies did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. The European Medicines Agency has not recommended any changes to the vaccine labels. It says the latest assessment is part of routine updates to the safety section of the authorized vaccine's database. It's also looking into menstrual disorders as a possible side-effective vaccines including those from AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson. Last month the EMA found a possible link between very rare heart inflammation and Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines which use mRNA technology. However, the European regulator and the World Health Organization have stressed that benefits from these vaccines outweigh any risks. The watchdog did not give details on Wednesday on how many cases of the new side effects were recorded but said it's requested more data from both companies."
Why Pfizer And Moderna Can't Be Sued For Covid Vaccine Side Effects,CNBC,2020-12-22,nJbd402xj0Q,"You're looking at video of Sandra Lindsay, an intensive care nurse receiving the first vaccination at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York. The U.S. began vaccinating the population against the coronavirus in December of 2020. The goal is to get the COVID vaccine to every person in the U.S. who wants one, but surveyed data shows that nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population doesn't want it. White spread mistrust might have something to do with the fact that if anything goes wrong with the vaccine, the drug makers that produce them aren't responsible. This is a remarkable circumstance. It's certainly not like anything anybody's ever seen before. That means the companies like Pfizer and Moderna have total immunity against lawsuits related to injuries resulting from taking the COVID vaccines. Meanwhile, employers are legally allowed to require employees to get immunized against the virus. Requiring a vaccine is a help that safety work will and it plus can do that. Ultimately, if we want any chance and returning to life is normal, mass vaccination is going to be critical. So how do you convince the public to take a vaccine made in record time using technology that's never before been licensed? And is anyone to blame if something goes wrong? McRodders Pfizer and Moderna built their COVID vaccines with a new kind of technology that's never before been licensed in the U.S. Typically, a vaccine puts a weakened or inactivated virus into our bodies to trigger an immune response. But the coronavirus vaccine relies on messenger RNA, which contains a piece of genetic code with instructions for our body. The mRNA tells ourselves to make a protein, the same protein that's the spike on top of the actual coronavirus. This is what triggers the immune response to COVID-19, which then produces antibodies. Those antibodies are what ultimately protect us from getting infected if we ever encounter the real thing. Both companies have said that taking their vaccines could result in side effects similar to mild COVID symptoms, like muscle pain, chills, and headache. Even though side effects of the vaccine resemble COVID-19 symptoms, it's impossible to contract the coronavirus from the vaccine because the mRNA vaccines that Pfizer and Moderna are making don't use the live virus. I experienced stiffness pain in my left arm, where I had gotten the vaccine, but it was mild. The second dose was a different story for betalvie. After the injection, I had the same side effects as the first. So the localized pain, stiffness, it was a little bit worse. More significant symptoms presented that evening. I had developed a low grade fever and stuff associated with that. So the fatigue had worsened. I had gotten chills. Other trial participants from both the Pfizer and Moderna studies have reported similar issues after the second shot. One Pfizer trial participant told CNBC that after the booster shot, he woke up with chills, shaking so hard he cracked a tooth. For him, it hurt to even just lay in his bedsheet. But this kind of reaction isn't the norm. Both of these vaccines are about 95 percent effective, but it's still unclear how long this protection lasts. Is what worries some doctors more than the potential for any sort of long-term side effects? There is a concern that once the immune response against the vaccine wanes, that we might see more disease, and that is why all the face-to-reclinical trials against COVID continue to run even with, after demonstrating the early efficacy. One major benefit of the mRNA technology is how quickly it can be developed. And that is one of the reasons why the messenger RNA technology was sort of first in line right after knowing the virus' genetic sequence. But the COVID vaccine's faster manufacturing timeline is part of what has been feeling widespread fear that it's unsafe to get the shot. Experts, however, say the process was no less rigorous than usual. A lot of the steps that would occur in sequence in the past has been occurring in parallel during COVID, but they were not eliminated in terms of determining the safety of the vaccine. The FDA may have cleared the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, but mass adoption, it's not guaranteed. Roughly four in 10 Americans say they would definitely or probably not get a vaccine. While this is lower than it was two months ago, to achieve herd immunity, experts say that about 70 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated or have natural antibodies. Central to closing this trust gap is a robust and reliable national education campaign. The Department of Health and Human Services is slated to spend $250 million in taxpayer money on this effort, but this pushed by the federal government to educate the public has been plagued by controversy. For everything from allegedly trying to politicize the message, to concern over the lengthy delay and rolling out the targeted messaging that was promised. At least 15 states told NBC News in early December, they weren't waiting for the HHS campaign. Instead, they launched their own communication campaigns to expedite the message. The private sector is also playing a big role. As everyone's responsibility, what we do know is that pharmacy and pharmacists are actually in everyone's community. We have pharmacists are within five miles, probably 90 percent of Americans, really pharmacists are up there is one of the most trusted healthcare professionals. And the survey recently said that three or four Americans basically said they trust pharmacists to administer their COVID-19 vaccine. Closing the COVID vaccine trust gap will prove especially difficult in communities of color, which have been hit hardest by the pandemic. Black Americans, for example, are dying from COVID-19. Almost three times the rate of white Americans in the US. That's part of why federal health officials have talked about giving priority access to the vaccine to people of color. But there is an overwhelming resistance to inoculation. A survey released at the end of November 2020 found that only 14 percent of black Americans, mostly or completely trust a COVID vaccine will be safe. In 18 percent trust it will be effective in shielding them from the coronavirus. We've had continued mistrust because of people who have been frankly abused within the healthcare system, not treated respectfully, not approached in a costly, competent manner, denied access to care. Experts say the memory of the Tuskegee, Sipilis experiment has also fueled suspicion. For 40 years starting in 1932, the US Public Health Service used black men to conduct a study of the progression of the lethal Sipilis disease. And because of racism, overt racism, and even microinsults that have occurred to people of color in the health system, people developed a degree of mistrust. Combating this narrative may take a more targeted approach. The National Medical Association of which Benjamin is a member is convening a group of black doctors for an expert task force that will independently assess the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. We know that patients trust their doctors. And many of the surveys have shown that if their physician recommends it, they will be much more likely to take the vaccine. If you suffer severe side effects after getting the COVID vaccine, there's basically no one to blame in a US court of law. Take the vaccine makers. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar invoked the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act in February of 2020, which protects the makers of COVID products such as vaccines and treatments from legal action. This protection lasts until 2024. Essentially, in order to encourage companies to get into the space to develop vaccines for the good of the public for the public health, the government comes up with a program which immunizes those companies from liability for any injuries or damages caused by taking the vaccine. That means for the next four years, companies like Pfizer and Moderna can't be sued for money damages in court over injuries related to the administration or use of products to treat or protect against COVID-19. But drug makers like Pfizer continued to reassure the public no shortcuts were taken. Pfizer and Moderna did not return CNBC's request for comment on their legal protections. But remember, it was the FDA that actually cleared the vaccine for use. So does the federal government bear any responsibility? You can sue the FDA for proving or disapproving a drug. That's part of its sovereignty. Sovereign immunity traces back to British law before the American Revolution. You couldn't sue the king. The US adopted that same principle. Their limited exceptions, but legal experts say they don't provide a viable legal path to hold the government responsible for a COVID vaccine injury. And the workplace now introduces a unique set of legal challenges related to the vaccine. Once the FDA upgrades its emergency authorization to a full approval in a few months from now, their speculation that employers could require staff to get inoculated. The clients of mine that are most interested in making a mandatory vaccine, a condition of employment, are brick and mortar operations that have a lot of foot traffic from their customers. They view it as a selling point. Look, you can come to our business location and it's safe because all employees have been vaccinated. That's particularly important for restaurants, bars, gyms, and salons. While this is in part a PR tactic, it is also legally within an employer's rights to roll out this kind of requirement. Requiring a vaccine is a health and safety work rule, and it can do that. Now some employees could apply to be exempt from a blanket requirement. If a workforce is unionized, the collective bargaining agreement may require negotiating with the union before mandating a vaccine. Anti-discrimination laws also provide some protections. But legal experts say that if an employee is forced to get a vaccine and suffers a debilitating injury from it, claims would be routed through workers' compensation programs and treated as an on-the-job injury. So if you're looking for accountability, you're probably going to have to use other accountability tools beside the court. If you're looking for compensation, you should use a government compensation program. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, better known by the name Vaccine Court, is relatively easy to use and generous in terms of what it's willing to pay out to those who are eligible. But because the COVID vaccine has not yet been recommended for routine administration to pregnant women or children, it doesn't qualify. Another program, and the only real pull-of-cash available to those harmed by the COVID vaccine, is a fund attached to the prep act. The so-called countermeasures injury compensation program has been around for a decade. But experts specializing in vaccine law say it's a lot more difficult to navigate. The problem with the prep act is that it's attached to a government compensation program that's very hard to use, where the bar for compensation is very high. Since the program began 10 years ago, the CICP has only compensated 29 claims, totally more than $6 million. If a case for compensation through the CICP is successful, however, the program provides up to $50,000 per year for unreinverse loss wages and any out-of-pocket medical expenses. It won't cover legal fees, nor anything to compensate for pain and or suffering. It's also capped at the death benefit of $370,376, which is the most that a surviving family member receives, and the event that a COVID vaccine proves to be fatal. There's also a strict one-year statute, meaning that all claims have to be filed within 12 months of getting the vaccine. People who are hungry by a COVID-19 vaccine deserve to be compensated fast and generously. The prep act doesn't do that. The HRSA declined CNBC's request for an interview. Rice says the best fix is to change the rulebook of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. An easy solution is to say anyone hungry by a COVID-19 vaccine is compensated under that program, but that will require a legislation change. With that legislative change happening, lawyers tell CNBC that there usually is a retroactive provision once a new vaccine is added to the VICP. That would be good news for those injured by the COVID vaccine, who would then have access to a much larger pool of cash that has a better track record for rewarding compensation. But for now, it remains to be seen whether Congress will actually make the change, meaning that compensation options are limited. I'm hoping people don't look at this and say, heck, I'm limited in what I can recover in the event of a serious injury or in the event of any injury. So I'm not going to take it. It's not overreaching by the government whatsoever. It's the government doing what it should be doing, which is protecting the public health general."
COVID-19 Vaccine | Neurological Complication,NeuroscIQ,2020-09-26,olRgaoi-N90,"Hey everybody, welcome back to NeurosyQ, the best place on YouTube for you to increase your neuroscience IQ. Thanks for joining us for another week's video, and for those of you who are new to the channel, make sure you subscribe and turn on notifications so that you can be made aware of our weekly neuroscience videos. In today's video, we are going to be talking about a case of transverse myelitis that occurred in a patient after she received the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine that is undergoing trials right now. So today we are going to be talking about what transverse myelitis is. We're going to get into the particulars of this case. We are going to be talking about whether there have been other cases of transverse myelitis from other vaccines, and we are also going to be discussing what this could mean for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. So sit tight, stay tuned, let's roll the intro. All right, let's get straight into it. First off, we're going to be talking about what transverse myelitis is. So we are neuroscience channel. So as you might expect, transverse myelitis is some sort of neurological disorder. According to John Hopkins, it is the swelling of the spinal cord that leads to weakness in the arms and legs, numbness or tingling, pain and discomfort, bladder dysfunction, and bowel motility problems. So if we have inflammation in the spinal cord, we have swelling around it that can impact nerve function, which is why we would expect these symptoms such as the weakness in the arms and legs, the tingling, and then loss of control of your bowel movements and your bladder control. Now, 60 percent of cases are because of unknown inflammatory presences. And so these unknown cases are also referred to as idiopathic cases. We don't know what causes them, and the reason is because the causal mechanism tends to be some sort of viral infection that causes inflammation, and so this mechanism disappears quite quickly. So just like an infection, our body fights it off, our body fights off the inflammation, and it's been hard for doctors and scientists to figure out what exactly is happening, but we do know that there is inflammation happening in the spinal cord. Now, 40 percent of these cases are because of autoimmune disorders. And so the autoimmune disorders are long lasting. These would be things like multiple sclerosis or lupus. And so those mechanisms are easier to understand because they don't go away, and we can continue to look at the processes. Now, with TM or Transverse Myelitis, what is happening is there's some sort of immune mediated process that causes neural injury to the spinal cord. So we've talked about in other videos the immune response, and we've talked about the cytokine storm that happens with COVID-19. But basically, we want to touch on the immune system for a quick second. If you have a foreign invader in your body, the immune system attacks that invader and fights it off, and some of the things that happen are inflammation and swelling because of the immune response. If we have swelling around the spinal cord that will cause the symptoms we've talked about with an autoimmune disorder, what happens is the immune system is attacking proteins in the body. So instead of attacking a foreign invader, the immune system has a hard time figuring out what is actually part of the body and what is a foreign invader, and it ends up attacking its own self, which can cause problems. Something that we have been able to observe in transverse myelitis is elevated white blood cell count in the cerebral spinal fluid. So white blood cells are what we typically think of as our immune cells that they fight off the foreign invaders. And so if we have a high white blood cell count, typically it is because you're fighting off an infection. There's also the presence of blood brain barrier breakdown with transverse myelitis in certain areas of the spinal cord. And we also see inflammatory markers like interlute in six. All in all it's a pretty rare disorder and there's only about five cases per million people each year. So let's get into talking about what happened in our case. So in this case, there was an article in CNN. Basically, an otherwise healthy 37 year old woman was hospitalized with transverse myelitis two weeks after her second dose of this COVID-19 vaccine that is under trial by a company called AstraZeneca. So she showed inflammation in her spinal cord. She had trouble walking. She had weakness and pain in her arms and the neurologist said she has been recovering and she began to improve in just four days. Now, when this happened, AstraZeneca paused their trial, but they resumed on Sunday September 20th. So about a week ago, they did file a sussure, which is a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction report. And so this means that it was a red flag for the vaccine. The whole fact that a billion dollar drug company, positive trial, means that this is something adverse enough to halt the science and to halt the trials before going for FDA approval. Now, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who we're all familiar with now during this pandemic, said that he thinks it's a one off and it would be unusual to stop treatment just because of one case. While it's true that it's hard to tell if a one time occurrence would happen again, we've seen this happen in other vaccines. So Oxford filed a report saying in the current trial, we have undertaken safety reviews when volunteers in the trials of the COVID vaccine developed unexplained neurological symptoms, including changed sensation or limb weakness and have paused the study while a safety review took place. After independent review, these illnesses were either considered unlikely to be associated with the vaccine or there was insufficient evidence to say for certain that the illnesses were or were not related to the vaccine. In each of these cases, after considering the information, the independent reviewers recommended that vaccinations should continue. Close monitoring of the affected individuals and other participants will be continued. So basically, they said it's a one-time occurrence and we couldn't say that it was because of the vaccine or not. Now, the vaccine, their testing was developed from the common cold virus that chimpanzees get. They genetically altered this virus so that it is impossible to infect humans, but they added genes that make the COVID-19 proteins so that the body can build immunity against it. So basically, what happens is they took this virus from chimpanzees, they altered it to make sure it can infect humans, and then they altered it to give it COVID-19 proteins so that your body starts to build antibodies against those proteins and then if you were to get COVID-19, you'd be immune. Now, that means this vaccine is going to trigger an immune response and that's what all vaccines do, which could be why inflammation is happening and why this patient had transverse myelitis. However, the researchers said that they couldn't be sure that it was caused because of the vaccine. Now, we have to think critically about the evidence we have and while we can't be sure it's important to take everything into account and examine this situation from all points of view. Now, the trials were started in April 2020 and they began with 500 people. This is the second stage. They're now testing 5,000 people. Now, vaccines have become a million dollar business and that brings us to our question about what is AstraZeneca? So AstraZeneca is actually a multi-billion dollar multinational research-based bio pharmaceutical company. They were leading the race to finding the COVID-19 vaccine, or recently with the halt to their phase 3 testing, their stock actually fell. And so this is bad for business because this is all a company they're trying to make money and then we have some sort of mishap in the testing. Nobody wants bumps in the road when they're trying to do anything. And so with that came loss of millions of dollars. So this could be why companies try to conceal things and also with the race to find a vaccine and all these multi-billion dollar companies leading the race, the problem comes to people not wanting to share ideas. With science collaboration is very important and so these companies might be invested for the wrong reason and nobody's going to want to share their ideas when they could keep them to themselves and get a billion dollars if they just keep trying on their own. Right? Anyway, this could be why there are issues with transparency and that could be part of the reason why AstraZeneca wasn't fully transparent with the issues at the beginning. The question about whether or not there has been similar cases. I did mention it a little bit earlier. The fact is other vaccines have been shown to lead to transverse myelitis. So even though AstraZeneca said that it can't be stated for sure that transverse myelitis is being caused by the vaccine, we have to be cognizant of these other factors. Now, there's a review paper that looks at all the instances from 1970 to 2009 of transverse myelitis. What they did was they conducted a search using the keywords transverse myelitis, myelitis, vaccines, post vaccination, vaccination, and auto-immunity and they revealed 37 reported cases of transverse myelitis that occurred because of different vaccinations. Things like hepatitis B, MMR, or mumps, measles, and rebella, and the tetanus shot. Now, the range of time between the shot and these symptoms usually was about several days or a couple weeks where in the case with the AstraZeneca patient, it happened about two weeks later and in some cases it's even longer about three months later. Now, because it's happening in all these different vaccines, some scientists suggest that maybe it's one of the boosters in the vaccination. So, vaccinations should come with boosters. Some of them, they'll have like part of the vaccine is generic for most vaccinations and they're saying maybe this is what's causing the transverse myelitis, but it can also just be the immune response of the body that's causing inflammation. There was also a study that looked at 47 patients that came in with transverse myelitis, particularly children, and out of the 47 children, most of them had just received a vaccination within one month. Now, we have to be aware that these post-vaccine neurological complications are rare, but they are well described and it's something we have to be careful of. You don't want to be giving the population a vaccine that they think's going to help them and have these side effects that we could avoid if we take time to develop a better one. So, we've had cases of things like Julien Barre syndrome, which is another neurological disorder, things like peripheral neuropathy, cranial nerve palsy, and cephalopathy, which we've actually talked about in another COVID-19 video. We've seen cases of encephalopathy caused by COVID-19, so again, the immune response causing the sense of cephalopathy could be caused by a virus or by the vaccine for the virus as well. And we've also seen cases of our topic today, transverse myelitis. Just like with encephalitis, there have been cases of transverse myelitis happening in COVID-19 patients as an adverse reaction to the virus. So, it is very well possible that the immune response could be instigating this neurological disorder. Nonetheless, if possible, it would be best if we could find a way to make a vaccine that does not lead to these effects. Now, most of these neurological disorders occur because of immune response, so they're mostly immune mediated. And some vaccines are more associated to transverse myelitis than others. For instance, HPV is the most commonly associated with transverse myelitis. It is about 41 out of 850,000 people that come out of the vaccination with transverse myelitis. The polio vaccine also shows a high amount of transverse myelitis cases, about one in 125 to one in 800 vaccinations result in this adverse effect. We've seen the transverse myelitis with the H1N1 vaccination. Overall, there's a rate of about 3.7 cases per year of transverse myelitis with vaccinations. Now, the rate of transverse myelitis occurring in the normal population is also around the same amount. Now, people say correlation is not causation, but the timeliness is a big factor in this situation. With transverse myelitis, we've seen that 47 percent of the cases came after the B vaccination and 20.16 percent of cases occurred after the HPV vaccination. Out of these cases, 38.7 percent had permanent disability afterwards. So not everyone's as lucky as the patient in the AstraZeneca case where she is recovering. Some people end up with permanent disability, which is why we have to consider what could be happening. So what are the actual possible mechanisms for transverse myelitis occurring upon vaccination? Now, we talked about the fine line between recognition of self and non-self proteins. So what could be happening is molecular mimicry. Basically, if the vaccine has something in it that might resemble self proteins, and then we're creating an antibody for those self proteins, we can instigate swallowing an inflammation in the body while the immune system attacks the spinal cord, and that can lead to transverse myelitis. Another possibility is epitope spreading. So basically, what this means is that because the antigens are accelerating an already present autoimmune response, we can have further inflammation. So if the individual already has an autoimmune disorder and an autoimmune response that they don't know about, injecting them with a vaccine could accelerate this process and lead to the transverse myelitis. We can also have polycolonal activation of B lymphocytes, which is bystander activation. So we're activating the immune system, enhancing cytokine production, and leading to the cytokine storm that causes inflammation in the body. We've talked about this in other videos as well. So the take home message is that we have to consider all these factors and we have to be very careful when developing a vaccine. I would say that at this time, scientists need to collaborate now more than ever to help come up with a vaccination that we can get to the public. But most of the time, collaboration helps facilitate better ideas and helps facilitate and accelerate coming up with an end product. So I think it's important that we're sharing all these factors when developing a vaccine and that vaccination companies are being transparent with what's happening in their studies so that the public can trust them when the vaccine is ready.

Here’s what we know about COVID-19’s impact on the brain,Science Magazine,2022-04-15,7RjItCm_YpU,"We did anticipate that there will be neurological complications right from the very beginning. I've been studying viruses since the 80s when the AIDS pandemic started and it was the same story they are too. A lot of people have long term cognitive problems even if their viruses are well under control. What affects the brain can be extremely devastating because it can affect your personality, your ability to think and concentrate, your mood. And those things that make us a person as a whole. When SARS-CoV-2 emerged, many were initially focused on its impact to the lungs. It soon became apparent that COVID takes a toll on the entire body from the gastro-impestinal track to the brain. Autopsies have revealed devastating damage in the brains of those who have died from COVID. Blood vessels were damaged, there were inflammatory cells around the brain. We found that there were immune cells in the brain itself. And we found antibodies stuck to the blood vessels, where we knew that they were attacking the blood vessels. I had expected that we would see a lot of viruses in the brain because the virus affects the nose. To our surprise, we didn't find the virus in the brain. There are few people that have reported detection of viruses in the brain, but they find very, very small amounts. It doesn't explain the pathology that we see. Most of these autopsies were conducted on individuals who had severe cases of COVID. Less is known about brain damage in those with long COVID. Symptoms that persist for weeks after what is often a mild stage of acute infection. Studies estimate that up to 30 percent of people develop long COVID after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. And that women are at greater risk than men. The symptoms can include fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and various neurological issues. We've actually seen over time, now that we've seen hundreds of patients and lots of people have been reported in literature too. There are these kind of major categories. One of them is this what people call brain fog, where really your brain is just not functioning properly for some sort of cognitive types of tasks. Things like concentration, memory. People have skin changes, where they basically say, wow, the sensation on the surface of my skin is really abnormal. And then another major category that we've seen is headache. There is the sort of psychiatric categories where people have rarely had a much more acute and profound delusion or psychosis syndrome. I think it's been a real challenge for patients that they come into the doctor with symptoms and the tests that are run are negative. And even things like MRI, which is a very sensitive test that can find lots of changes in the brain for many of these patients is normal. For a long time, we've been using research tools that can look at more sensitive measures that aren't things that we necessarily use in the clinic, but can tell us things like what are the immune system is functioning completely normally, or what are there might be very subtle injury to the neurons in the brain that you just can't see by looking at MRI skin. There are three hypotheses that can potentially explain how a lung COVID can affect the brain. One is a direct infection of the virus, of some cells in the nervous system or supportive structures in the brain. Second hypothesis is that there is autoimmune responses that are attacking parts of the brain. That could obviously trigger lots of different symptoms and long duration of such responses because once the autoimmune cells are activated, it's very hard to deactivate them. The third possibility is that there is distal inflammation happening such as in the lung that could stimulate cells within the brain and trigger long-term changes in those cells. So a combination of these could be happening or it could be a sequential event of things that happens and they all contribute to this brain neurologic issues. Long COVID clinics across the world are trying different rehabilitation approaches to improve these symptoms. Our nervous system has a whole portion of it that is dedicated to what doing all of the things that your body needs to autonomously control when that gets knocked out of balance. That's called dysonmomia. Disonmomia has also been reported in other cases of post viral illness. Bautonomic rehabilitation is a very personalized and a very delicate approach to rehabilitating the autonomic nervous system or most people that we see with lung COVID. It typically begins with very, very gentle movements paired with breath work with a patient laying flat on their back, slowly performing movements that increase blood flow into the chest cavity. It's not exercise, it's not aerobic, it's very gentle. We've had good response to cognitive symptoms from autonomic rehabilitation. I think it's worth mentioning that not all cognitive symptoms are from dysonmomia. And so in some cases we don't move the cognitive symptoms at all. Researchers are also beginning to conceive of drug treatments that may address the underlying causes of long COVID. A team at the National Institutes of Health is awaiting regulatory approval for an immune modulating drug trial. The plan is to bring in patients, we're going to keep them in the hospital for a week. And we want our own will get placebo. The other arm will get intravenous immunoglobulin. And the third arm will get intravenous corticosteroids. They are sledgehammer approaches. They're not very precise attacks, right? They affect the immune system in many different ways. Vaccination in long COVID patients have impact on their symptoms. Some people feel much better from vaccination. That could eliminate the source of these persistent virus or by remnants or something that's basically persisting in these patients. That's triggering the chronic inflammation. Number two, some people don't feel any difference at all. But there are some people who feel worse from vaccination. If a person is suffering from autoimmune disease, for example, the vaccine induced inflammation might exacerbate the auto reactive lymphocytes and therefore making the disease temporarily worse. And the ultimate goal is to try to understand what we can do to help them feel better without using the vaccine. Because vaccine doesn't work on everybody. But if we can figure out what triggers the better improvement of their symptoms, then we can try to emulate that with other therapies. Many hope that the knowledge gained from long COVID research will benefit others grappling with post viral illnesses. We have millions of people suffering from not only this but very similar related diseases, post-limes syndrome, Gulf War syndrome, MECF. Patients that are going from physician to physician, nobody knows what's wrong with them. People tell them, well, it's all psychological or anything. But they have real disease. Now we have a superb opportunity to put the best tools that we have available to us, try and sort this out. If we could do that, I think you have a huge impact in the field."
Moderna COVID-19 vaccine causes painful side effects in patients who have facial fillers | ABC7,ABC7,2020-12-24,tYJkhp8lGho,"and an unusual side effect to the Moderna COVID vaccine, but you only have to worry about it if you've had certain cosmetic procedures. The FDA Advisory Committee reviewing the new Moderna vaccine has noted a specific side effect involving several trial participants who've had cosmetic facial fillers. Local board certified dermatologist Dr. Shirley Chi explains what the FDA committee noted. In these cases, the patients all had swelling and inflammation of the area that was given the filler. A couple of the patients had cheek filler done six months prior to their vaccine and one patient had lip filler done two days after her vaccine. All of the patients were treated with steroids and antihistamines and all of the reactions resolved. Millions of people have physician-administered cosmetic facial fillers to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles and to enhance cheeks and lips. Dr. Chi says the reaction to the vaccine is immunological. Your immune system, which causes inflammation, is revved up when you get a vaccine. That's how it's supposed to work. So it makes sense that you would see an immune response in certain areas where they see some substance that is not a naturally occurring substance in your body. Dr. Chi says don't let this keep you from getting the vaccine when your turn comes up. She says all of the derma filler reactions were easily treated by medical personnel. All of them resolved successfully. Hello, I'm Mark Brown. Get more great ABC7 content by clicking the subscribe button for our YouTube channel.

FDA warns about Moderna COVID-19 vaccine side effects,WCNC,2020-12-29,JTRA2GcVkAU,"616 on your Tuesday morning. Thanks for starting it with us here on Wake Up Charlotte. Time now to connect the dots. When we make the news make sense, the Moderna vaccine rolling out at our hospitals and nursing homes. It's been proven safe and effective for nearly everyone. But there are some side effects to be aware of if you've had any sort of like cosmetic procedures. We have to be with warning about an unusual side effect of the Moderna vaccine for patients who have facial fillers. Let's connect the dots. What facial fillers help soothe out wrinkles or create the illusion of say something like larger lips. And FDA advisory boards as people who have them reported swelling and inflammation after receiving the Moderna vaccine. We don't know how bad their reactions were, but we know that they're okay now. The patients were treated with steroids and antihistamines and soon recovered. So why are you smelling? Doctors say when you get a vaccine it reds up your immune system. Since fillers are technically a foreign object in your body, your red-dupped immune system may see them as a threat and then attack causing a kind of allergic reaction. Still, doctors are encouraging people who have facial fillers to get the vaccine anyway because the reactions were easily treated with common medications. And that's connecting the dots."
My Moderna Vaccine Side Effects: A history of anaphylaxis and my personal response to the vaccine.,ESP Sports Medicine - Life and Sports Clinic,2021-02-01,KKWQyupgKsQ,"COVID has changed the way we live, the way we work, and how we communicate. I've had to find peace and realize nothing lasts forever. I found a new passion and reconnected with my world in my own backyard. And in this time, I found myself right where I wanted to be. I started new projects, learning, building, and growing, using my body and my brain. I met new friends in all types of places. And I used my brain by doing nothing at home. I spent more time at home appreciating what really matters. I found myself supportive by an amazing group of people who worked under difficult circumstances. I kept my sense of humor as the world changed. Three babies were born to women who worked for us the past calendar year. And the world got weirder and weirder. I lost my little buddy, my friend. And as the year passed, I became fatigued, waiting for normal times to return. And then we got word we had access to the vaccine. I got the first dose, the second dose was coming, little over three weeks later, and I was thankful. There I am returning to work after the second dose. I felt fine, little nauseous, had any and much for breakfast after working out fairly hard. So we went on with our day. We had a video project plan. You know, I can't be out long for work. Too many people rely on me and the risk was great enough that I went ahead and got the vaccine. Not really a flu shot guy. I have a pretty severe history of seafood allergy. And I didn't really think about it much. I felt responsible to make sure I'm available to work. But I had no idea how I was going to feel later that day. Oh my god, my headache is crushing me. I got fever, chills, body ache. I'm sweating, even though I'm cold. But my head is pounding. I got kicked out of bed. Go to the guest room. Try to get some sleep. I have a full day of work today. I can't miss work. But I feel like crap. I'm crossing and turning. My whole body is just achy, cold, even though I'm hot and sweating. Can't find comfort. So I get up and I feel better getting up and moving around. If I have some caffeine, maybe I can get through the day. Got my tea, little pisser. If I keep my sense of humor, that should be all right. I can deal with a headache. As long as I don't look too sick, I'm not sick. I'm just beat up. But my arm, my shoulders just crushed sores. It's OK getting it up, but no way you can bring it down. Much more soreness than the first vaccine. See if I can stretch it out. There's some weight. Maybe if I lift some heavy weight, it'll feel better. And go. No, I'm kidding. If my shoulder doesn't feel better, this is what I'm going to have to do to get through the day. That's a good plan. But let's get some food in me. More tea. I'm definitely feeling better being up and moving around, laying down and actually gave me more of a headache. Feeling good, Art? Nice. I think I can do this. I clean up well. Got a little bit of a fever. The headache is the biggest problem. This is halfway through the day. My head's killing me. I have waves of fatigue and body ache, but otherwise, I feel good. It's just, I don't look great. Update on my arm. Pretty much the same, not really helping me much. But I'm making it work. End of the day, you look a little better. Eric, how do you feel? You feel any better? Do you regret getting the vaccine? But you're happy. It's done. Good. You'll better. Sleep well. Next day, let's see how I do. Did I survive? I feel good. Yes. Man, if that lasted longer, that would have stunk, but I feel strong, so I'm gonna move around. Gonna see how I feel. I'm always interested whether it's sickness or exercise or travel, elevation change. I'm always interested how the body responds. And usually what I find, I'm pretty mobile for a guy, but my hips get tight. My mid back gets tight. But my shoulders feel pretty good. They're a little sore, but nothing like the day before. And my mid back rotation, feel good. But the next day, we start losing people quick, because they had the second dose. The day after me, no camera. We'll miss her. I hope she feels better. She's struggling with the same symptoms I had. Dana, the heart and soul, nicest person in the world. She's down. We'll have to get through the day without her. We love her, we miss her. Okay, Eric, do you think it's wise to expect symptoms after the vaccine? Okay. Kim's gonna hold down the fort for us. And actually, Dana comes in to work in the afternoon. I did not prompt this, but she looks like I did the day before. Eric, Eric, Eric, come here. What do you have to say any important information about the vaccine? Oh. Well, good luck, everyone. Whatever you decide, we wish you the best."
'COVID Arm' Pfizer And Moderna Vaccine Side Effects,CBS Pittsburgh,2021-04-16,-Vcm7bUocSg,"We know Johnson and Johnson's vaccine has dominated headlines this week. It's on the shelf because of possible blood clots in several people. It's still being investigated, as we know, but we know that there are six clots cases in the U.S. out of close to 7 million who have gotten that vaccine. But we also know that there are some other side effects from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that are much more common. John Shemwe has more on those this morning. And you know, you hear from people who have gotten the shots and they're telling you, oh, hey, make sure to hydrate, look out for this. This is what I experienced. So it's really dominating conversations. Yeah, and it really pops your eyes if you see somebody with COVID arm. And that's what we're talking about primarily two of these reactions. One being COVID arm, the other being swelling in the lymph nodes. So for a little bit of perspective on these that can affect up to 15 to 20 percent of the people who get the shots. I went to Dr. David Agas from the USC Tech School of Medicine, the CVS Medical Expert. What COVID arm is is it's a reaction. Your immune system attacking the spike protein that the vaccines make. And as part of that, it's manifest by some redness on the arm. It can classically be delayed, you know, by several days up to a week or so. And then it can last for devil days, but it goes away in every patient. And it is part of the normal reaction. It is seen much more often in the Moderna vaccine than the Pfizer vaccine, but it's seen in both. And again, it's transient. It is, you know, to me, it's kind of a visual manifestation. That vaccine is working. So myself as a geek, I think it's amazing to see this because, you know, I know the immune system is hard at work for protection, but obviously it can be scary for individuals. And there are the lumps known as inflamed lymph nodes that so many people are finding. That can be a little intimidating. No question about it is that, you know, when the vaccine is there, your immune cells travel by a highway called the lymphatics. And then they get together in big parking garage is called lymph nodes. And so when they're reacting to something, they're going to get enlarged those lymph nodes. And so while it is scary, it is normal and it will go away. And this is part of human physiology. Yeah. And he says, don't be surprised if that swelling in the lymph nodes sticks with you for a while. It could be a week, maybe, but a couple of weeks after that, you might want to consult your doctor about it. All right. So where should we be looking for in particular? These all of our lymph nodes are, is it one particular area? No, it is in one particular area. Generally speaking, we're talking about the underarm, the armpit area on the side where you got the vaccine. And because it is so close to the breast, there is a kind of an alert out there for women who are scheduled to have a mammogram. Okay. If you're going ahead with the mammogram, make sure you tell your doctor. You've had the vaccine to where it was because it could show up as a false negative on or false positive on the mammogram. Or if you can delay the mammogram, that's another good idea according to Dr. Aikus. All right. Some good information. Thank you so much, John. Sure."
"Comparing Pfizer, Moderna COVID-19 vaccines head-to-head",WCVB Channel 5 Boston,2023-08-08,5lZcC6JWKMI,"5 on your health tonight, comparing COVID-19 vaccines head to head is one brand better than the other for certain patients. Here are some answers. Dr. Shira Daron, the chief infectious disease control officer should say for tough medicine health system. Good to see you. You too. All right, Dr. Daron. As you well know, the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna both use the same mRNA technology. But what are we now learning about the differences between those two brands, especially in older adults? Well, it's pretty interesting. So this new study looked at Medicare data from over six million older Americans after receiving their first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. And they were searching for the occurrence of 12 serious side effects over the course of four weeks after vaccination. Now less than one percent of the pet participants had any serious event after vaccination. And for most of the types of events, they looked at there was no difference between the two. But for a few of the outcomes, most notably pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lung, the risk was lower after Moderna. But pulmonary embolism is a complication of COVID-19. And Moderna was found to be more effective at preventing COVID-19. So what we might very well be seeing here, what's hard to tell is not that the Pfizer group had more side effects from the vaccine, but that they had more instances of COVID-19 and its complications. You know, we heard many times during the pandemic, the best COVID vaccine to get is the one that's available, right? So knowing what we know now, should anyone have any regret, feel some kind of way, about the brand of vaccine they received? You know, I wouldn't use a temporary grant. And I'm not worried that this study means that the Pfizer vaccine is dangerous at all. And certainly, any side effects from vaccine are limited to a few weeks after vaccination. So you don't need to worry about something you got last fall. Limited supplies of vaccine in those early days and a lack of data meant that the best advice was to get vaccinated as quickly as possible with what was available. Now luckily, we no longer have to worry about vaccine supply. So this study was done to inform future discussions between people and their doctors so they can choose the brand that might work best for them. All right, it's now approaching mid-August here, Dr. Jerome. When are we going to find out about what they're going to recommend for this fall? And do you think it's going to be limited to just the higher risk folks this time around? Well, I think the CDC will recommend an updated shot this fall at least for higher risk people. And that's what was just announced in the UK. You know, this study abounds what I've been recommending, which is Moderna might be a little bit better for older people due to its slightly increased effectiveness. And I recommend Pfizer for younger males due to its lower risk of heart inflammation. Okay, Dr. Jerome, thank you as always for joining us. Thank you."
Covid Vaccine side effects made life difficult for over 6 months and still there......,EthanFromLondon,2021-12-17,bPDm-RV0Xks,"Hi guys, welcome back to the channel. I know I made a funny video about my coronavirus vaccine reaction. But unfortunately, I got a real reaction and I thought I should make a quick video in case other people are having this and they're wondering what's going on. I had the AstraZeneca vaccine 10 months ago when it first came out and it was announced and then I was alright. So after the second dose I got a bad headache that started off just above my left eye in this region and it carried on, got worse and worse over three, four days, so much so that I had to call my doctor and make an appointment to say, I need to see someone because I have this really severe bad headache and it's not going away. Then I saw them and they couldn't figure out, did some tests and things and everything seemed normal and then the headache kind of moved and went into the eye socket, like the inside of my eye started to hurt. And gradually the headache went away but it turned into this really awful burning sensation that was happening to the right side of my face. It was kind of a feeling when you get severely sunburned and your skin is just constantly burning. It was that kind of feeling where I felt like somehow my skin was damaged and it was just burning all the time. I was having trouble sleeping and then I went to see a few more doctors and they did some checks and tests and they couldn't figure out. Eventually they suspected it might be related to the COVID vaccine but they couldn't be sure because they weren't enough other cases or people with similar symptoms. But then I read online somewhere that the vaccine damages the myelin sheath. So if you think of a cable, that's the easiest example I can give you. The metal bits are inside these rubber tubes to keep them away from each other and also, so if someone touches it from the outside they don't get electrocuted. Similarly, the nerves inside our body, they have the nerve itself and it's covered by a myelin sheath. So the electricity that's flowing inside the nerve doesn't, isn't impacted by the touch or transmission across. There is a nerve called a trageminal nerve that comes out from behind or rather above the ear and it goes into this direction on the side of the face from both sides. And I believe along with the several doctors I spoke to and we had extensive discussions about this that perhaps the vaccine damaged the myelin sheath of my nerve and now the nerve was irritated somehow in sending the messages to my brain saying there was something burning but it wasn't. Anyhow, they put me on anti-epileptic medication which basically is designed to reduce the firing of the nervous system down to a very low amount because epilepsy is created by extensive firing of the nerves. So I was on that for about six months. I had to take one tablet at night every day and as soon as I took it it would make me feel very drowsy and I would sleep and it would make me feel really relaxed and flaccid. So even when we're asleep and we're resting, our body has what's called a basal tone where the muscles still have a little bit of strength or tension in them. But after that medication my muscles were so relaxed at night that I started to snore. I never snore normally unless I'm really drunk and it was like I would wake up in the middle of the night because I could hear myself snoring and it was because my mouth would open everything was just so relaxed. It also made me extremely hungry all the time. I was sleeping, eating a lot and gaining weight. So I gained a lot of weight and I made another video about that but as a result of this weight in the whole sleeping issues I decided to come off it so I spoke to the doctor and asked them to help me taper it down and I can come off it so I stopped taking the medication. And now I still have those flashes of pain or burning sensation that comes. So once or twice a day I will get this like a spark that's like burning here and then I'll touch it and there's nothing there and then I'll get like a spark of something burning here or here. It just comes and goes so I think there's still something wrong with the nerve that was damaged and it's slowly healing and the parts that are not fully healed they sometimes send that wild message. And when I went for my third booster they told me they're not giving me AstraZeneca and they gave me Moderna because they said it's better to have a different brand for the third one because it kind of mixes it up and improves your immunity. So there's a website if you don't know that's been created to report any issues you may have or side effects so then they can collate that information and fix those issues or address those issues in the future vaccines. So if you're experiencing any of those I would highly encourage you to go and look at that and report I did as well. But yeah I thought I should share with you something serious that happened because the last one the video I made I'll link it up here but that was a complete joke and kind of cry wolf came and got me. So thanks for watching and until the next one."
Side Effects Of Moderna's COVID-19 Booster Shot Explained,Health Digest,2021-12-07,jgqiP3gNfVs,"Wondering what you need to know before getting a Moderna COVID-19 booster shot? Want to know what side effects you should watch out for and why it's important to get the booster? Keep watching. Moderna's COVID-19 booster shot contains half the dose of the shot used in the primary series. Although the dose is smaller, the side effects seem to be similar to those seen after the second Moderna dose. Based on data taken by Moderna, the most common side effects of the booster shot include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain. Chills, nausea, and vomiting have also been reported. Symptoms seem to be worse in recipients ages 18 to 64 and not as severe for those over the age of 65. However, data from Israel's booster shot program indicates that symptoms are less severe overall after getting the booster shot than they were during the initial shots. Fewer side effects have been reported for both the Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, and experts expect the same data to follow with the Moderna booster shot. Moderna's COVID-19 booster shot side effects may be less severe because the dose is smaller, but it may also be because people are more prepared for the experience. According to Robert Weber, administrator for pharmacy services at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, people who are getting the booster shot know what to expect and how to prepare this time around. He told the AARP, 'I think people also understand how to manage the side effects better in terms of drinking plenty of water prior to getting a vaccine, drinking plenty of water after you get the vaccine, taking it easy the next day.' Being less nervous about receiving the COVID-19 booster may also prevent symptoms like anxiety, which can make other symptoms feel worse or more concerning. AARP also noted that health officials have said it is okay to get a booster shot from a different brand. If your symptoms were particularly uncomfortable from Moderna's first two doses, for example, you may be able to get a Pfizer booster shot instead. Although experiencing side effects from a vaccine can be nerve-wracking, mild to moderate symptoms are very common. According to the CDC, your body creates an immune response to the vaccine that will protect you in the future. If the disease you are being vaccinated against ever enters your body, your immune system will be prepared to fight it. Mild side effects, including injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain, are all extremely common. You shouldn't worry if you experience those effects after receiving Moderna's COVID-19 booster shot. Some people are concerned about long-term side effects, but experts say these are rare. According to Women's Health, most side effects occur within a few days or weeks of receiving a vaccine or booster. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said, 'Thinking of all the vaccines we use in childhood and adulthood, I can't think of any long-term side effects. Vaccines don't have a bad effect that occurs eight months, a year or two, or longer.' All vaccines and boosters, including the ones developed for COVID-19, go through a rigorous testing process through the FDA before they are authorized for public use. 'Two things people should know are that the booster is still safe and if you got the full dose without the booster, you still have incredible protection against hospitalization and/or death.' Of course, regardless of how effective a vaccine is, its efficacy can wear off over time. This has been the case with the COVID-19 vaccines, as well as many other vaccines in our history. The prevalence of new COVID-19 variants also affects the initial vaccine's efficacy. The antibodies we create after our first doses may not be as effective at fighting these variants, and a booster shot can make sure we are better protected. So far, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been highly effective against the various COVID-19 variants that have emerged. If you are eligible for a booster shot, getting one can significantly reduce your risk of developing COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study on October 29 that shows that vaccination against COVID-19 offers better protection against the virus than a previous infection. If you have already been vaccinated, a COVID-19 booster shot can increase your level of protection. Check out one of our newest videos right here!

Moderna side effects second shot,The Kam Kast,2021-03-08,9R74EIear2A,"So right now I'm about to go and get my second COVID shot. It's a Moderna branded shot. Moderna makes a shot. And then a lot of my choreographers said they had, you know, experiences like fever, they had body aches. And yeah, I'm a little nervous by it, but I don't think it's going to be such a big deal. So what I'll do now is we're going to document how it is getting this shot, you know, and I can't bring the camera inside with me. But what I'll do is I'll document what I can. And then I'll I'll tell you how I feel. So maybe some of you are concerned. Hopefully, hopefully, I don't feel bad. But you know, this is what this is for. That's what this vlog is for. So I will next time you see me, it'll be after I take in the shot and then we'll document it like 15 minutes later and hour later, so forth. So wish me luck. Let's go. So 40 minutes in, no headaches, no nausea, no sore stomach, nothing. Just going to eat lunch now and be all right. So it's been almost an hour since I got the last shot of my series for COVID, the Moderna shot as you see in earlier. And what do I have? Symptom wise, like I have like a light headache, but I'm not sure if the light headache is from this elderly lady who had this insane amount of perfume that was just everywhere. Hey, side note, like elderly people and others, I guess. Why do you wear so much colon and perfume? Like do you have to spray it on so heavy that you know, three blocks away, you have to get everybody with it. But you know what it is, I think it's because I have a sensitive sense of smell anyway. But it is what, and I almost an hour later, 50 minutes later, light headache. I'm not sure if it's from some old lady's perfume that was everywhere or because of the shot. So I don't know, we'll figure it out. Stay tuned. I'll report back if I have more symptoms. But if this is like the majority of it, then great, great. Feel better. Exactly. And I'm going to have later, how do I feel? I still have a headache. It's kind of light. It's not, you know, it's not so pounding where I'm being destroyed by it. Like on a one to ten, one, one and a half. And now I feel a little fatigued. I feel a little tired. It's not, I want to fall asleep. But like I feel worn down. I don't know if it's just because it's you know, later in the afternoon, but I mean it's only been an hour and a half and normally I don't feel this way. I feel a little tired. I feel a rundown. But nothing major. So that's the hour and a half report. Yeah. No, man, I think I think it'll be okay. Like they said, even in like the symptoms and they give you the paper. Oh, when they give you that paper, they say you might experience headache. You might experience a little tiredness. And I think those are the experiences that I'm having right now. Same standard experiences that I think everyone else would probably get. But it's not gonna stop my day. I got more stuff to do. So yeah, I want to have a later. It should be fine. So it has now been 24 hours later and yeah, no symptoms, no side effects. Back to things great. So that was a follow up Moderna shot, first shot, light headache, second shot, and a headache for like six, seven hours. It was a really light headache, a little tired, often on. And then that's it. No other symptoms, support. All right. So I wanted to give an update on that second shot and then you know, so the first 24 hours, I was great. First 24 hours, no problems, nothing to speak of. And I felt I think, oh, this is great because there were some of my friends who had symptoms and I'm like, maybe I'm gonna get away with it. But right at like the 30 or so hour mark, I was like, I don't feel good. And I laid down and I just stayed there. I was a thargic. I had chills. I had light body aches. If we're thinking about like the flu symptoms, maybe it was a two out of 10 on the on the flu symptoms scale. That's just a scale I made up. But yeah, two out of 10. I didn't want to do anything. I wanted to just stay down. I wanted to just lie down and not do a damn thing. And I stayed that way. I stayed that way the entire night. But when I woke up the next morning, I was fine. I was fine. I was like, yeah, I don't feel anything. I feel normal. I feel regular. So I was talking with a few of the friends that they said, oh, they felt kind of bad on their first shot. They felt okay on the second shot. Some of my friends got really sick on the second shot. But I'm pretty fortunate. So if you're wondering where you should get when you should get this, if you should get this vaccine, then the answer is yeah, just go get it. Because you're gonna get protected from all these other deeper symptoms if you do get COVID, right? You'll still get a little ill if you get COVID. But not as bad as saying like, I need to go to the hospital. So yeah, that is my second dose update. If you have a chance to get it, get it. If your parents are thinking about getting it and they're concerned about the symptoms, tell them they'll be fine. They'll be fine. If you're concerned, you'll be fine. You'll you might feel like crap for a couple of hours, maybe up to eight hours and then you'll be fine after that. Okay? So yeah, rough time, man, 2021. Everyone should get that vaccine. See you."
Pfizer is 'deeply sorry',Dr. John Campbell,2024-04-11,rnVTj2Uy9yc,"Well, a warm welcome to this talk. Thursday 11th April. I once went to a shop to buy something and I got the impression that the shopkeeper was being less than honest with me. It's almost as if he was trying to get my money under false pretenses. So you know what, I didn't go back to that shop again. Now on a set put matter, we're going to be looking today at this report from where are we here. Now this is about a complaint made about Pfizer and I'll be looking at this in some detail now and it's good to see that this is being picked up by some aspects of UK mainstream media. But let's get straight into the detail so we don't misquote anyone. Pfizer bringing discredit on the pharmaceutical industry as the headline. Now the panel and we'll talk about the panel in a minute ruled a breach of the following clauses of the 2019 code. So Pfizer apparently has breached these codes. I mean who would have thought it? Breach of clause two bringing discredit upon and reduce confidence in the pharmaceutical industry. Breach of clause 3.1 promoting an unlicensed medicine. Well, imagine that promoting an unlicensed medicine. This is Pfizer we're talking about. You would have thought they would be squeaky clean wouldn't you. But there you go. That's what this report has said. So that one gets a tick as well. Breach of clause 7 too making a misleading claim. Well deary deary me making a misleading claim. Yep, you know they found that made a misleading claim. Making claims that did not reflect the available evidence regarding possible adverse reactions. Well, I mean it seems that adverse reactions could have been downplayed according to this report. Whatever next. Breach of clause 9.1 failing to maintain high standards. There we go. Right, let's look at it. Pfizer accused of bringing discredit on the pharmaceutical industry after COVID 19 vaccination post is the headline. Now senior executives used social media to promote an unlicensed COVID vaccine according to this article. Pfizer found to have breached the regulatory code five times. Not four, not three, five times. Now this is from the prescriptions prescription medicines code of practice authority. Bit of a mouthful. But there you go. It's good to know that we have these watchdog still active in the UK. And it really is good that we do still have some vestiges of decency and accountability in the United Kingdom prescriptions medicines code of practice authority PMC P.A. Can't say I've been over familiar with it in the past, but good to know that they've made a ruling on this particular point. Now this relates to a complaint about a message posted on Twitter back in November 2020 by senior Pfizer employees. Now the complaint said this. The complainer alleged that it turned out that such misbehavior was even more widespread than they had thought. Wow, even more widespread than the thought. Extending light up to the top of their UK operation and was apparently continuing to this very day. Well, we couldn't possibly comment on that, of course, but we can say what the panel ruling said. The panel noted Pfizer submission. Sorry, this is still from the newspaper. The panel noted Pfizer submission that on further investigation to this complaint, four of the Pfizer UK colleagues, including another senior UK, a six senior colleague in the UK organization, retweeted the same post. Let's go on to the detail. Now this is from this actual report itself. Perfectly readable, perfect and understandable. You can read it all in about half an hour. Pretty straightforward report. Really, just check it out for yourself. I'll put the link in, as always, of course. The panel query where there are social media platforms, such as Tritter, was the appropriate form to share such information. Yeah, I would have thought that's fair to query. The panel noted the tweet contained limited information regarding the efficacy of the vaccine candidate with no safety information provided. It must have forgotten to include safety information, such as, oh, I don't know, adverse reactions, myocarditis, pericarditis, things like that. Cardiac A rhythm is, you probably just forgot to mention that. Of course, you probably limited for words on Twitter, aren't you? So maybe that's what the problem was. On the balance of probability, it was likely that the Pfizer UK employees' connection connections would include UK members of the public, as well as UK health professionals. So this would go to members of the public health professionals. Well, what I want to say this would, I mean, the reports of efficacy would, they wouldn't get any adverse reactions because I didn't mention that. At the panel noted that the three clearly were clearly referred to the outcomes of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine being developed to protect against COVID-19. The panel noted that clause three won prohibit the promotion of medicine prior to it's the grant of a marketing authorisation. They also said this, they must not mislead either directly or by implication, by distortion, exaggeration or undue emphasis. Material must be sufficiently complete to enable the recipient to form their own opinion of the therapeutic value of the medicine, the therapeutic value of the medicine. And in fact, I think we could probably extend this critique to all our governments really, couldn't we? We weren't really given a full balanced picture of the risk benefit analysis because the phrase was, what was it again? Oh, that was it. Safe and effective was the phrase used by my government. You might think that's a little unbalanced. Let me know what you think. The committee went on to say it must not be stated that a product has no adverse reactions because we know the product does have adverse reactions. It must not be stated that a product has no adverse reactions, toxic effects, toxic hazard, sorry, risk of addiction or dependency. The panel noted that the tweet made no reference to adverse events and was therefore concerned that important safety information relating to the vaccine candidate was not provided and ruled a breach of clause seven, etc. This was acknowledged by Pfizer, which is good. Fair cop may or come clean. Right, the panel noted, the panel noted Pfizer stated that the senior employee who retreated was the subject, who was the subject of this complaint had completed a social media training module in October 19. Right, so the senior executive who retreated this had completed a social media training module in 2019. He probably just forgot what he was taught unless there was another motive, but of course, we couldn't possibly speculate on that. He probably just forgot. He'd been maybe at a hangover, he'd been a bit tied in the study day. I mean, I've been to study days and sometimes you can't remember everything that said, so that's not unreasonable. Activity was clearly outside the company policy had not been taken down or deleted. Oh, dear, so it looks like the company forgot to take it down as well. Okay, or didn't notice it was there. Anyway, it was left up for a period of time. The article goes on in the in the telegraph this is, Unlicensed Medicine, Proactively Deseminated, Unlicensed Medicine has been proactive disseminated on Twitter to help professionals and members of the public in the UK. Pfizer, UK spokesman, fully recognises and accepted the issues highlighted by this PMCPA, which remind me of what that stands for. PMCPA stands for Prescription, Medicine's Code of Practice, Authority. Fully recognises the ruling and it's deeply sorry. Oh, there were deeply sorry, deeply sorry. Pfizer said it was accidental and unintentional. But it's the sixth time Pfizer has been reprimanded by the regulators over its promotion of the COVID vaccines. Presumably on each of these six occasions they may well have been accidental and unintentional and presumably they were also deeply sorry. Ben Kingsley was for them, excellent pioneering organisation, not pioneering, what's the word I'm looking for, campaigning organisation. It's astonishing how many times Pfizer's senior executives have been found guilty of serious regulatory offenses in this case, including the most serious offense of all under the UK Code of Practice. Yet the consequences for Pfizer and the individual's concern continue to be derisory. This hopeless system of regulation for a multi-billion dollar life and death industry has become a sham in dire need of a reform. Which sounds reasonable to me, I would have said, dire needed reform is a good description, but they did say the sorry. Now, remember that, actually that kind of links in a little bit, doesn't it, what I said at the start, that when I was just musing about going to a retail outlet that gave me disingenuous information, I didn't go back there. So I wonder if we can expect our governments to change the shops that they go to. Let's wait and find out, but don't hold your breath. Now, on a completely preposterous matter, there's been some intimations about my motorcycling activity. Some people even saying that I don't ride motorcycles. Now this is an evidence-based channel, and as you know, I've probably probably now been doing some work in Australia recently, but it did get time to do a quick bit of motorcycling. So I'm going to give evidence now of my limited capacity on a motorcycle, and I was being very responsible and riding very slowly. So let's take the evidence now. You don't take my word for this, evaluate the evidence. And you decide if this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate my motorcycling credentials. As has been questioned by some viewers. You decide for yourself, don't let me make your... I'm not here to think for you. I'm just here to make suggestions. Like Lawrence of Arabia coming out of the head, isn't it? Was that Omar Shereef? It was really sanded out there. You had to be really careful not to stick. Well, off-road, earth, in the direction of Alps. I was there to dilapidate, but burnt exactly. hour to a Just after this point I got lost. It's found again sometime. And while there's anyone still awake there you go. Just show you shouldn't take yourself too seriously. But serious points in this video as well. Thank you for watching."
Unusual Moderna vaccine side effect | Connect the Dots,THV11,2021-01-15,j7x2Bscdjic,"We've told you a lot about the COVID-19 vaccines, but there's one new development that's a little on the strange side. It's a side effect of the Moderna vaccine, but it's absolutely not a reason to skip the shot when it's your turn according to doctors. This is geared toward people who like a little cosmetic surgery. Let's connect the dots because wake up central helps you wake up smarter. The FDA has a warning about an unusual side effect for the Moderna coronavirus vaccine for patients with cosmetic facial fillers. Let's connect the dots. Facial fillers are a popular cosmetic procedure that helps smooth out wrinkles or creates the illusion of larger lips. According to reports in Los Angeles, the FDA Advisory Committee that reviewed the results of clinical trials for the Moderna vaccine noted a specific side effect for people in the trial who had cosmetic facial fillers. Inflammation and swelling where those fillers had been injected. A couple of the patients in question had facial fillers injected in their cheeks months before getting the vaccine. Another one had lip fillers a couple days after getting the vaccine. No word how bad the reactions were, but swelling and inflammation were reported. The patients were treated with steroids and antihistamines and they were covered. So why the swelling? Doctors say when you get a vaccine it revs up your immune system. And since fillers are technically a foreign object in your body, that revved up immune system may see it as a threat and attack causing a type of allergic reaction. But doctors do stress people with fillers should still get the vaccine since reactions were easily treated with common medications. Such a random issue to have there with the vaccine. But you heard him say, or heard him say, heard me say, that it's an easy fix whenever you have it, you know, that the side effects were not long lasting untreatable but just. Very interesting. My dad works in healthcare. So he's had both shots. I believe the Pfizer vaccine. And he had a like a mild fever and well like 101 and then I believe he had some body aches and everything. I don't think he dealt with the swelling, but then you know after 24 hours each time he was pretty much back to normal. So I think it just it really depends. You might experience a little this and that, but overall. You could say the benefits are a lot better than you know some of the side effects. So the doctors say to you. Absolutely. All right. It's got some to over to you."
COVID vaccine questions: Severe side effects after first dose?,Click On Detroit | Local 4 | WDIV,2021-02-10,dGpnGily_7M,"Several viewers have asked if it's okay to take a painkiller like ibuprofen or Tylenol to manage their side effects after getting vaccinated. There is some theoretical concern about reducing your body's immune response, so if you don't need it, don't take it. But if your pain is significant, it's fine to treat it. In fact, I took some ibuprofen about 12 hours after my second vaccination help manage my side effects, and it didn't seem to be a problem. Now here are some more of your questions. Camila asks, I'm a teacher with the Detroit Public Schools and recently had my first dose of Moderna. The side effects were more intense than I imagine. I expected the sore arm, but I did not expect nausea and malaise, and did not expect to be in and out of bed the next couple days. I wonder if you've heard of severe side effects after the first dose? I'm terrified of the second dose. The first dose is less likely to produce significant side effects, but they can occur. You shouldn't skip the second dose, though. It's necessary to boost the protection to the maximum benefit, making any side effects well worth it. Just be sure you have some time off schedule to recuperate if you have a similar response. Now, another viewer asks, if you have symptoms after receiving the vaccine, are you contagious? If you have side effects from the vaccine, no, you are not contagious. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not contain any live virus. Just to be clear, though, if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 after getting the vaccine, you still need to get tested. The vaccine is not instantly effective, which means a person could be infected just before or after getting the vaccine and still get sick. Lisa asks, how long after the second Moderna shot is it fully in effect? The most accurate information I can give is the phase 3 trial by Moderna documented a 94 percent efficacy 14 days after the second dose. The Pfizer vaccine had a documented efficacy of 95 percent 7 days after the second dose. That said, the effectiveness of the vaccines isn't an on-off switch. There is a protective effect that occurs earlier, even after the first dose. We just don't have enough data to put an exact number on it. Karen asks, one here is a lot about having side effects from the vaccine just means that the vaccine is working to build your immune system. But if you have no side effects, does that mean your immune system is not being bolstered by the vaccine? No. Some people just don't have side effects. Consider yourself lucky. A viewer asks, is it true you should not take any medications the day of your vaccination but take them after? No. You should continue to take all your usual daily medications unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. Now finally, Simon wrote, it's going to be five days prior to the Super Bowl after I was vaccinated. Can I have a few beers during the game and not have adverse reactions? Okay, so Simon, I am sorry I didn't get to your question before the Super Bowl, but for future festivities, the answer is yes. There is no reason to avoid alcohol after the vaccine."
Are there more side effects with the Moderna vaccine?,WBAL-TV 11 Baltimore,2021-05-21,1iqjPsK7c5c,"All this week we're getting the facts on the vaccine. 11 news has collected more than 100 questions from you, our viewers about the COVID-19 vaccine each day. And in every newscast we answer a question and today's question is why do people who get the Moderna vaccine have way more side effects afterwards than people who get the Pfizer? The Moderna mRNA and Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccines are very similar in terms of not only how they work but also the side effect profiles. Some studies may show that there are slightly more side effects with one versus the other, but in general they're so similar that it really depends on the individual. And I would not advise choosing one type of vaccine over another in order to avoid any extra side effects. And in the end the decision to get vaccinated is yours. We just want to make sure whatever decision you make it's based on facts, not social media."
Vaxx Facts - Long-Term Side Effects of the COVID-19 Vaccines,University of Iowa Health Care,2021-09-20,ntul5g_UFqI,"There are a lot of myths circulating about COVID-19, one of which is that the vaccines were developed too quickly to be safe. Let's get to the bottom of this with some facts. mRNA vaccines like the Pfizer-Biontech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines and coronaviruses have been studied for decades. When COVID-19 emerged we were able to use existing research to develop an mRNA vaccine that would protect us from COVID-19. The first COVID-19 vaccine trials began in March of 2020 and the first COVID-19 vaccine was authorized for emergency use in December of 2020. This means that some people have had the vaccine for nine months to a year and a half. This is plenty of time for long-term side effects to present themselves. 2.33 billion people have been vaccinated for COVID-19 so far and we haven't seen any evidence of major long-term side effects. We know a few other things about vaccines that should give you some peace of mind. Vaccines are eliminated from the body quickly. Once they do their job preparing your body toward off the future infections, they're eliminated from the body. Common side effects like headache, fever and fatigue usually occur within 24 hours following the injection but they subside within a few days. Unusual vaccine side effects typically show up within days to weeks of being vaccinated if at all. The mRNA vaccines have had a remarkable ability to prevent COVID-19 infections and have had very, very few unusual side effects. There are a lot of myths circulating about COVID-19. If you have questions about anything related to COVID-19, including the vaccine and the potential side effects, be sure to talk to your doctor to get information you can trust."
"AZ vs. Moderna side effects | Insider EXTRA, July 1, 2021 | Taiwan Insider on RTI",RTI English,2021-07-05,1TcXxTZIrSY,"For the past couple of months in Taiwan, if you've gotten a COVID-19 jab, you've probably gotten a dose of AstraZeneca. But now there's a new kid on the block, Moderna. So how do the vaccines differ? And what are the side effects? Here's more. Taiwan's supply of COVID-19 vaccines continues to grow. The latest shipment containing 410,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine arrived Wednesday afternoon. Most of those vaccinated in Taiwan in the near future are likely to get the Moderna vaccine because Taiwan has a relatively large supply of doses. But there are still doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine ready for use. And doctors like the Opang Chir of Sinkong Wu Ho Su Memorial Hospital say that people shouldn't be overly concerned about which vaccine they get. There are, of course, differences. Leabing in of the Central Epidemic Command Center says, the AstraZeneca vaccine can lead to blood clots while the Moderna can lead to myocarditis. Ants of pain at the injection site, fever, and chills differ between the two vaccines, too, as does the overall rate of effectiveness. But the general consensus among doctors here is that serious side effects from these two vaccines are rare, and there is no need to be picky when it comes to which vaccine to get."
"""COVID arm"" Moderna side effect, no cause for alarm",KHON2 News,2021-03-30,91IIRXTWJJc,"There are a number of minor side effects people are reporting after getting vaccinated. One of them from the Moderna vaccine is being called COVID arm. Gen Bonisa explains. COVID arm is a rash and it's one of the possible side effects of the Moderna shot, but doctors say it's nothing to be alarmed about. Alex Reimtrecht was excited to get vaccinated. He booked his appointment at CBS a week and a half ago. So I got the Moderna vaccine and initial reaction was just a little soreness in the injection site. He says initially he didn't have any other adverse reactions. Then eight days later this happened suddenly and out of nowhere. I got this big egg that grew on my arm and it was just super itchy and painful to the touch. After doing a little digging online, he found out he had COVID arm, a term given to a rash that some develop after getting the Moderna shot. According to Dr. Alan Wu, it's a minor localized reaction. It can be itchy, red, painful and a little swollen and that's what are caused by the vaccine in what we call a delayed T cell mediated response, hypersensitivity response. Though annoying and sore, Wu says it's harmless and should go away within a week. It hurts, you know, it takes some time and all or some IV profit that can help with a swelling. And if it's really itchy, you can take some binaural. According to a report by the new England Journal of Medicine, fewer than one person of people who get the Moderna shot had the reaction and about half of those had it again after the second shot. According to the CDC, if you get COVID arm, you should still get your second shot. They suggest getting it in the other arm. Rhyme Prick says the possibility of getting COVID is much worse than getting a temporary rash. It's just an inconvenience and, you know, I do it again. I'm looking forward to my second shot. All I'm going to do is get the injection on the other arm this time, just in case."
Does the COVID-19 Vaccine Cause Long-Term Effects?,Cleveland Clinic,2021-11-22,VaSDSdR4R-E,"We have had dozens and dozens of vaccines available for the last many decades. And we have seen absolutely no long-term side effects from any of these vaccines. And we're more than a year out from the first people who got vaccinated against COVID, and we still have not seen any long-term effects from them. But the real risks that we've been hearing about, the inflammation of the heart and the blood clots that are possible, have happened in a tiny fraction of people who have gotten the COVID vaccine. We're talking maybe five per million. And when you look at the risk of what COVID does to you and the risks of dying, which are much greater than that, a tiny risk from the vaccine is certainly something that you want to overcome. Get the vaccine, keep yourself safe from COVID."
"Yes, Moderna's COVID vaccine may produce a higher antibody level than Pfizer",11Alive,2021-10-11,Z-aKVXMCqYc,"As talks of booster shots continue to ramp up, some are now turning online to compare COVID-19 vaccines. Lides of Lucas takes your questions to the experts in Verify. Chris asked the Verify team to take a closer look at headlines online. Does the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine produce more antibodies than Pfizer? Let's verify. Our sources are two recent studies comparing antibody response between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Dr. Jeffrey Wilson immunologist with the University of Virginia School of Medicine study and Dr. Harry Hyman, Public Health Expert at Georgia State University. Let's start with a small study from UVA. Researchers found antibody levels in UVA employees who got the Moderna vaccine were slightly higher than in recipients of Pfizer. The biggest difference related to age. We can really see that the difference was more pronounced in older folks in terms of the difference between Pfizer and Moderna. Their findings align with another study that looked at fully vaccinated Belgium healthcare workers. That study found double the amount of antibodies in those who received the Moderna vaccine than those who received Pfizer. Scientists behind both studies caution they only looked at certain antibody types while the immune system is quite complex. But the antibody difference could be due to the difference in timing and dosing of the two vaccines. I think we're going to verify that is being true, is that Moderna probably does elicit a little bit higher antibody level. But the next really important question is does it matter? If Pfizer is eliciting enough antibody to give strong protection, then a little bit more antibody maybe it matters, maybe it doesn't matter. And right now I don't think we know that. So Chris, we can verify it's true. Recent studies show Moderna can produce a higher antibody level than Pfizer. But whether this new data is relevant to vaccine effectiveness remains to be seen. It's important to do these studies and to understand the differences, but from the first of the general public, I'm not sure that there's any relevance right now that should be important to them. Have something for us to verify? Send us an email or text us at 404-885-7600."
What are the side effects of the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines?,South Shore Health,2021-01-21,CIOMEEazPiM,"The one that comes to mind is the local one. You'll get a shot, you get some discomfort there, you can get headache, you can get fatigue. Some people get a temperature which is not unusual. With this particular vaccine, after you get the second dose, the side effects tend to be a little bit more severe and people get more body aches. But the key thing is that you should not think you have COVID because you got the vaccine because that's what people ask. They're like, oh, I got COVID from the vaccine. And we did not mention that this is not a live vaccine. So that's really important to stress that this is not a live virus. Great point, that's right. It's not a live vaccine. You cannot get COVID-19 from either of these vaccines. I do want to say one thing. You mentioned the important point to expect these side effects. And they're very similar between Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Maybe the Moderna vaccine has a numerically a little bit higher amount of side effects, but I don't even know if it's statistically significant between the two. You mentioned the common ones. I think what is important is to remember that while many people, maybe most people do have some side effects from both vaccines, they tend to resolve quickly within one to two days. And that is one way to distinguish something like COVID-19 or another viral illness that you could get coincidentally versus just the side effects from this, which really should go away within 48 hours. And they most of them occur within 72 hours. Absolutely, but I will make sure we stress the point that if something is going on beyond 72 hours that you need to contact your healthcare provider just to discuss if there's something else going on because things should have resolved, like you said, within 72 hours."
5 Most Common Pfizer vs Moderna Vaccine Side Effects Comparison,DoctorSecrets,2021-06-28,dUn4w44r13E,"The Doctor is in. Welcome back guys, it's your pal Dr. Sal again and today we are going to take a look at it. Alright, so very quickly, a lot of people have been offered the choice between Pfizer and Moderna and a question that a key getting is which one should you get. Based on side effect profile, they both effective against the COVID-19, they're both mRNA vaccines. So, in head to head trials, which one is tolerated better? So we're going to put P here for Pfizer, M here for Moderna and then we're going to look at the stats. So first off, the most common side effect for both was injection site pain, just from where the needle pokes in your arm, for Pfizer that came out at 84 percent, for Moderna it was reported in 92 percent of takers. For tiredness after the injection, that in Pfizer was listed in 63 percent of takers and for Moderna, the rate of that was 70 percent. For headaches, we're looking at 55 percent in Pfizer and for Moderna, the headache was 65 percent. For muscle aches, for Pfizer, we're looking at 38 percent and for Moderna, the muscle aches or myaldias were about 62 percent. For chills, and we're not talking about chilling, we're talking about shaking and feeling cold as though you had the common cold, Pfizer, we're looking at 32 percent. As opposed to Moderna, which was, where was it again, 45 percent. So you can see in the head-to-head trials, assuming that we're comparing apples, apples, and oranges to oranges. So with the assumption that the studies done in both are equivalent and there's not something magnifying results on one side and minimizing them on the other, the head-to-head trials suggest that the Pfizer comes out king and Moderna, not so much in terms of side effects. There was more injection pain on Moderna, more fatigue, more headache, more muscle aches, and more chills. That being said, a lot of these side effects are very, very short self-limiting, we're looking at three to five days and they're also minor. There's no indication from these studies how intense each of these things was just whether it was reported or not. So it is possible that even though there were more cases reported here, maybe there were more severe over here, we just don't know. So the question is, which should you get? I would say whichever one you can get because it doesn't matter to me, these differences are very small and fleeting, not that big of a deal. We're just looking at very slight margins, but compared to contracting the actual COVID-19, the real deal, you'll be getting all this plus more. So to me, it all comes out to availability. If you really have your deathors and contours, whichever you want, I probably go with this one, which is actually what I did do in real life. I didn't get the Pfizer one. However, if push came to shove and it was limited supply, I would take whichever one I could get. So that's my take on it, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks so much for watching and wish a great rest of your day. So don't hesitate, don't vacillate, vaccinate."
"If You Got Pfizer/Moderna Vaccine, FDA Says Expect These Delayed Side Effects",Dating Coach Ella,2021-07-01,_xUo7iqKCWU,"If you got Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, FDA says expect these delayed side effects. COVID-19 vaccines are tested rigorously for safety and efficacy. And during the initial vaccine rollout, the most common side effects include fever, headache, fatigue and soreness at the injection side. These effects can also be experienced in other medications and are considered normal. However, rare adverse events were reported by some recipients, needing health authorities to make the necessary investigations. On June 25, the US Food and Drug Administration added new warnings on two COVID vaccines with emergency use of authorization. While the agency recommends getting these vaccines whenever possible, it wanted to relay critical information to caregivers, health workers and patients. The warnings are to ensure the safety of those who may be at risk of certain conditions. Remember, the benefits of these vaccines sell outweigh the risks, especially with the Delta variant running AMOQ. According to Yahoo, the warnings were added two days after the US CDC advisory committee on immunization practices confirmed the likely association between myocarditis and pericard diodes and Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The association is considered very rare, mild and treatable. Those who were scheduled for vaccination should be notified of what brand they will get. FDA advised that recipients must have vaccination providers if they have a history of myocarditis or pericarditis. The former is the inflammation of the heart muscle, while the latter is the inflammation of the lining outside the heart. This is because either condition has occurred in some of those who receive these vaccines. Although the chances are low, patients are advised to monitor freaky symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath and feelings of having a fast beating, fluttering or pounding heart. If they experience even just one of these signs, they may seek medical attention immediately to get treated. At the end of the revised warnings, the FDA says that no known unexpected side effects may occur since the vaccines are still being studied. Besides the aforementioned heart conditions, vaccines may cause allergic reactions in those with allergies to one vaccine component. Severe allergic reactions may lead to anaphylaxis which must be treated right away. Severe allergic reactions may result in rash, hives and itching which also need medical attention. Dr. James Dilemmas at UT Southwestern Medical Center said, it's not something that people in my view should be afraid of, because the risks are low and the benefits of vaccination are overwhelming."
"Dr. Celine Gounder On FDA Moderna Review, Pfizer Vaccine Side Effects | Andrea Mitchell | MSNBC",MSNBC,2020-12-17,JSuLgX4842E,"News expected from Moderna with the advisory board meeting today on their recommendation, combined with the discovery that extra doses were found within the initial Pfizer shipments to help operation warp speed. Do you think that will help them hit the 20 million doses goal by the end of the year that they have been proclaiming? I just asked Monsaf Sally a couple of days ago and he said there's still on track despite the supply chain problems with Pfizer. Well, what the US government has been promised is 100 million doses in total from Pfizer. Some of that to come by the end of the calendar year, some in early 2021. 100 million doses means 50 million people vaccinated. And if we have six instead of five doses per vial, that means that you would go up to 60 million instead of 50 million people vaccinated. That is certainly helpful. That's an improvement. But you have to remember, we have 330 million people in this country. And so that inches us towards that goal, but it's not a game changer. And Moderna is about to have twice as much as the initial amount that Pfizer had. If it gets approved, if it's approved this week and if it starts rolling next week, which seems likely, according to everything we're hearing so far. Yeah, and I think this is really promising. They have very similar technologies, very similar levels of efficacy, essentially the same. And I think what is helpful with respect to the Moderna vaccine is that it has also been shown to be stable at temperatures that are more typical for vaccine storage. So not the ultra cold temperatures that the Pfizer vaccine requires. So it means it'll be easier to distribute the Moderna vaccine. For example, in rural areas, regular doctors offices that don't have those ultra cold freezers. We did hear about two health care workers in Alaska having what they called fairly minor reactions, allergic reactions. But one of them, at least, was in the hospital overnight with IV meds had to be repeatedly medicated before that person came out of what appears to be anaphylaxis. And supposedly that person had no prior experience with anaphylaxis. So would not have been someone heeding the obvious warnings that have already been attached to the Pfizer vaccine. Right. Well, this is also why we're at currently advising that everybody who's vaccinated remain at the vaccination facility for observation for at least 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, because they do have on-site epinephrine or the epipens that we use to treat such a reaction. It's also important to remember that even if this is a 1 in a million kind of reaction, when you're going to be vaccinating as many people as we will be, again, 330 million people in this country alone, 1 in a million translates to 330 anaphylactic reactions. So you are going to be hearing about this. This should be no surprise. I think the key is to remember that this is something that we can treat and that no one has had serious complications from. This is something we can manage. The states, of course, have authority in our system to order different priorities as to who gets the first vaccines after the health care workers, the nursing home residents. There are different definitions of emergency workers, though we're seeing competition now from groups representing firefighters, food workers, teachers, and arguably black and Latino communities who have had such disproportionate results being affected by COVID and deaths or older Americans with comorbidities. So what about minority communities? Shouldn't they have a place high up in line? How do you make these decisions between different groups and won't different states obviously have different priorities? Well, certainly different states will have different priorities in part because they have different industries. And so the specific critical infrastructure groups that are in any particular state may not always be identical. You know, the other thing with respect to communities of color is they do tend to be concentrated in those critical infrastructure jobs, those frontline essential worker jobs. And so by prioritizing those professions, you are in fact prioritizing the needs of communities of color who have been hit so hard in part because they are in those jobs.

COVID-19 vaccine side effects of both Moderna and Pfizer,WWLP-22News,2020-12-09,G64o3MjRu7g,"Conducted in November by a mass ink pulled in group reported that the majority of Massachusetts residents planned to get the vaccine once available. 20th's news reporter Katrina Kincaid is live in studio to explain what we know about the side effects of the vaccine. Side effects of both Moderna and Pfizer's vaccine have been shown to be mild to moderate, soreness, muscle aches, fever and fatigue that ended in one to two days. The data and safety monitoring board an independent group of experts via the National Institutes of Health found side effects of the Moderna trial vaccine or more pronounced after the second dose. But health experts don't expect any severe long-term side effects. We spoke to one woman who hopes to be one of the first people to get the vaccine here. Well, I think I'm going to be maybe second or third in line to get it, and I think it's worth getting, and I don't see any reason why people would be scared to take it. It's just going to give you peace of mind. United Kingdom health regulators say people who have a significant history of allergic reactions shouldn't get the Pfizer vaccine. After two people had adverse reactions, but both people are recovering well, and the UK is investigating the cause. US documents from the FDA say Pfizer's vaccine was strongly protective against the coronavirus and ultimately appeared safe. Keep watching 20 News at noon for more information on those two allergic reactions to the vaccine. Working for you, Katrina Kincaid, 22 News."
You ask. We answer. | What are common side effects for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine,FOX 61,2021-05-04,BnEBYIhdFA4,"We are getting more questions about side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines. A viewer wrote to Fox 61. I have a Moderna side effect question. I got my second vaccine yesterday and woke up with a swollen side of my face and I on the same side of my body where I was vaccinated. Is this a common side effect? Should I be concerned? This is definitely not a common side effect. And if you woke up with swelling on the right side of your face that is concerning and that's why the CDC has two different ways of reporting this either through the V safe app which you can download on your phone and report it or the vaccine adverse reaction reporting system which you can report to the CDC because it's not a common reaction. It's also a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider if you are having side effects so that you can be monitored.

Moderna Vaccine Causes Side Effect In Recipients With Fillers,FOX 5 San Diego,2020-12-27,VLB5xrmBYq4,"Coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are now approved for emergency use, but there's an unusual side effect. For some who have taken the Moderna vaccine, Fox Eyes Misha DiBono explains how the reaction is linked to a certain cosmetic procedure. Some participants in Moderna's coronavirus vaccine trial are turning up with an unexpected side effect. You know, out of the 30,000 subject trial, there are three events that they noted and during the FBA trial and two of them actually experienced swelling in the cheeks. And one had a filler placed about two weeks prior to vaccination and the other one was six months prior. The FD Advisory Committee reviewing the vaccine noted the very specific side effects involving several trial participants who had cosmetic facial fillers in their cheeks and lips. There are many different types of fillers, but the most common is a hyaluronic acid. Not all fillers are created equal. There's some fillers which are more bio-stimulators that can activate the immune system more and can be looked at by your immune system as foreign as opposed to others like hyaluronic acid. So a discussion with your doctor is very important when it comes to a coin to the FDA, nearly three million Americans got fillers last year to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. So what's the connection? Whenever we get a vaccine, we're asking our bodies and our immune system to respond to an antigen and you can have kind of a generalized ramping up with your immune system. And if it recognizes something that is foreign, it can try to attack it. The good news in all the cases, the reaction was easily treatable. It resolved with treatments with anti-histamines and also steroids. So it's also important to have this conversation and we want to really educate not just the general public, but also practitioners that perform filler procedures because if something like this does happen, you know, catching it early and treating it early will make it better for the patients."
Finland limits Moderna COVID-19 vaccine use over rare cardiovascular side effect | ANC,ANC 24/7,2021-10-07,tNRsn1tFiYI,"Finland joins Sweden and Denmark in limiting the use of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine on a younger population given its possible side effects. We have this report. Finland paused the use of Moderna's COVID vaccine for younger males on Thursday. It comes after reports of a rare cardiovascular side effect, myocarditis. Finnish officials said they would instead give Pfizer's vaccine to men born in 1991 and later. The country currently offers shots to people aged 12 and over. Both Sweden and Denmark limited the use of Moderna on Wednesday for all young adults and children. They cited the same unpublished Nordic study as Finland. Sweden's lead epidemiologist Anders Tegnel. It is, as I said, a very rare side effect we're talking about, even if one has received the Moderna vaccine. Almost all the cases appear after a few weeks following vaccination. And after one month, one doesn't see this problem at all. Another Scandinavian country, Norway, recommended this week that men under the age of 30 choose the Pfizer vaccine. The Finnish Health Institute said the report would be published within a couple of weeks and that the data had been sent to the European Medicines Agency for further assessment. The EMA found in July that such inflammatory heart conditions could occur in very rare cases following vaccination with spike-vacs or the Pfizer jab in younger men after the second dose. Moderna spokesperson said late Wednesday it was aware of the decision made by Sweden and Denmark. The drugmaker said the cases were typically mild and individuals usually recovered within a short time frame following standard treatment and rest. Adding that the risk of myocarditis is substantially increased for those who get COVID with vaccination the best way to protect against this. US President Joe Biden is defending his COVID-19 vaccine mandate on federal workers and on large businesses. The order which covers 100 million U.S. workers has been getting pushed back from high profile Republicans since last month. But Biden insists that vaccinations are key to economic growth. In his trip to Chicago Thursday, he urged more private companies to get their employees inoculated against COVID-19 which has already killed over 700 thousand Americans. When I first started the vaccination program and we got all that vaccine enough for everyone we're vaccinating three million people a day. We're getting very close before things began to slow down. The economy is growing leaps and bounds. Six percent the fastest growing major economy in the world. In fact, increased vaccination coverage of results in as many as five million American workers going back to work because they feel safe they can go back to work. There'll be more economic demand to drive people back to the workforce. The United Kingdom will remove the Philippines from its so-called travel red list starting October 11th. This means that fully vaccinated Filipinos can now travel to Britain without taking COVID-19 tests prior to their flights or without completing a 10-day quarantine upon arrival. Travelers must however be fully vaccinated at least 10 days before arriving in the United Kingdom. It must also present proof of vaccination. Approved vaccines include AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen. With the easing of the travel restrictions only Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, rather, will remain on the UK's red list after October 11th."
Doctors Warn Of Delayed Side Effects From Moderna Vaccine,Health Digest,2021-03-17,JMDuXz_7ooI,"The rush is on. People everywhere are trying to get their COVID-19 vaccine, but a troubling skin reaction has some people second-guessing getting the Moderna vaccine in particular. But it turns out there's no cause for alarm. The reaction is known informally as COVID-arm or Moderna arm, and it first made waves in January, as reported by USA Today. And while the size of the reaction frighten some people, the outlet reported it was nothing to worry about. It turns out they were right. The reaction is thought to be harmless. The new England Journal of Medicine has recently released a new letter advising doctors on how to approach COVID-arm. As the lead author on the paper states, the letter was written in the hopes that more doctors will become aware of the relatively rare reaction. This will, in turn, allow doctors to reassure patients who might be concerned if they develop the signature raised red rash. Dr. Kimberly G. Blumenthal wrote in the letter, ""...are immediate goal is to make physicians and other care providers aware of this possible delayed reaction, so they are not alarmed, but instead well-informed and equipped to advise their patients accordingly."" Dr. Blumenthal is the co-director of the Clinical Epidemiology Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. She specializes in rheumatology, allergy, and immunology, which has given her the skills necessary to advise on this unusual side effect, because COVID-arm is essentially a delayed, localized, allergic reaction. The reaction isn't too dissimilar to a mosquito bite, and the comparison might seem too simplistic, but it's fairly accurate. Mosquito bites turn red, swell, and itch, because the bite releases chemicals into our skin that triggers an immune system response. And what dearly vaccine does essentially the same thing, although the reaction can be pom-sized. A press release from Massachusetts General Hospital earlier this month referred to it as a delayed, allergic immune response. Dr. Esther Freeman, a co-author of the letter wrote, ""...For most people who are experiencing this, we believe it's tied to the body's immune system going to work."" The initial cases of the side effect were recorded after 12 people out of 30,000 trial participants reported the rash. Of these 12, one was misdiagnosed with a skin infection and prescribed antibiotics. As the rash treated the rash using corticosteroids, a class of drugs described by the Cleveland Clinic as anti-inflammatory medications used to treat skin conditions and some forms of arthritis. But most of the 12 people, originally affected by Moderna arm, simply used ice and over-the-counter anti-allergy medication. The thing that sets this apart from other types of allergic reactions is the time it takes to develop. Most cases started six to 11 days after vaccination, a week or so after that, and the rash was gone. Researchers are still looking into why the rash takes time to appear, however. They ask anyone who receives the Moderna vaccine to report allergic reactions to their research registry. A person's chances of developing COVID arm are incredibly low. 12 out of 30,000 comes out to less than 0.05 percent. Dr. Freeman voiced some concern, the number might be slightly higher, as the original 12 were only those who developed the rash eight or more days after vaccination. But she also cautioned that people have allergic reactions to standard vaccines as well. And there is good news for those small percentage of people who may develop the side effect. While the 12 who have reported cases, only six reported another case after receiving the second shot. And none of them had a worse reaction the second time. Three of those people had a similarly negative reaction to their first vaccine, and three had a slightly less negative reaction, according to the findings sent to the New England Journal of Medicine. There is a lot of concern around vaccines right now, and when people hear about a rash that might develop after they get their Moderna vaccine, it makes sense that they would be worried. But any given person's chances of developing Moderna arm are less than 1 percent, and there is no indication that the second round of vaccines will create a more aggressive reaction, and may, in fact, cause no reaction at all. Even if it does, those who have experienced it have recovered completely without lasting effects. Dr. James McDonald of the Rhode Island Department of Health told WPRI that Moderna arm should not cause concern. If it itches, people taking any histamine like plereton, or, you know, if it hurts, you take some tunnel, it really is nothing to be worried about. As Dr. Blumenthal put it in her letter, whether you've experienced a rash at the injection site right away, or this delayed skin reaction, neither condition should prevent you from getting the second dose of the vaccine.

"Moderna Sues Pfizer, BioNTech Alleging Patent Infringement Over Covid Vaccine",NBC News,2022-08-26,kB2sziggQ0o,"Vaccine developer Moderna is suing its competitors Pfizer and BioNTech, accusing the two companies of patent infringement over the COVID vaccine. Moderna is saying in part, quote, we believe that Pfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna's inventions and they have continued to use them without permission. NBC News legal analyst Danny Savalos is joining me now. So Danny, walk us through your understanding of this lawsuit and what Moderna is looking to get out of it. Moderna, who I learned is actually a name based on modified RNA. Claims they pioneered the practice or the technology for that eventually went into the COVID vaccine and that the defendants, even though they had plenty of options of pursuing different ways of achieving the same results, simply copied their method. And that is the essence of their patent allegation claims. So Danny, we should note that Pfizer denies Moderna's claims at this point and the company has said in part, we remain confident in our intellectual property supporting the Pfizer, BioNTech vaccine and will vigorously defend against the allegations of this lawsuit. Danny, what could happen if Moderna does when a case like this? The potential damages in a patent infringement case are very steep, even more steep when you have two gigantic companies that are suing each other and that have made a lot of money. It is possible that the defendants couldn't end up paying a big portion of the profits that they have made from this patent infringement if and it's a big if, a court determines that they did in fact infring the plaintiffs' patents."
Moderna slapped with patent infringement lawsuit,KTLA 5,2022-02-28,Ym5mtZa4zhY,"It's facing another lawsuit now accused of stealing the technology used to create its vaccine. Two small biotech firms Arbutis and Genvant claimed that Moderna infringed on their patent for a non-particle technology that was key in developing the MRNA vaccine. Now the two groups say it took years of painstaking work to develop and refine it, and Moderna would not have been able to produce a vaccine in record breaking time without it. The lawsuit claims Moderna's initial manuscript of how its vaccine was made includes details that exactly matched those patents. Now this is the second high profile lawsuit Moderna is facing surrounding its vaccine. Moderna says it expects its sales to top 19 billion dollars this year."
Moderna under growing pressure to share technology so low-income countries can use it,CBS Mornings,2021-11-24,lc48JAGHUew,"Turning now to the pandemic, there are huge global differences over which countries have access to COVID vaccines. Just 10 percent of people in Africa have received a single dose. Compare that to 63 percent in North America or 62 percent in Europe. Now, a South African startup is getting support from the World Health Organization to replicate Moderna's vaccine. Deborah Patta got a look at their efforts. A pair of nondescript warehouses and a dusty part of Cape Town is the unlikely home to a revolution. I love it. You don't know what's behind these rollercoats. Inside the airlock to stir our rooms, you'll find a band of rebels, albeit in white lab coats, passionate about using science to change the world. So, this is where the manufacturing will start? Avergine's managing director says their aim is to overcome the vaccine in equalities laid painfully bare by the COVID pandemic. Although there is massive efforts to scale up production in the facilities in the high-income countries, those vaccines first vaccinated to people in the high-income countries. So, African countries have to wait. As a result, less than 5 percent on the continent are fully vaccinated. Technical director Dr. Karen Finner says the pandemic was a wake-up call. Because it made us realize if we don't step up and do it ourselves, no one else is going to do it. After pleading with big farmer to share their racepiece, these scientists are done waiting and have taken the development of a COVID vaccine into their own hands. Avergine is replicating Moderna's mRNA vaccine, together with WITSE University in Johannesburg, who have mastered the difficult science needed to manufacture mRNA. Despite Moderna's stated commitment to global vaccine access, they have not given their permission. The dream here is not just to replicate but innovate the vaccine, to create a freeze-dried version that doesn't require cold storage. The World Health Organization is backing this effort so that Africa can reduce its reliance on outside companies. But so many health experts glow, but they have said it couldn't be done. Africa can't do it. They can't produce an mRNA vaccine. I think we have a surprise for the list of the world we can. And we will. The kind of determination needed on this COVID battlefront, it takes rebels in lab coats to even the field. For CBS Mornings, Deborah Patter, Cape Town. Rebels in lab coats and they look like they want to get it done."
US first country to approve Moderna Covid-19 vaccine,The National News,2020-12-19,nY3Rw7Racck,you you
Moderna deal should not ‘change what we’re doing’ with the vaccination program,Sky News Australia,2021-05-12,FN3foHnbfok,"What do you make of this deal? It's good news. I suppose what I'd say to individuals is that look, it is for later in the year and it really shouldn't delay what's going on now. So if you've still, when you get your shot and your time comes up, go get it. But it is good news. I think the lesson we've learned over time, though, we really need to see the supplies actually learning here and the next job is to get in people's arms. But this is good news for particularly later in the year and into next year, almost the next stage of potential vaccinations or boosts that we may be looking at. So primarily, Doctor, who's this for? Who's going to be the beneficiary of this? Well, I think to some degree, it's nice to have this as an insurance for later and also possibility that we may have to cover off on things like variants, if there's evidence that we need to do that. But look, I think this is almost like an insurance policy and it's important to have that there because as you've seen right throughout the whole, that scene program, there are changes to the vaccine advice, but also changes in terms of supply and it's fluctuated so much. So this gives a bit of protection if there's actually changes that occur later. So would it be more? I mean, I've read this morning that it may well be more for the people aged under 50 given that there's a shortfall with AstraZeneca jobs now. So would it suit people aged under 50 better than say those aged over 50 or does it not really matter? Well, we're interestingly, we've got a fair bit of Pfizer that's coming in around about that same time. So when you add the amount of Pfizer doses plus the amount of Moderna doses, we're technically having enough for the whole population. The issue with both the Pfizer and Moderna is the time frame that they're going to come in. And that's really towards the more towards the end of the year. Pfizer's coming in in sort of a constant amount, but really the bulk is going to come in by the end of the year. And then the donors are only going to start coming in towards the later part of the year. So really, they're really sort of something in the distance. And what we need to do is keep on going with the vaccination program as we have now. Do you think this is a deal that should have been struck a lot earlier? Look, I think one could say that. Behind the scenes, I know that a lot of people are calling out all the time saying, oh, God, get into negotiations now. Can I tell you that in a seller's market with vaccines and we know that vaccines are, you know, everybody's after the moment. The government is not going to be telegraphing what they're doing. They're not going to go and say, public, oh, we're desperately going to go out and go do this. So look for those people who are not really understand what's going on. The government are very quietly doing their job, but they really are not out public telegraphing what they're going to do. In terms of the Varderna one, there were issues with this in terms of my understanding. You know, it was in this sort of very similar to Pfizer type situation. So Pfizer was first off the bat, really. But in terms of telegraphing and delays in sort of negotiations, a lot of these probably have been occurring in the background, but not really telegraphed to the public. There may will be more delays too. I mean, Moderna has had issues getting some of its vaccines to countries beyond the US previously. Well, and this gets back to my point about the fact that this is good news to have this sort of insurance policy for later. If we have to pivot again in terms of vaccination program, but we've got to keep vaccinating now. And we have the AstraZeneca being the real core part of our vaccine program. We know that it prevents serious disease. We need to vaccinate that over most seriously or most vulnerable group, which is the over 50 because we need to get past that first stage. So really having this is great in the background, but it really shouldn't change what we're doing as far as the vaccination program now. And those sort of hanging out for that in the year. Got to remember we've got to get through another winter. And the lesson has been let the winter's not a good time for COVID. No, that's true. But there's also the potential for local manufacturing of this Moderna vaccine too, right? I mean, how significant would that be? And in what sort of time frame do you think that could be set up? Look, in the past, my understanding is a lot longer than then sort of people are advertising. And maybe they can do it. It's going to require investment again, really. This is there's probably commercial issues that come into play in here. And certainly people sort of put out their hands and they can do it. Well, that's great, but I think we need the government really needs to look at the detail about what can happen again. Saying that you're going to do thing saying you're going to do something is different from actually doing it. And that's the lesson. And I think even the government have lived that they've been promising about targets is not a great thing in the vaccine program. So look positive news, but let's let's let's let's on the other hand, hope for the best. But could be years, could be years before it's manufactured locally. Well, I mean, that's the thing. I mean, I think this is significant technology. It does get back to the fact that Australia hasn't been in the environment, you know, like Europe in the UK has been at the forefront. Of medication and vaccine manufacture. Like we don't we can't do that sort of heavy third phase trial and stuff like that because we actually send a send a best and brightest overseas because we don't have that. And the aim is actually pushing towards the government towards considering really longer term ideas about sovereignty as far as ability to manufacture both medications and vaccines, which has the benefit of having this ability to upscale. Technology far more quickly in the future. Okay, Chris Boy, thanks doctor. Always good to chat. Talk to you soon. It's a pleasure."
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Shipped Across Country,CBS New York,2020-12-20,z-StPl7bNTA,"the vaccine. It's a very important thing to be able to do. We're going to have to do a lot of things. Good evening. I'm Ali Balman in for Jessica Moore. Moderna's coronavirus vaccine is now on the way to health care providers in all 50 states. It comes as cases across the nation, including here in the tri-state area, continue to rise. CBS2's Nick Callaway reports. Cheers, ring out as the second coronavirus vaccine leaves the warehouse. In route to health care providers across the nation. The FDA authorized Moderna's vaccine to join Pfizer's shot in the fight against the virus, offering a glimmer of hope amid a surge in cases and hospitalizations. And after more than 316 thousand people have died in the US. Still, millions are defying the guidance of health officials and traveling for the holidays. For many, it's worth it to make it home for Christmas. So we're coming back to Jersey for Christmas. My brother. Family. That's it. Family. The TSA says more than a million people were screened at airports across the US on Saturday. The TSA says more than a million people were screened at airports across the US on Saturday. The TSA says more than a million people were screened at airports across the US on Saturday. Marking the second busiest day at airports since March. And AAA forecast as many as 84 million people may travel this week. Travelers we talk to say they feel safe catching a flight. I don't have a problem flying. I mean, you know, you look at the stats about people flying, people getting infected from flights is so low. Delta is doing such a great job cleaning the airplanes. I don't know, problem work. We're just going to take our precautions when we're there in French, just singly we do in Connecticut. So, we're going to take our precautions when we are there in French, just singly we do in Connecticut. So, I'm just not overly concerned. In New York police are busy cracking down on illegal clubs that are violating COVID restrictions. The New York City Sheriff shut down this party in Rosedale, Queens, which was accessed through a rear alley. More than 160 people were partying here. Five organizers were charged with violating emergency orders among other crimes. Nick Calloway, CBS2 News. We'll be getting tomorrow residents and staffers at nursing homes across New York will be getting the COVID-19 vaccine. A federal advisory panel also recommended that people 75 and older and essential workers should be next in line for the vaccine.

Canada Becomes Second Country to Approve Moderna's Covid-19 Vaccine,Bloomberg Quicktake,2020-12-23,Y-ewTFoUt3c,"Canada is set to extend its ban on incoming flights from the UK until at least January 6th. The country has also become just the second country to approve the Moderna vaccine, coming two weeks after authorizing immunizations with the Pfizer chat."
Australia provisionally approves Moderna vaccine while half the country remains under lockdown,South China Morning Post,2021-08-09,ZFk-OnoWBA0,"distances here in California, the Lagos of the Caribbean States participating in the first vlog, the whole dynamic of Rio Grande newsletter. Well, I hope you Australians are frustrating. I know this sick of it. I know they're angry and I know what they wanted to stop and for life to get back to where they knew it. But what we have to do now is recognize the reality of the challenge we have in front of us. None of us likes it. None of us likes to have restrictions. None of us likes to have the situation we're having now. And I can understand that Australians will go, well you're the Prime Minister or you're the Premier or you're the government. We don't want it to be this way. Believe me, I get it. I don't want it to be this way either. I don't want it to be like this for you and your family. I don't want it to be like that for your kids who I know you want to go to school. I want my kids to go to school too. We all want that. But there are no shortcuts here. Delta has made it clear of this virus that we have to get through the suppression phase and keep it at bay as best as we can. The epicenter of the virus in New South Wales and Sydney still remains the Canada Banks Turn local government area. We are seeing some stabilisation in other local government areas. But that local government area is proving to demonstrate the virus is still circulating. And we also ask people in those are joining local or suburbs I should say. And those are joining suburbs to the Canada Banks Turn local government area to especially be on high alert. That remains the greatest challenge for us."
Pfizer or Moderna - which is more effective as a COVID-19 booster shot? Findings from an MOH study,CNA,2021-11-15,kPewSoG8BV8,"We have been reporting that 85% of our population has been fully vaccinated. I've been receiving many queries about why our vaccine coverage appears to be lower than the reported figures in some other countries. The reason is that some countries report vaccine coverage against the eligible population, whereas we report against the total population. If we break down some 85% of the population fully vaccinated, there's a remaining 15%, and if we break down the remaining 15% not vaccinated, it comprises as follows: 1% who are not living in Singapore, 9% who are children below 12 and not eligible, and the remaining 5% who are eligible but chose not to vaccinate. So if we recalculate this based on the eligible population, we are around 94% vaccinated. It is one of the highest coverages in the world. MOH will provide both figures henceforth in our daily press release to give a fuller picture of the progress of our vaccination exercise. Some members of the public have also asked MOH about the choice of boosters. Specifically, after taking two shots of the mRNA vaccine, should they now take Pfizer-BioNTech, or should they take Moderna? As the Expert Committee EC19V has recommended, the two mRNA vaccines can be used interchangeably, regardless of whether the first two doses were Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna. MOH has done a study recently on the relative effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna as booster shots in terms of reducing infection risk. We compared two combinations: one combination is PPP, meaning Pfizer-BioNTech for all three doses, versus PPM, meaning Pfizer-BioNTech for the first two doses, then Moderna for the booster, like what I have done and what DMS has done. There are results for other combinations such as MMM and MMP, but I should caution that the sample sizes for these are not very large and the statistics may not be as meaningful. Just comparing PPP and PPM, the results are as follows: relative to two Pfizer-BioNTech doses, PPP further reduces the risk of infection by 62%, and for PPM, the reduction is 72%. So both mRNA vaccines work very well as boosters, with PPM having a slight edge. Regardless, the impact on the reduction of the severity of illness is extremely high for both combinations. There has also been a lot of interest from parents on children's vaccines. MOH has signed a new supply agreement with Pfizer, which includes deliveries of pediatric vaccines, and we are in constant contact with Pfizer, who will try to fulfill the deliveries as soon as possible. In the meantime, our own children's vaccination trial is making progress. The purpose of this trial is to smoothen operations when we have to do it at scale because young children are involved. KK Hospital is overseeing it and planning to start recruitment of the first batch of participants. So if your child is between 5 and 11 years old, you can find out from the KKH's website and Facebook page more about the study as well as the registration, and this will be available by the end of this week."
Vaccine Misinformation Widespread On Social Media,NBC News,2021-07-21,yhsLob344MY,"tonight. Anti vaccine groups are trying to stop Facebook from removing their posts by using code words and fake profile names related to dance like in these posts dancing folks are vaccinated people. Vaccine is hoki pokey or beer while Facebook says it's working hard to fight misinformation removing 18 million COVID-19 falsehood so far. This new tactic could make that tougher, which could impact people like sisters, Nada and Hannah Alhazh who get their information from social media and other sources and don't agree on the vaccine. I am a bit skeptical. I don't really trust the government too much when you hear your sister say these things. How do you feel? I think it makes me sad. The vaccine is something I think everyone should get to help prevent other people from getting sick. Some families have joined online support groups to help with conversations about misinformation, including this group with more than 150,000 members. Psychologists, Sandra Vanderland and studies the effect of misinformation on social media. How does social media influence people's relationship with facts when people receive most of their information about COVID-19 and vaccination from social media. They're more likely to be misinformed and they're less likely to get vaccinated. A survey shows 53 percent of Americans get their news from social media as for the Alhazh sisters, they no longer talk about the vaccine. We make our own choices. Experts say when talking about a tough topic, find common ground. For example, affirm people have concerns about the vaccine's side effects. Then pivot toward evidence about its safety and effectiveness. Finally, allow that person to make their own choice. Thank you."
How social media has impacted COVID-19 vaccine misinformation,CTV News,2021-07-17,iHUT1CtxB8E,"I want to bring in infectious diseases, professor and outbreak response expert Dr. Eileen Marty. She joins me from Miami Beach, Florida. Dr. Marty, thanks for joining us this morning. Always a pleasure. All right, so cases are up 70 percent this past week and hospitalizations up by 26 percent. What's your reaction to these numbers? Well, those are the national averages here in Florida. It's even worse. Our numbers have really skyrocketed and our hospitals are, again, experiencing very significant numbers of individuals. We're up by 67 percent in our hospitalization rates. So what I think, I think that it's incredibly sad that we have such a phenomenal tool, the vaccine, and that there's so many people who have elected not to take it because we have ample vaccine to give to everyone. So yes, it's almost exclusively unvaccinated people that are having to hospitalize. There are a few instances of vaccine breakthrough with very rare instances where we have to hospitalize someone who was vaccinated, but the overwhelming majority are these unvaccinated individuals. Yeah, and you kind of touch on my next question because the CDC says the pandemic is the pandemic of the unvaccinated right now. So what do you think needs to be done to get people who are unvaccinated to get vaccinated because they've tried everything from a lot of ways to getting social media stars to come out and say something? What needs to be done to get people to that next step? I think that probably what really has to happen is they have to hear it from individuals that they trust. And it behooves all of us in the medical community to have town halls and sessions where people can express their fears and that we can provide them solid information as to why vaccines are such a good way to go and such an additional help. And I think it's very important that people realize that as these numbers go up and we have more and more virus once again spreading in our community, it leads this snowball into problems. And to the point that even a vaccinated person's protection from the vaccine can be overwhelmed by high enough bolus of virus as could happen, for example, in a crowded indoor space with no one wearing masks that's poorly ventilated. And that's when we start to see even vaccine breakthrough because vaccines are our best weapon against this virus but even our best measures has holes. And so that's why we layer our protections. So right now while we're seeing these numbers go up, remember it impacts directly on the individual affected, on their families, on the community, and ultimately on the economy as well, we have got to get this under control and it is absolutely tragic that there is so much misinformation about vaccines on the way. Yeah, and let's talk about that misinformation because this week, President Biden slammed social media companies saying misinformation is literally killing people. So how much of a role does vaccine misinformation playing in the rise in the cases and hospitalizations? Well, I actually am more offended by established media organizations promoting falsehoods than even the social media promoting falsehoods because none of it should be accepted. People need to understand and distinguish between a reliable source and people who are frankly lying to them and leading them literally to their death. Yeah, and so sad because it seems that we're not fighting a virus but misinformation instead which is very unfortunate. All right, well, thank you so much for that. That is infectious diseases, professor and outbreak response expert Dr. Eileen Marty. Thanks again for your time this morning. Pleasure, thank you."
Covid-19 Vaccine Misinformation Spread on Social Media,Bloomberg Technology,2021-04-01,AVwg9xhNzx0,"Sarah, the story was absolutely fascinating. Let's start at the high level. Why have anti-vaxxers picked women as a target? Well, it's really because it worked the last time. Women have been the target of anti-vaxxers going back quite some time because really the conversation before COVID-19 was about mothers and their babies with the MMR, measles, et cetera. And so what the anti-vaxxers had their strategy at this time was really just to put COVID in front of a vaccine and use the same playbook that they'd used previously because it worked just that well. And that's what we're seeing right now. And it's resonating among so many women that Sarah Fryer and I talked to for this piece. What did the women tell you? Because I understand you got a lot of different reasons from women who weren't getting the vaccine. And of course, the possibility of not being able to have a child was high on that list. Yeah, so we heard the gambit, really. I think that the most prevalent one was really around safety. So people took an exception to how quickly the vaccine was produced, how they wanted to wait and see, really. And that's vaccine hesitancy almost as a definition. And so that was a really big chunk. The fertility part was very interesting as well. And a lot of that stemmed from a blog that actually showed up on social media in early December of last year. And that blog claimed wrongly that the vaccine inhibits women's fertility. And that really found itself all over the social platforms. And that was just weeks before the emergency authorization was issued that allowed this vaccine to be given right at first to nurses and first responders. And it was a lot of those nurses that we talked to right at first. We went into nursing Facebook groups. We went online and we saw the conversations that they were having and nursing as a profession skews very female. And that's really what they were talking about was questions about, well, if I'm trying to become pregnant or if I'm pregnant already, should I just wait? And that's vaccine hesitancy. And I just want to add that there is no evidence that the vaccine has a negative effect on women or pregnant women or can harm a woman's fertility. In your view, just as an observer, how are Facebook and Instagram responsible? Are they responsible for how this has proliferated on their platforms? So they are certainly trying at this point. But their algorithms, their business model, what they try to do is they try to reward really engaging posts. And that's what drives what you see on the platform. And we know just because of how we've studied disinformation over all these years, that lies really do spread faster than the truth. It is more interesting, more titillating a lot of times. We saw this with, when this fertility blog went out, Pfizer did come back with an answer to this question, doesn't affect fertility. And they gave a very robust scientific answer, full of scientific jargon, that we reference in the piece. And it's hard for that type of language to really resonate on social media. We say that the people who are giving the information have to do a little bit better. They have to live in this world where social media memes, that's what spreads. And the scientific community and the companies, they hadn't quite caught onto that yet."
President Joe Biden on social media vaccine disinformation: They're killing people,CNBC Television,2021-07-16,JS6Aw-hM190,"Biden slamming the social media platforms NBC's Peter Alexander asked the president what his message is to platforms like Facebook on their handling of COVID disinformation. The killing people. I mean, it really, well, look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated and that's in their killing people. Facebook responding in a statement saying, what we've partnered with government experts, health authorities and researchers to take aggressive action against misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines to protect public health. So far, we've removed more than 18 million pieces of COVID misinformation, removed accounts that repeatedly break these rules, and connected more than two billion people to reliable information about COVID-19 and COVID vaccines across our apps. Now, the White House is taking an increasingly aggressive stance, saying that Facebook's efforts to stop vaccine misinformation are inadequate."
Why US anti-vaxxers will refuse the coronavirus vaccine,The Guardian,2020-05-29,HFHBPvMRvX4,"Here is Bob the Shouts! Anti-vaxxers. I'd heard of them, but a lot of what I knew was limited to the loud protests, the signs, the shouting. Until fairly recently, the anti-vaxx movement was sidelined, maybe treated as a bit of a novelty. Then, in 2019, people refusing vaccines contributed to the worst measles outbreak in a generation. Now, with coronavirus, things have gotten more serious. Anti-vaxxers aren't on the fringe anymore. In the past two months, they've been a vocal presence at protests across the US. And in May, polling found that one in four Americans may refuse a coronavirus vaccine. I want to find out what anti-vaxxers believe, or more importantly, what they don't believe. Why are they so resistant to the overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccines are safe? I will absolutely refuse to take a coronavirus vaccine. Alana Newman is the organizer of the Health Freedom Summit, an online event that brought together dozens of vaccine skeptics and activists in April. They're going to be dropping actual unsensored facts on how you beat the virus, including all future mutations. Like other anti-vaxxers, Newman just doesn't believe the scientists and health organizations who save vaccines are safe. Are you concerned about a potential coronavirus vaccine? People are free to do what they want, but I will fight for my right to not be injected with something I don't trust at all. Who do you trust around this? I trust. That's a good question. I trust myself. I'm learning to be self-reliant, and I ask as many people as I possibly can what their opinion is, and then I assemble what sounds reasonable to myself. We're making people fearful of these diseases like coronavirus, like measles, and then that's when you get people to buy your drug. So you set up a problem, and then you get to sell people the solution. Some of the people Newman does trust, those who spoke at her freedom summit, have been widely discredited, and their theories disproven. Andrew Wakefield gained notoriety after claiming vaccines cause autism, but that was disproven. Andrew Wakefield, the man these people see as a hero, was guilty of serious ethical breaches, dishonesty, and in one instance, a callous disregard for the distress and pain caused to children in his care. Another speaker was Judy Micavitz. Micavitz was already known in anti-vaxxers circles. The pharmaceutical companies are given a free ride on injecting toxins in your children without a single safety study. But she sprung to further prominence in May when she appeared in pandemic, an online conspiracy theory video that got 8 million views before YouTube took it down. According to Micavitz, the creation of the virus is part of a global conspiracy. And do you have any ideas of where this occurred? Oh yeah, I'm sure it occurred between the North Carolina Laboratories, Fort DeTrick, the US Army Research Institute of Infectious Disease, and the Wilhelm Laboratory. Let's take a look at some of Micavitz's other claims. The flu vaccine increases our persons odds of getting the coronavirus. Coronavirus is activated by face masks. A mandatory vaccine will kill millions. There is no scientific evidence for any of this. Micavitz also believes hydroxychloroquine is effective against the virus. There's no evidence for this, but she's not the only one who believes it. It's kind of her lot of good stories. So why are so many people drawn to conspiratorial thinking? Jopie Eris, a professor of psychiatry who's written extensively about the topic. First of all, they're just very entertaining. Many Hollywood movies or TV shows are based on conspiracy theories. We control the disease by controlling the information. You can't protect the public by lying to them. People who are attracted to conspiracy theories often feel like they've stumbled upon some seek of reality that the rest of us sheep or sheeple, as conspiracy theorists like to refer to us as, don't know about it. There's a certain sense of feeling special. I think the other big emotional need is psychological needs for closure, certainty, and control. This idea that things happen for some higher cause or some higher ultimate purpose. Whether we're talking about the assassination of JFK or 9-11, or with COVID-19, we're still learning on a day-to-day basis what that disease is, how it manifests, how to best treat it, and to a certain extent, conspiracy theories offer a framework to explain why these events are happening. Social media plays a huge part too. Facebook groups and pages serve to reinforce skepticism about vaccines. But this isn't necessarily an organic uprising. Anti-vaccine groups, including one led by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., nephew of JFK, have been paid for anti-vaccine Facebook ads, often branding them with the ideas of patriotism, an individual freedom. Dr. Sard Oma, an epidemiologist at Yale University, said these ideas often go hand in hand with anti-vax theories, which he stressed are not rooted in science. They're incredibly safe. So there's no absolute safety in anything in life. So it's some of the most benign things can have side effects. But the risk-benefit ratio is not even close for the vaccines that are routinely recommended. It's absolutely reasonable for people to ask questions and have questions and come to their physicians about things that they think that they worry them. But also the part of personal responsibility is not to go into these outlandish theories. Not only these people are taking a decision on their own behalf, they're taking a decision on everyone else's behalf as well. I'm going to fight for my rights and not have to be forced to take that. For my children's rights and not be forced to take that. There's 10,000 infectious diseases out there. Are we going to take a vaccine for every single one of them? I don't know, but I know if there is a vaccine for a preventable illness, surely it makes sense to, you know, you must agree, surely it makes sense to take that and prevent people from getting sick. You can do a lot to create health in your body so that you can be strong against any virus that comes your way. Conspiracy thinking in America is no longer on the fringes. And while there isn't really any harm in someone thinking Neil Armstrong didn't land on the moon or that the earth is flat, this is different. Fueled by social media and big donors and aided by a suspicion of experts and notions of individual liberty, the anti-vax movement seems set to grow. And with his own weariness of mainstream science and a disregard for facts, Donald Trump has contributed to a climate where these ideas can flourish. That's something that could be very dangerous for America and the rest of the world."
How American conservatives turned against the vaccine,Vox,2022-02-23,sv0dQfRRrEQ,"We're entering the third year of the pandemic, and in the US, the loss of life, month by month, for two years, looks like this. Altogether, more than 900,000 people have died. But there really are two pandemics here because starting in the spring of 2021, the distribution of the vaccines dramatically changed the nature of the pandemic. If we look closer at the Delta Wave and the beginning of Omicron, we see that the deaths of unvaccinated people were much higher than vaccinated people. This data comes from a subset of US states and cities that provide immunization data. While the Delta Wave did kill some vaccinated people, the risk was 15 times higher if you were unvaccinated. Philly Barrett was one of those unvaccinated people, and he started going live on his Facebook page from the hospital. I just love you guys. I'm able to talk today. Today's been a great day. In one of the videos, he recommends to his friends and family that they get the vaccine. Do you think that that was a hard thing for him to say? Yes. Because that's not what he had been communicating a lot, you know, prior to that. But I think that he would want me to communicate what I know he wanted. He would want me to introduce him to you. He would ask you to look at his situation and realize that you could possibly get the severe COVID like he did, and be fighting for your life, and then have a lot of regrets that you didn't have the vaccine at that time. You know, I was one of those that said there kind of is more in the political side with COVID and all. And the other side. Now when it comes to the political breakdown on vaccinations, there are two things to know. One is that a majority of Republicans are vaccinated with at least one dose, according to the most recent survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The second thing to know is that most unvaccinated Americans are Republican. So the question is how does that affect the balance of lives lost? Well, we can plot the states directly by their 2020 election results with the red states on the right and the blue states on the left. And we can look at their death rates since April 2021, and it's pretty striking. The Republican states were suffering much bigger losses. And I want to stress that this relationship wasn't there before the vaccines. This is the same chart, but it shows death rates before April 2021. And they're much more spread out with COVID hitting blue states as hard as red ones. So what I want to understand is the series of events that took us from this to this. The Democrats are in a full court freak out over coronavirus after Ted Cruz self-isolated after coming into kind. Valentine was my younger brother, a very accomplished radio entertainment personality. New York Times even called it the Trump virus. Can you imagine if the Ebola virus had been called the Obama virus? He was on air in July. And you can hear him kind of talking through the symptoms. This is my COVID saga. And yesterday was probably my worst day. Just the shaking and the chills. Really processing things on air. I told you I'm not judging anybody either way. If you want to get the vaccine, it's a personal health decision. I made the decision that I probably wouldn't die from it. A Phil would like for his listeners to know that he regrets not being more vehemently pro-vaccine. He is in the hospital in the critical care unit. He said, you know, I got it wrong. And then we went for bad worse. We know how it all ended. We're all very sad right now at the passing of a friend and a colleague. And our thoughts and prayers go out to Susan and the boys at the tremendous loss. Had he been opposed to other types of vaccines in the past, where his kids vaccinated with the school vaccines? He wasn't against anything else. It's not obvious that Republicans would be more vaccine hesitant. Similar percentages of Democrats and Republicans said that they get the flu shot every year, according to a May 2020 poll. And in 2019, the Pew Research Center found that nearly identical shares of Republicans and Democrats said that the benefits of vaccinating kids from measles, mumps, and rubella outweigh the risks. Republicans were slightly less likely to say they should be required. But it's nothing like the 30-point gap that we see in COVID vaccination rates today. One way to understand that gap is to consider the vastly different information environments that Republicans and Democrats live in. This is a list of new sources trusted by at least 40 percent of Democrats, according to a 2019 survey by Pew. The COVID variant was first released data from the centers. And here's a list of new sources trusted by at least 40 percent of Republicans. What this means is that American conservatives are quite exposed to the editorial choices of a single network. And on vaccine coverage, that network's choices have been confusing. It's a great vaccine. It's a safe vaccine. It is something that can keep you out of the hospital. How many people have been killed or injured by the COVID vaccines? Does anyone know the answer? If your doctor says you're okay for it, get it. It will save your life. I got my second dose. I got a horrific pain in my right eye. The vaccine is still working. It's still protecting you and those around you. Why should you penalize people for not taking a vaccine? Which doesn't work. The mRNA COVID vaccines need to be withdrawn from the market now. No one should get them. No one should get boosted. No one should get double boosted. If we compare the information sources of those who said they definitely get vaccinated with the information sources of those who said they would definitely not get vaccinated, we see that the vaccine resistors were less likely to consume most news sources. Except for two. Fox News and social media. For 18 hours, I laid in bed dealing with my mortality and not knowing which way that was going to go. And I'm laying in bed going, this is my fault. I should have been listening to doctors and nurses and medical professionals instead of my political algorithms. And so is it mostly Facebook where you were getting sort of these messages? Yes, I saw some of Fox News reports online. But 95 percent of what I got was through my algorithms and friends on Facebook. And I can tell you, when I started telling people you need to consider this vaccine and you need to stop politicizing this, I lost a lot of friends in the more hardcore you were. I had some really ugly things said to me and I had to start blocking people that I've been friends with for years. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that 64 percent of unvaccinated people believed at least four or more pieces of COVID misinformation of the eight that they tested. And they found that among those who trusted conservative news outlets, belief and misinformation was more common than among those who trusted other sources. But we have to remember that this is a correlation. We don't know if antivax content on TV and Facebook caused people to turn against the vaccine or if it was simply pandering to people who had already made up their mind. It was probably both. See, one thing I didn't mention about this chart is that this data is actually from January 2021. So most of the antivax content on these platforms hadn't been published. So I went back and searched for the earliest polling I could find. This is from May of 2020 and it asked people if they would get a hypothetical coronavirus vaccine. 40 percent of Republicans said definitely not or probably not. And that's pretty much where Republicans are at today 20 months later. So what explains why a big chunk of Republican voters had already turned against the vaccine? Six months before the presidential election and nearly a whole year before the vaccines were even available. I think the answer is somewhere in here. Of the eight false claims pulled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the one most widely believed wasn't about vaccines at all. And so of the different pieces of misinformation we tested, the most commonly believed overall and particularly by Republicans was this idea that the government was inflating the number of deaths due to COVID-19. Top US health officials are rejecting President Trump's suggestion that the US coronavirus case and death totals are fake news. You said a couple of hours ago the number of cases and deaths of the China virus are quote far exaggerated. That claim was based on a misunderstanding of how death certificates work but it was extremely potent. If you've been told you can't trust the death count, how do you assess your own risk? And why would you take action to protect yourself and your family? If we compare unvaccinated Republicans with their vaccinated counterparts, the biggest difference between them isn't that the unvaccinated ones are younger or more conservative or more rural, although they are. It's the pervasiveness of the belief that the seriousness of the coronavirus is generally exaggerated. And that idea that the pandemic has been made into a bigger deal than it really is, has been an overarching belief for our majority of Republicans. Even as COVID became one of the leading causes of death in the US, even as the virus shifted from cities to rural America. And that takes us back to the very first weeks of the pandemic, when the virus found a United States under an exceptionally polarizing president, and at the start of an election year. We have it under control, it's going to be just fine. Do Biden calling him the worst possible person to lead our country through the virus? Well, he pretty much shut it down, coming in from China. And President Trump has no plan, no origin, no understanding of the fact. The coronavirus ends up having a real impact on the economy, it could tip the election to the Democrats. Democrats and their media cronies have decided to weaponize fear to improve their chances against Trump in November. In the early stages of the pandemic, you got this very large polarization around things like lockdowns, mass querying, and the severity of the pandemic itself, just how seriously to take this. Trump supported anti-lockdown protests. Liberate Minnesota, Michigan, and Virginia. Days led by Democratic governors. President Trump without a mask. Defiance in the face of his varsity. Joe Biden wearing one. An image of trepidation, even fear. Making for a split-screen campaign moment. And it seems that the rain can fall Republicans largely on their own figured out that if you don't take the pandemic seriously, why would you get vaccinated? You know, like people telling you to do it, they're not trustworthy. And so, you know, flash forward a spring of 2021, and you get this weird paradox, where most Republican politicians are vaccinated. But they're saying stuff at the same time to cater to anti-vaccine sentiment in their base. Now there's real political downside to promoting vaccination for a lot of these folks. You're free to do what you have to do, but I recommend taking the vaccines. I did it. It's good. Take the vaccines. But you got, no, that's okay. That's all right. You got your freedoms. Let me tell you how I make sense of what happened to your brother, and I want to get your reaction. I see Phil looking at the data, concluding that his risk of dying from COVID was low. But I think his brain was sort of pushed in the direction of that conclusion by signals that were sent really early on in the pandemic, by Trump and Fox and others that Republicans kind of think this coronavirus is overblown. The polarization starts there. Then by the time the vaccines come out, Phil's not getting clear consistent signals from the people that he trusts, that it's time to update his risk calculation and go ahead and get that vaccine. And then he gets hit by the beginning of the Delta wave. Does that seem accurate to you? It's on the right track. I think that the calculus changed when the Delta variant presented itself because it attacked a much younger segment of the population. Then all of a sudden, politics starts to enter into the thing. We had already, we had just come off of being lied to for three years straight that Trump was the Russian agent, a traitor to the country. So I think that people looked at scants at that whole messaging system. The underlying problem is that there are two diametrically opposed views of what America should be like in this world. And one is held by one side and one is held by the other. So you decide which one you're going to be on. You get into this situation where elite politicians in the respective parties feel like they have to polarize on the issue because their base expects them to disagree with the other party, it would have helped a great deal. The elites of the political leaders of our country coordinate across party lines and laid out a unified message at the beginning. I definitely think we could have largely mitigated the polarized responses that we saw in the mass public. What do you hope for? What do you fear when it comes to polarization around public health issues? One of the things I really worry about going forward is what we'd like is reduced polarization around COVID vaccination, especially as we move into a possible regular regime of boosting, going forward. But what I think might be more likely, if we aren't really, really effective and proactive on reducing that polarization, is that polarization around COVID vaccination persists and spreads to other vaccines like measles, moms, rubella. And sure enough, researchers at UC San Diego tracked vaccine attitudes from March to August in 2021. And they found that not only were the Republicans in their study more likely to turn against the COVID vaccine as the year went on, they also ended up with declining attitudes about vaccines in general and lower intentions to get the flu shot next year. Which means that the health consequences of pandemic polarization could extend well beyond COVID-19. Thank you."
Novak Djokovic breaks silence over Covid vaccine refusal - BBC News,BBC News,2022-02-15,rNaIMC4XMhc,"Have you received any vaccination against COVID? I have not. Why? I understand that N support fully the freedom to choose, you know, whether you want to get vaccinated or not. And I have not spoken about this before and I have not disclosed my medical record and my vaccination status because I had the right to keep that private and discreet. But as I see there is a lot of wrong conclusions and assumptions out there. I think it is important to speak up about that and justify certain things. So I was never against vaccination. And I understand that globally everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus and seeing a hopefully an end soon to this virus. And vaccination is probably the biggest effort that was made probably half of the planet was vaccinated. And I fully respect that. But I have always represented and always supported the freedom to choose what you put into your body. For me that is essential. It is really the principle of understanding what is right and what is wrong for you. And me as an elite professional athlete, I have always carefully reviewed, assessed everything that comes in from the supplements, food, the water that I drink or sports drinks. Anything really that comes into my body as a fuel based on all the information that I got I decided not to take the vaccine as of today. So do you have as of today? Yes. I keep my mind open because we are all trying to find collectively a best possible solution to end COVID. No one really wants to be in this kind of situation that we have been in collectively for two years. I am part of the sport, the very global sport that is played every single week in a different location. So I understand the consequences of my decision. And one of the consequences of my decision was not going to Australia and I was prepared not to go. And I understand that not being vaccinated today, I am unable to travel to most of the tournaments at the moment. And that is a price you are willing to pay. That is the price that I am willing to pay. Ultimately, are you prepared to forego the chance to be the greatest player that ever picked up a racket, statistically? Because you feel so strongly about this jab? Yes. I do. But as things stand, if this means that you miss the French open, is that price you will be willing to pay? Yes. That is the price that I am willing to pay. And if it means that you miss Wimbledon this year, again that is the price you are willing to pay. Yes. Why? No fact. Why? Why? Because the principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else. I am trying to be in tune with my body as much as I possibly can. What do you say directly to anti-vaccination campaigners around the world who proudly declare Novak Chokovic is one of us? I say that everyone has the right to choose to act or say whatever they feel is appropriate for them. And I have never said that I am part of that movement. You know, no one in the whole process during Australian saga has asked me on my stance or on my opinion on vaccination. No one. I could not really express what I feel and where my stance is neither in the legal process, neither outside. So it is really unfortunate that there has been this kind of misconception and wrong conclusion that has been made around the world based upon something that I completely disagree with. You"
Debunking COVID-19 vaccine myths,Mayo Clinic,2022-01-10,_cWYdCRxWL8,"There was fast track in the execution of the clinical trials, and I think it's very important to know what parts were fast tracked and which parts were not. So the fast track part were regulatory approvals, funding, data analysis, and submission to the FDA. Those are all paperwork items. What was not fast tracked was enrollment of patients, clinical follow-up of these patients, capturing the events which occurred and the follow-up. So these trials were executed very, very well. For the people who think that they've had COVID and they don't need the vaccine, for them I would say that you would still want to get the vaccine because it's going to give you long term protection. For the people who are young and healthy who think that I'm not going to get severe COVID, I'm not going to die from it. From them, I want it for them, I want to say they should get the vaccine yes to protect themselves because even young people can get severely ill. But more so for your community, for your friends, for your family, for your country, I would encourage every person to go out and seek your COVID-19 vaccine so that we can all get back to our lives again. And those symptoms include things like having muscle aches, having chills, having a headache, feeling tired. These are symptoms that people are very likely to experience after these vaccines for up to two, sometimes up to five days at most. They're not harmful, but they will be concerning to people if they're not expecting them. The COVID-19 vaccine is extremely safe for our children. We have a number of studies that represent that. We've had a number of children already received the vaccines and have been able to monitor those children closely. And we feel very confident this is a safe and effective vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine in a lot of ways is no different than our other vaccines we have available. It's administered in the same way, either in the arm or in the leg depending on the age of the child. The doses are appropriate for the age of the child as well. There's no special fall-up that has to happen after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. And our side effects are quite similar to other vaccines, including fever, muscle aches, but most likely pain, redness, and swelling at the injection sites."
Vaccine facts  Covid 19 vaccines and Christianity,Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust,2021-05-07,quhe30b6H2U,"My name is Briannie Franklin. I'm executive lead pharmacist for research at the chest and an ordained priest within the Church of England. If you're a Christian, you may be wondering if having one of the COVID-19 vaccines is compatible with your faith. Christian leaders have been really clear that having the vaccine is not only allowed by Christianity, but can be a very Christian thing to do. As well as leaders in the Church of England, the vaccination programme is supported by many others, including the E-Lim network of Pentecostal churches, the Baptist Church and the Vignade network. As head of the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope has also said that ethically everyone should receive the vaccine, if they're eligible to do so. Some Christians may wonder if they should trust their faith to God, rather than relying on a vaccine. But the view of most Church leaders is that God has given us the science that has helped to develop these vaccines. So for many of us, the vaccines are a real answer to our prayers. As Christians, we're called to love our neighbour. It's not always easy to find ways to do that. But having the vaccine is one really practical way you can love your neighbour. Having the vaccine will help you and your family, reducing the risk of you becoming ill with COVID-19, a virus that can be deadly. But by having the vaccine, you are also protecting others, including those who are more vulnerable than yourself. What could be a better way of putting your Christian faith into practice?"
13 Year Old Boy Dies 3 Days After COVID Vaccine | Post Vaccine Deaths,Doctor Mike Hansen,2021-06-29,-3EBnIsDqao,"Welcome to another video for those of you who don't know me, my name is Dr. Mike Hansen, and in this video I'm going to be talking about a 13 year old boy in Michigan who died three days after getting the Pfizer vaccine. The cause of death is being investigated by the CDC, and according to the patient's aunt on Twitter, the preliminary autopsy report showed that he had fluid around his heart. So what caused his death? Before I tell you my thoughts on that, it first helps to understand what the background on what myocarditis is. It's inflammation of the heart muscle. And pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardial sac. That's where the heart sits in there. Sometimes pericarditis can cause fluids of build up within the sac, but around the heart muscle. And this is called a pericardial effusion. The first reports of myocarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that involved US military patients and patients from Israel, the Israeli cohort identified a male predominance with an incidence of one out of every 20,000 men aged 18 to 30. We know that the COVID vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna can cause it, but actual COVID infection is a much more common cause. The CDC has received 1226 preliminary reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following about 300 million total doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Myocarditis is most common in the ages of 12 to 30 and it's more common in boys. Among people 12 and older, there are 267 reports of heart inflammation, meaning myocarditis, after one dose of vaccine and 827 after the second dose and 132 after an unknown dose. So overall, the number of cases of myocarditis related to the COVID mRNA vaccines is very low. And for those who do get it, it's usually a small amount of heart inflammation that lasts for about a week or so requiring minimal treatment. In fact, not only is myocarditis way more common from COVID, the risks to the heart from infection can be more severe. Take a look at this ultrasound of the heart, aka an echocardiogram. This is of a young patient with COVID myocarditis. This is a poorly pumping heart. This is why the CDC still recommends vaccination for those 12 and older. Now there's three recent studies that came out that looked at specific cases of myocarditis that developed after getting the COVID mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna. In the first study in the journal Pediatrics, they reported on seven cases of myocarditis from the Pfizer vaccine. All the patients were seven otherwise healthy male teenagers. All of them test the negative for COVID. None of the patients met criteria for multi-system inflammatory syndrome and children or MISC. All had an elevated trapponin level. Trapponin is a protein in heart muscle cells and whenever there's heart tissue damage, as occurs with either a heart attack or inflammation of the heart, that trapponin ends up being leaked into the bloodstream. The higher the trapponin, the more heart tissue damage. An echocardiogram, which is great for looking at how the heart is functioning, was normal in all but one patient. Cardiac MRI, which is especially great for looking at detailed structure of the heart, especially when looking for heart inflammation, showed myocarditis in all of the patients. Three patients received nothing more than NSAIDs, meaning non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. This includes things like ibuprofen or the more powerful tortal aka ketrolac. These drugs not only help to suppress inflammation or fight inflammation, but they also help to alleviate pain. Four patients received IVIG, meaning intravenous immunoglobulin, and they received steroids in all of them had their symptoms resolved, and less than a week. For the one who did have an abnormal echocardiogram, let's take a closer look at his case. So he's a 14-year-old, previously healthy male who gets the Pfizer vaccine. One day later, he develops a temp of 30.3 celsius, and one day after that starts getting shorter breath, and he has pleuritic chest pain. Pleuritic chest pain, meaning it hurts more when he takes a deep breath, or hurts more if you cough or sneeze. So he goes to an urgent care clinic, EKG shows ST segment elevation. ST elevation can mean a lot of different things depending on the clinical context. Sometimes it means there's a heart attack. Sometimes it happens with myocarditis, and then sometimes it happens with pericarditis, especially when you see it in most of the leads. And that's what he had. And his ultrasound showed mildly depressed, left and right ventricular systolic function, meaning his left ventricle and his right ventricle weren't pumping quite as strong. Also, he had an elevated chuponin eye level of 22.1 NG per ml, which normal range for that hospital was noted to be less than 0.045 NG per ml. Now in hospital day three, cardiac MRI showed some areas of heart muscle swelling, meaning edema, as well as some areas of scarring. He was treated with NSAIDs. First, it was Tordal later with Naproxin. He was also treated with a diuretic called LASIX-AKF-DeroSomide. They later repeated the echocardiogram, which showed improvement, and he was discharged from the hospital after four days. On follow-up 13 days later, he appeared well, but he did have chest pain with exertion, despite instructions to avoid strenuous exercise. Now in EKG showed non-specific changes at that time, and a third echocardiogram was also done at that time, which was back to normal. So overall, the seven cases of COVID vaccine myocarditis in this study had good outcomes. Then there is this study, which had eight patients that were hospitalized with chest pain within two to four days of receiving either the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine. All of them were otherwise healthy males between the ages of 21 and 56, so older, age range in this group. All but one patient developed symptoms after their second dose. Most had chest pain within a day or two of the vaccine, and all had elevated chuponal levels, and myocarditis seen on cardiac MRI. Two of them had slight reduction in their heart function. One of them did undergo a heart biopsy, and the pathology results didn't show any abnormality. All patients had resolution of their chest pain, and they were discharged from the hospital in stable condition. Then there was this study that involved seven patients hospitalized for acute myocarditis-like illness following COVID vaccination. All were men less than 40 years old. Six patients received the mRNA vaccine, either Moderna or Pfizer, and then one received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. All the patients presented within three to seven days after they got the vaccine. They all had acute onset of chest pain, and it was basically more of the same as the other patients that we just talked about. The one patient in this study that did have a heart biopsy done, it didn't show any evidence of myocarditis when they did the pathology study. Now, although the heart biopsy was normal, that doesn't necessarily mean that there wasn't myocarditis present in a different part of the heart, because trying to hit that right spot is like throwing darts blindfolded. When doing an autopsy, though, this changes because you can look at essentially the entire heart underneath the microscope. And finally, there was this case report. This was a 52-year old man who developed myocarditis shortly after the Moderna vaccine, and was ultimately discharged from the hospital. They had special permission from the patient to test him for just about every marker of the immune system that you could think of, all these different cytokines and chemokines, and so forth. They're trying to identify an immunological pattern, but the authors were unable to identify a characteristic profile. So back to the 13-year-old boy in Michigan who died three days after getting the Pfizer vaccine. According to the patient's aunt on Twitter, the preliminary autopsy report showed that he had fluid around his heart. Now, the CDC is investigating this, but there is no official autopsy report. But one of the biggest questions is, what did the pathology show when they looked at the heart underneath the microscope? Did it look normal? Or did it show that there was an inflammatory infiltrate like either one of these? Regardless, people, especially males between the ages of 12 and 30 who get the mRNA COVID vaccines, should be aware, especially aware of the possibilities of myocarditis, especially after the second dose, even though it's still very rare. Getting COVID is still far worse compared to the vaccine, including adolescents aged 12 through 15. So right now, Pfizer is the only one approved in this age group between 12 and 15, and studies with the other vaccines in younger children are underway. COVID is less severe and children compared to adults. But the risk of getting MISC following acute COVID infection plus the risk of severe disease in children who have underlying medical conditions and the general desire to prevent COVID in children, they're all valid reasons for vaccination of children. Also, because MISC is associated with immune dysregulation that's precipitated by COVID, immune-related side effects following vaccination in children has to be closely monitored. So that's all for this video.

Dying in the Name of Vaccine Freedom | NYT Opinion,The New York Times,2021-08-23,pd8P12BXebo,"It's hard to watch the pandemic drag on as Americans refuse the vaccine in the name of freedom. You're talking about an unproven, untested vaccine that doesn't even seem to really protect people because people who have gotten the vaccine are getting sick. I went to one of the places with the worst vaccination rate. I don't want to poison force it to me. The tired of y'all trying to control us. The best things we have is our own God-given natural antibodies. It also has one of the worst COVID case rates in the country. The Ozarks. I don't take the flu shot. I don't take the wrong shot. I don't take any of them. I wanted to find out why residents here aren't getting vaccinated. You're trying to mask these kids up. It's detrimental to their health. And what if anything, it convinced them otherwise? Hey, Mr. Green, instructor Martin here. How are you? I heard you had a rough night last night. Christopher Green is 53 years old and fighting for his life. Like 90 percent of the patients in this packed hospital, he's unvaccinated. He's just walking a very thin, tight rope right now. And to be honest, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a vaccine. I'm worried about the risk of getting vaccinated. He's just walking a very thin, tight rope right now. And to be honest, I don't expect him to get out of this without being on a ventilator. And if he has to be on a ventilator, I don't expect him to survive. I immediately asked Christopher, why hadn't he gotten the vaccine? I'm worried about the risk of getting vaccinated. And I don't want to be in trouble with what I have to do. Still not completely 100 percent sold on the inoculation. It was eerie to hear Christopher insist on his individual freedoms, even as he struggled to breathe. Do you think other people have to say that? I mean, I think there's everybody's individual right or choice to do what they want to. So I'm not going to dictate or make somebody feel guilty because they don't. Christopher represents a genuine challenge. Did the American values of individual choice have to take priority over public health? By the time they're here, what can you do? And it's when somebody's in a room really, really sick and can't breathe and suffering. It's just not a good time for a lecture. But the result in a place like Mountain Home is a 36 percent vaccination rate. And people are dying. Let everybody live their own life. I heard this over and over. Freedom, choice. Don't do it because somebody's first ring you to do it. Everyone has the right to choose. Almost everyone I met in Mountain Home told me they knew someone who died from COVID. Most people are undoubtedly concerned about the pandemic here. It didn't feel to me like a QAnon convention. Misinformation certainly exists here. But a powerful force behind the hesitancy is this fundamental idea of personal freedom. But in a community where individual rights are taking precedence over everything else, you get endless individual reasons not to get vaccinated, like believing the vaccine doesn't work. I have two parents in their 70s. Both had the vaccine and both got killed. And the difference for hearsay. He had heard that the people that were spreading the virus were people that had already had the vaccine and that they were carriers. Straight up fear. Oh, just people having reactions. Even among those who overcame their hesitancy, there's a lack of urgency. I don't really have any reasons to be out in the circulation with the rest of the public. I just enjoy my dogs and work out on the farm and raise my co-ed fish. With all these reasons not to get vaccinated floating around, it makes it hard for those who actually do want it. I have a parent who does not necessarily support vaccinations. It was hard because she asked me where I was going. I was like, oh, I'm going to get vaccinated. And she was not very happy with that. What struck me was that Mary Beth had the courage to go against the grain. People should be more concerned about the well-being of those around them. Because I feel like not enough people are thinking about other people when they make the decision not to get the vaccine. There's an irony in someone rebelling against a culture of individualism for the good of their community. But voices like Mary Beths are drowned out by leaders who are contradicting public health officials. No, the state is not going to be requiring in mandated vaccinations. And I don't believe anyone should be forced to take the vaccine. It should be your personal choice. These vaccines are always voluntary and never forced. We don't have to accept the mandates. Lockdowns and harmful policies of the petty tyrants of your craft. We can either have a free society or we can have a biomedical security state. There's no better place to see the impact of this political rhetoric than in the hospital. Only about 50 percent of the staff are vaccinated. None of the unvaccinated staffers were willing to talk. There are just a lot of people that you cannot convince to get vaccinated. Patients, employees, it's very frustrating. It's sad. It's disappointing. Just a few months ago, the staff was planning a cookout to celebrate the end of COVID. But instead of barbecuing, they're now battling another surge. It's exhausting. We're all exhausted. We don't have staff. We don't have beds. One obvious way out is to mandate the vaccine. But in April, the governor signed a law banning government mask mandates and vaccine passports. That shifts the responsibility mostly to private entities. Vaccine requirements as part of employment, attending school, or participating in sports are reluctantly motivating some to overcome their hesitancy. It seems to me that the only other thing that actually sways people here is being in the hospital. I really am upset at myself because I did not get vaccinated. I just, I'm never hurt like I've hurt. It's made a believer out of me. This is what freedom looks like in America today. It's always been complicated. But political leaders should remember that this country was also founded on the idea that government should protect us. After all, in a pandemic, one person's freedom can be another person's death. Probably should have had a little healthier fear that it would need to be taken more seriously. And that is... I mean, I don't know... How close I am to be in a lot worse. I really don't know. Christopher Green died nine days after this interview. He was 53 years old."
Debunking Anti-Vaxxers,AsapSCIENCE,2018-02-15,b03U6BYF9L0,"The number of people against vaccinating themselves and their children has surged in recent years and it can be frustrating listening to their claims. So we wanted to debunk and deconstruct the most common arguments one by one to help you prepare and present the facts in your next encounter with an anti-vaxxer. Why I do not vaccinate my kids? Blog entry 189. Vaccines contain MSG anti-freeze phenol from aldehyde aluminum lead and mercury. It's true, vaccines contain chemicals. Vaccines have contained mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde ingredients that can be toxic. What else can be toxic? Water, given a large enough dose, and same goes for apples, coffee, or too much of anything to be honest. The dose makes the poison, and the doses of the chemicals and vaccines are negligible. For example, vaccines that include aluminum, which is included to make the vaccine more effective, contain about 0.125 mRAMs per dose. But the average person actually takes in an estimated 30-50 mRAMs every day through food and drink. That's way more than one vaccination on a daily basis. And while some people warn about the presence of mercury-containing compounds like thymarasol, a vaccine preservative to prevent bacterial growth, it's actually been removed from almost all childhood vaccines since 2001. This was done to ease public concern, even though no literature suggests it's harmful at doses present in vaccines. As a granola parent, my kids get everything natural. Kenwakrackers overrids any day. Because can't we just all agree that the natural root is better? So just let your child's immune system felt naturally and save them a lifetime of pain. Vaccines introduce a weakened form of the germ to your body so that the immune system can learn to recognize it. Your body then builds its defenses, so it's prepared to fight off a real attack later. And it's true, naturally newborn babies are immune to several diseases because of the antibodies they received from their mother's breast milk and the thousands of germs were exposed to from the moment were born. But vaccines cover the diseases you don't have immunity against. It's why we don't vaccinate for every single disease possible, just those which are most dangerous. And children are given shots at a young age because this is when they're at the highest risk of getting sick or dying. But what about allergies? My second cousin Lisa got her kids vaccinated and now they have a peanut allergy. I don't want my baby to get allergies. In 1997 people began to question whether there was a connection between vaccines and allergies. And then a study of 2100 participants ages 5 to 6 found that vaccines actually have the opposite effect and instead have a protective effect against allergies. I mean how bad are the diseases that these vaccines are preventing anyways? My little sport here stuff like a peck, sausage, got my gene so it was built to last. If you got the measles what's the worst that could happen? Vaccines have done such a good job preventing so many diseases that many generations have never seen them. But here's what these diseases looked like without vaccines. In 1967 smallpox was responsible for millions of deaths. By 1980 it was completely eradicated due to an intensive vaccine campaign. Before polio vaccine was available 13,000 to 20,000 cases of paralytic polio reported each year in the United States. This meant thousands of children had to use braces, crutches, wheelchairs and ventilators to breathe. From 1964 to 1965 before the Rubella vaccine there were 2100 neonatal deaths and 11,000 miscarriages and of the 20,000 born with Rubella more than half ended up death over 3,000 blind and 1800 with mental delays. As for measles before immunization was available nearly everyone in the US got measles because it's extremely contagious. The World Health Organization estimates that regular vaccination has prevented 20.4 million deaths from measles worldwide from 2000 to 2016. Okay but you still have been covered. Autism. Much of the anti-vaccination movement is linked to one paper published in the late 1990s which claimed vaccines caused autism. It suggested a link between the measles' mumps Rubella vaccine causing malabsorption of nutrients in the gut thereby leading to increased cases of autism in children. The study was later proven to be fraudulent and debunked by 25 international research papers involving large population studies. Furthermore 10 of the 13 authors of this original paper have now refuted and retracted their original statements on this suggested link. And while it's understandable that parents want to protect their kids the claim is not founded in any evidence. There needs to be a balance with the government. Parents should have a measure of choice about whether or not they should vaccinate their kids. No one knows their kid better than you do. So vaccinating your kid only affects you and your baby. This is simply not the case. Vaccines protect you and perhaps more importantly it helps other people. If you're not sick you can't spread the disease to those with weaker immune systems, particularly the very young or elderly and those who may have medical conditions in which they can't be vaccinated. For example those undergoing chemotherapy. The more people that are vaccinated the less available real estate for the germs meaning its spreading ability is squashed. This principle is called herd immunity. For the vulnerable in our society herd immunity is their best protection. The NSA, the CIA, the FBI, big corporations, big farmers. The amount of drugs they've taken off the market trusting those suits is practically a death sentence. Pharmaceutical companies do make money from selling vaccines. One estimate puts the vaccine market now at $24 billion which is huge. But if you want to talk money a study found that in the US between 1994 and 2013 vaccine created a net savings of $295 billion in direct costs and 1.38 trillion in societal costs. It's true drugs have been pulled from the market after harmful side effects came to light. However vaccines are among the most highly regulated substances we can put into our bodies in part because they're given to healthy people, usually children, as a preventative measure rather than a treatment. They go through multiple phases of testing to see if they're safe to find the correct dose and to see if protection against the disease actually works. In Canada and the US it can take 10 to 25 years of testing before a vaccine is approved. And once on the market there's continuous monitoring of its effects. The likelihood of a severe reaction to the MMR vaccine is approximately 1 to 1 million, which is around 10 times less likely than being killed by a lightning strike. Thank you so much to Bill and Melinda Gates for sponsoring today's episode. This video is meant to highlight the importance of vaccines which save millions of lives every year. Vaccines are a great example of how modern medicine and technology have decreased disease worldwide. It's part of the reason why the number of children who die every year has been cut by half and continues to go down. Though sometimes it's hard to feel like it, there are many reasons why we should be optimistic about our future. This becomes pretty clear when you focus on the brilliant scientists, dedicated individuals, and new ideas that are solving some of the world's toughest issues. Head to gatesletter.com to learn in the annual letter from Bill and Melinda Gates why they're so optimistic about the future. Thanks for watching and if you haven't already go and get your flu shot and parents please just vaccinate your kids. Thanks a lot. Okay we will see you next week. Bye."
Bill Burr On Anti-Vax Conspiracy Theories - CONAN on TBS,Team Coco,2021-05-20,znI046F4FKg,"There's a lot of people that are upset about a lot of things these days. You know, people are arguing about where they should get vaccinated or not. Have you gotten vaccinated? Yeah. Yeah. I'm up for it, too. I'm like, you know, if they like trying to kill me, which doesn't, that conspiracy, I love a conspiracy, it doesn't make any sense. You don't think the anti-vax conspiracy lines up? That they're gonna, that they're secretly trying to kill each other, all of us for, for population control? No, because what they would do, they would be killing all what they call the sheeple. So all the people who'd be like, all the people that go, what are we supposed to do? Okay, they're gonna kill us. Right. And then just be left with all the fonzies with their leather jackets. Who don't want to, who are too cool to listen to people? Like, they got a nightmare. Who's gonna, who's gonna, they're ditches for them? Yes. It just doesn't, I mean, if you want to say that they're gonna come up with something to thin the herd, I will go with that, but they would never do a pointed attack on people that are gonna do whatever they say. Yes, yes. They're eliminating the wrong group if this is the plan. So maybe they've axed us sheeple, so then they can have a second vaccine of COVID. They come out to kill all the cool people that hit a jukebox and it turns on. So anyone who's anti-vax is a fonzie. That's what you're, they're just all fonzies. Look at me, look at me, we have a couple of Ron Howard sitting here, right? Sure, yeah, we're Ron Howard. We look like I'm at a younger age, I look at like I'm now, and I like to think I'm the Oscar-winning director, Ron Howard, Ron. You're still Ron Figgering Ron. I'm still, I'm towards the end of the Happy Days, Ron. Yes. I might direct a movie. Right around when he started dating Laurie Beth. Yeah. Sorry, that was a deep cut. Yeah. Okay, so the problem is, in our culture now, if you have a weird belief, you can find a source that caters to that belief and you'd have to read anything else because the internet. Yeah, that's why I don't listen to anybody's theories anymore, unless I just go, did you get this information at the library? Yeah. Okay, if you got it at the library, I'll listen to it because the library has a decency to break up information between nonfiction and fiction, meaning this happened and this is just some shit people made up. You go on the internet, everything is presented as nonfiction and that's why, dude, in my lifetime, I'd say for the first 47 years, that nobody thought the earth was flat, right? Right. And in the last five years, all of a sudden people, you know, coming out telling me there's an ice wall that you can go look at like there's these ice walls. Like we're basically in this giant bowl of, I don't know, cereal or something. Yeah. But once again, I'm like, all right, I'll go with that. Right. And then when you see VOR signals and realize one of the things that blocks it is the curvature of the earth, you'll stop trying to rent a boat to go look at the **** ice wall. You know, people are flipping out about masks and on both sides, like there are people that say, you know, I shouldn't have to wear a mask, I don't want to wear a mask, I don't buy it and then there are people that, I love those people. What? You like the people that flip out? Yeah, don't wear it. Yeah. Don't wear it, go kill yourself. Awesome. Because I have to be honest with you, I know a lot of people died from COVID, but I'm starting to see the traffic come back and I selfishly thought I wish it killed a few more. I'm being honest. God. It's an honest, selfish thought that I had. So just specific commuters, we've got to be clear here. No, people that I don't know or love, that I would never miss. It's 100 percent selfish. Okay. You just want to know what's funny is when I looked out there, all the real people were like this and all the cardboard people was still. So I think overall, I think it made sense. Yeah. Kevin Hart agreed with that one. Yeah. All four of them. No, three of them went for it. Yeah. One of them just covered his face. Didn't want any part of it."
The Truth About Anti-Vaccination: A Scientific Look,SciShow,2015-02-19,Rzxr9FeZf1g,"We haven't talked about the vaccine debate here on SciShow because there is no debate to have. Vaccines don't cause autism, and they save millions of lives every year. But there is a debate. Whether or not it makes sense, and a lot of people counter this with ridicule, but we at SciShow aren't about judgment, we're about science, and using it to better understand the world. We see the anti-vaccination movement as a phenomenon to be understood. So instead of making yet another statement about how yes vaccines are good and know they don't cause autism, let's use science to understand why fewer and fewer people are getting their children vaccinated. I'm Hank Green, and this is SciShow. First, let's discuss how we ended up with this imagined link between vaccinations and autism in the first place. Autism diagnoses are definitely on the rise. Now many scientists believe that this is largely or even completely because of more effective diagnosis and changes in how the diagnosis is reported. So while the diagnoses of autism are increasing, we can't say for sure whether the incidence of autism is also increasing. If it is, it must be because of some environmental factor. Now when we talk about autism, we're really referring to a range of developmental disorders which can affect a person's ability to communicate or socialize or cause them to develop patterns of behavior that become pretty specific and inflexible. The condition can manifest itself in a lot of different ways, but you've probably heard of them referred to together as autism spectrum disorder or ASD. While ASD has been found to have some strong genetic components to it, there also seem to be environmental factors at work as well. And that's really the root of this controversy. We simply don't know precisely what causes autism. And in the absence of explanations, people try to make sense of it themselves, and the way our brains do that is almost entirely with cognitive bias. A cognitive bias is really just anything that skews how we process and interpret new information. There are tons of different kinds of bias. Some biases cause us to ignore certain data, others lead us to put too much emphasis on certain data. They can even drive us to focus on facts that are actually irrelevant to what we're observing. But essentially, when we hear a hypothesis and think, yeah, that makes sense. Really what we're saying is, yeah, that fits with my cognitive biases. And so people blame all sorts of things for autism. Plastics, pesticides, the use of antidepressants during pregnancy, GMOs, sugar, gut bacteria, and vaccines. Basically, you start with whatever makes the most sense to the person doing the hypothesizing. The onset of autism typically happens in one of two ways. Either parents notice a delay in language development, typically around the first birthday, or they notice an apparently sudden loss of existing development, which might happen all the way through the third birthday. Now humans are pattern recognition machines. We need to be able to figure out what behaviors and strategies lead to positive outcomes. But even more than that, we're on the lookout for things that lead to negative outcomes. This overweighting of negative outcomes is a well-known psychological effect called negativity bias. So imagine you wake up one morning and your car doesn't work. Your brain is gonna want to know what happened. Did you leave your lights on? Did you drive through a huge puddle yesterday and maybe shorted something out? There has to be some reason why it won't start. On the other hand, if you get in a 15-year-old car and it starts up just fine after having had a bad week of barely getting going, you tend not to wonder, what went right? We spend far more cognitive resources attempting to figure out why a bad thing happened than we do trying to determine why something good happened. In psychology, the search for these explanations is called explanatory attribution, and different people have different explanatory styles. Some people are more prone to blame themselves while others search for an external event to blame. But one thing is clear, we are very bad at not blaming anything. It's not surprising that parents of children with autism, especially parents who notice a sudden loss of previous development, will search for a possible cause. And when the most significant recent event in the health of a child was a vaccination, as can be said for many moments in the life of a young American, we might identify that as a potential cause and deem that link worthy of further examination. Now this is completely logical. The problem is that over a dozen peer-reviewed papers have found no correlation between autism and the MMR vaccine or any other vaccine for that matter. And yet, when you google vaccines and autism, a fair number of the results claim that there is a link between the two, and that that link is being covered up by the government or by big corporations. A parent already experiencing frustration with the medical community's inability to tell them why this thing has happened to their child, will on the internet find a vibrant community of similarly frustrated people who share their values and experiences. These communities are full of anecdotes that draw connections between vaccines and autism, and so unsurprisingly, some people become convinced that they have found the reason for their child's disability. Once their mind has been made up, confirmation bias sets in. Confirmation bias is simply our tendency to more readily, and with less scrutiny, accept information, anecdotes, and worldviews that confirm our existing beliefs. And again, it is a completely normal thing that every person does. Indeed, trying to convince someone that a previously held belief is incorrect has been proven to actually increase their affinity for that idea. And so a community is born, and the safety of vaccines is called into question. And once the procedure for getting a vaccine goes from the doctor telling you that it is now time for a vaccine, and 99 percent of parents agreeing, because that person went through medical school to it being a question to ponder, vaccination rates will go down. A 2011 study showed that parents who think about vaccines before their child is born are eight times less likely to vaccinate their children. Basically, when given an opportunity to do research on their own, what they find is confusing. And when confused, the default choice is to simply take no action. And this is an example of yet another bias called omission bias. In fact, we judge harmful actions as less moral than harmful inactions or emissions. In fact, a frequently cited study found that when the choice to vaccinate is framed as an action, the average parent will only vaccinate their child if not vaccinating is at least two times more dangerous than vaccinating. This has to do with our perception of future regret. Parents report that they'll feel worse if they take an action and it harms their child, then if they don't act and the child is harmed by a failure to act. This perception of potential regret can be so strong that even bringing up the choice of acting versus non-acting seems to be counterproductive. A 2013 study found that attempts to convince parents to vaccinate their children actually decreased the percentage who went on to choose vaccination. If vaccination is presented as a personal choice instead of a necessity for good public health, then potentially harmful inaction can seem more moral than potentially harmful action, and vaccination rates go down. Parents are choosing to let nature take its course. And as you might expect, this effect is much stronger in people with a measurable naturalness bias. This is just a tendency to perceive things that come from nature as being inherently less threatening than things that we invent ourselves. One way psychologists measure this bias is by asking a subject if they'd prefer a substance extracted from an herb or one synthesized in a lab, even if they're chemically identical. And of course, others have biases against big government or big corporations, and these ideas about vaccinations fit well with those worldviews. Confirmation bias at work again. But even people who don't hold these biases end up being more likely not to vaccinate if they start doing research before their baby is born. This is because of another failure of the human brain. We are terrible at what psychologists call risk perception. Given the merest sliver of a possibility that vaccines will cause developmental disorders, parents are now weighing a disease they have seen autism against diseases they have never seen. Since the 1970s, measles has been pretty much unheard of. The measles doesn't scare people my age for the same reason a giant man eating squirrel doesn't scare us. We've never seen it. Risk perception is basically a science all on its own, and we've found that vague future hazards, like the future probability of an illness, are far less frightening than immediate specific hazards, like the sudden onset of autism. So amazingly, the success of vaccines is one of the reasons that people are less likely to vaccinate their children. So yes, it turns out humans are complicated and this is a complicated problem. Humans are inherently bad at understanding the effects of self-selecting samples, like online anti-vaccine forms, and often completely unable to accept that a negative outcome could really be the result of something that's beyond their control, and still not very well understood. This is not an anti-vaxxer problem. It's a human problem. Those of us who trust science or have built an understanding of statistics and bias simply have had different lives than people who more heavily wait anecdotes or the opinions of their friends or strangers they meet online who feel the same way. So next time you find yourself frustrated about the decline in vaccinations in America, remember that it's only because of the dramatic success of vaccines that we could even think of having this debate, and those anti-vaccine activists are being driven by the exact same logic traps and cognitive biases that every one of us suffers from. Only by understanding and accepting these psychological pitfalls that we're all so susceptible to, will we be able to solve this problem? And that is what science is all about.

Covid-19 Vaccine Skeptics Explain Why They Don’t Want The Shot | NBC News NOW,NBC News,2021-03-25,cw0IAAleJxw,"the vaccine is easier said than done, especially in rural areas that are heavily Republican. NBC News political reporter Von Hillard is in Pineville, Missouri. Von, if I understand correctly, that county has the second lowest vaccination rate in all of Missouri. Why are people there so hesitant to get a COVID shot? You're exactly right, Alison. We're talking about just 5 percent of the county here fully vaccinated in just 8 percent of the folks in this region. And we're talking about the COVID-19 vaccine. We're talking about the vaccine. We've received the first dose here. And that comes down to the very heart of the question. Why is there this hesitancy here that is prevailing based off of conversations we've had with folks? And these numbers are reflected in polling where self-described Republicans across the country. About half of them say that either they're not going to get a vaccine vaccine. I don't care if I look like the wise guy or the dumb guy. It's my decision. I just decided I'm not going to do it. I'm a guinea pig if that's the case. Yeah, I'm not going to get the COVID vaccine. I don't feel like I don't know. I just feel like I'm good. I don't need to. I take vitamins and whatnot. And I'm pretty healthy. So. Obviously, we could have a vaccine-like health risk. The health risk, and we need to underscore the fact that public health officials, including those locally here, have said that the vaccine is safe and have gotten the vaccine themselves, but what you continue to hear is this prevailing lack of trust in the government. This isn't just a 2021 thing. We're a coronavirus vaccine thing. But this is a mounting ever growing distrust in the government at the vaccine. We're actually just down the road. There's a clinic that was underweighted today and there will be tomorrow. The supply is here in town. It's a matter of folks calling up and making their appointment here from some of these folks who did get their vaccine talking about others in their community. Oh, I've heard quite a few people say they're not going to get it. They're afraid to put things in their body. They're afraid they're going to get something from it. They're afraid that just I don't know there's a lot of people who are going to get it. Oh, you got to go to Facebook and you'll get bombarded with the people thinking that the vaccine is going to kill them. It's more than just in this community. You're seeing this reflected nationally in these mostly largely white conservative rural communities, even up on Capitol Hill. In the US house, there are still more than 100 members who have declined to get the vaccine despite it being available to them over the last three months, Allison. All right, Vaughn Hill, you're always love having you on news now. Great to see you there in Missouri."
Covid-19 Vaccine: It's Not Just Anti-Vaxxers That Are Worried,Bloomberg Quicktake,2020-08-06,Qgk9ofpMN34,"There's no question that vaccines and vaccination programs are vitally important to public health and that a vaccine for COVID-19 might be our best shot of beating this pandemic. But getting people to take the vaccine, getting them to trust the government's information around the vaccine is going to be a real challenge. Around the world, more than 100 teams are in a race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. The front runners are already in late-stage clinical trials. We don't know when, but one or more of them may just get there. We might even have a vaccine for winter. But what's more in public health authorities is the possibility that a significant number of people may decide they don't want to be vaccinated. Because there's all these anti-vaccines now, isn't it? Well, Maria, can I give you a minute about how we've been in the form? This isn't just a case of countering the claims of anti-vaccines that are a small but hardcore community who dispute the efficacy or the safety of vaccines. The internet is full of conspiracy theories around COVID-19, around treatments, and indeed around vaccines. So that's going to be one problem. But what about ordinary people who get their flu shots, take their children to be vaccinated, want to be a part of the solution to this pandemic? But have doubts about whether a vaccine that's developed so quickly, a vaccine that is so new can be taken without unintended consequences. That's a question. Governments are going to have to face. Very important. Just because a vaccine is being developed at such great speed doesn't mean that it's less safe or effective than a vaccine that takes, say, 10 years to develop. Great deal of money and resources are being put into compressing the time tables that would normally be stretched out. Just the same reasonable people may have uncertainties. Even a large scale clinical trial only tells us so much. It tells us that a vaccine is safe and effective for the period of that clinical trial, for the demographic, the age group. But that doesn't tell us that the vaccine is entirely free from long-term effects. It doesn't tell us that the vaccine is going to be safe and effective for all people no matter what their underlying health condition. So it's going to require a degree of public confidence in the government's assurance that it's safe to take repeated doses or doses with a large amount of time between the first and say the second dose. So all of these things present a challenge to governments as they seek on the one hand to convince people to take a new vaccine. And on the other to rebuild trust that's been lost through the early response to the pandemic, when so much of policy has been presented as certain and subtle science, when in fact it was not at all the case. So we were told that masks were not needed until they became mandatory that widespread testing was not essential until we understood that it was absolutely the key to understanding how transmission was working throughout the community. So governments have an enormous job to do to rebuild public trust, which includes not only the benefits of taking a vaccine, but also some of the risks and at least the uncertainties involved. I'm Tara Zrafayel with Bloomberg opinion."
Bill Gates on the anti-vaccine movement,CBC News: The National,2015-02-25,dZSL8OnBLlc,"There are pockets and significant pockets of the country where vaccines aren't happening because of those, you know, the anti-vaxxers or whatever you want to call them who have made significant headway in trying to convince parents they shouldn't vaccinate children. I was just looking at new data today from Orange County, California, with more than a few schools showing between 40 and 60 percent children not vaccinated. You could say this is a, we're a victim of success. In the countries where you have measles all the time, nobody gets confused about this. Did you get mad about it? I get more mad about the deaths we're not avoiding. I spend, you know, my time on the countries where you still have, in the case of measles, over 300,000 kids dying a year, in the case of diarrheal diseases over a million a year. There are 6 million kids who are still dying. Why aren't we getting vaccines out in Africa? For diarrhea, for respiratory disease, why don't we have a vaccine for malaria? Those are the things that I, you know, I push forward. I wouldn't say get angry, but I'm really impatient that we're not moving this fast as I'd like. You can catch the full interview this weekend on one-on-one. On Saturday, it's on CBC News Network at 630 Eastern, or on Sunday, tune into CBC Television at 1230 local time.

How Anti-Vaxxers Rejecting COVID Vaccine Could REALLY Impact You - TLDR News,TLDR News,2020-06-02,RcVGE93nFUc,"Now, conspiracy theories and fringe beliefs aren't normally within the scope of our videos. We generally cover news, politics and current events, but as the Covid crisis rumbles on, the influence of these theories seems to be ever increasing, and there's no conspiracy that's seeing a larger surge than the anti-vax movement. As I'm sure you know, governments around the world are currently scrambling to research vaccines that could cure Covid-19, and while progress is being made, it seems that we may still be a fair way away from a vaccine, with the possibility that a cure may never be found, as we discuss in a recent video that's linked down below. But even at this early stage, there's already people saying they won't take the vaccine. Some don't trust vaccines as a whole, and others don't trust this vaccine specifically. In fact, this is such a widespread belief that an AP-NORK poll found only about half of Americans say that they'll take a Covid vaccine, with a fifth saying that they'll definitely refuse it, and 31 percent are unsure. Things may change between now when it's a hypothetical question, and when the vaccine becomes available, but that's a remarkably low number. And that really matters to everyone. The only way you can truly stop the spread of a virus is if enough people get immunized, preventing the viruses continue to spread, and if only about half of the population sign up to get the vaccine, that simply won't happen. Limiting the success of a vaccine programme. So in this video, we're going to discuss the vaccine, the general anti-vaxxer movement, and why this vaccine is especially worrying to some people. If you haven't already, please subscribe to the channel for more news updates like this one. We're closing in fast on 375,000 subscribers, and when we get there, we have a big announcement. We also have dedicated US and EU channels if they're more to your taste, both are linked in the description below. The first thing worth noting is exactly why people have reservations about this specific vaccine. As you probably guessed, the main reservation is about the speed at which the vaccine is being created. As pressure is being put on scientists to create a vaccine by governments, citizens and policymakers, it becomes increasingly likely that scientists will develop an entirely new kind of vaccine. Some interpret this to mean that corners will be cut with vaccine development, which could lead to the coronavirus vaccine being unsafe. In fact, of the Americans that claim they won't take the vaccine, 710th say that this is due to concerns about safety. This has prompted members of the scientific community to insist that despite the increasing pressure to speed up the vaccine development process, safety will not be compromised. The way that Dr. Francis Collins has put it is that the aim is to not sacrifice rigor in the process. However, it's important to ask exactly how the vaccine will be created at such a reduced time scale without sacrificing the rigor in the process. In order to do this, the standard process must be explained. Just for context, all of the following information comes from Welcome, an independent scientific research group, and there's a link to their website in the description below. When creating a vaccine, there are usually five stages, which in combination normally take over 10 years to complete. The first is the discovery stage, where lab work takes place to discover how to produce immune responses to a particular disease. Then there's a preclinical phase, which generally involves animal testing, then the clinical developments, which have three phases, including human testing, then the regulatory review, which contains all of the necessary paperwork and clearance for a vaccine, and then finally manufacturing. As I mentioned, added together all of these stages can take in excess of 10 years to complete. In fact, Welcome also claims that each vaccine costs on average between $200 million and $500 million. They estimate though that due to the speed at which the coronavirus vaccine is being developed, it could cost in excess of $3 billion. However, due to the global interest in this and the numerous different countries and organizations involved, this isn't a particularly concerning figure. So you may be wondering exactly how the development process may be adapted, to make sure that it's done quicker while maintaining the scientific rigor that Dr. Francis Collins insisted on. Well, firstly, the discovery phase has been significantly sped up, made possible by the fact that the virus's genome was sequenced incredibly quickly by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, as well as the fact that many people are simultaneously working on research around the world. Then comes the second stage that includes animal testing. This is either being reduced massively or going to be skipped entirely. However, the third stage that focuses on the safety to humans absolutely will not be skipped. It will be sped up though, thanks to many concurrent tests happening across the world. The longest part of the production of a vaccine will be testing whether the vaccine actually helps against the disease, and whether the immune system does produce the antibodies needed to stop the disease. But with the plans for concurrent global testing, it's predicted that this phase will still only take 8 months. Researchers from the University of Oxford have already started testing a vaccine on humans, as of 23rd April. 1,102 people have been lined up to take part in this trial, with one half receiving the potential vaccine, and the other half receiving a meningitis vaccine. The aim is to discover if the immune system produces a good immune response, and whether there are any side effects produced. Another vaccine is also in a similar stage, being produced by Pfizer. They've tested 360 younger people, before opening the tests up to older people too. Again, the aim with these tests is to prove that the vaccine is both safe and effective, and goes to demonstrate that the human testing element of the vaccine production is not being skipped, and that safety is being taken incredibly seriously by those involved in development. The final part is the regulation and approval, which could be sped up a lot without impacting safety. Just because the regulation is handled faster doesn't necessarily affect the rigorousness of the process. As with more people and effort being put into the regulation process, the same number of man hours can be compressed into a few months. It's also important to note that a lot of these stages will be run in parallel, in order to reduce waiting time. For example, development can be run at the same time as human trials, so that if the vaccine is found to be safe, development won't take us long. With normal vaccines, this simply isn't economically viable, and each stage will be forced to take place one after another. But with the world in lockdown and a vaccine being essential to get the world moving again, it's seen as a financial risk worth taking. So although the time to develop a vaccine has been cut substantially, this will not be at the expense of standard procedure. Human trials will still take place, and the vaccine won't be distributed unless it's been found to be safe and effective for humans. But that still begs the question, are vaccines even normally safe? Well, although here at TLDR News, we aim to be impartial on all topics. There are some cases where presenting both sides of an argument as viable and reasonable can normalize dangerous ideas. For this reason, although we'll discuss some of the arguments made by anti-vaxxers, we'll try and demonstrate why they're flawed. The first argument that's often made by anti-vaxxers is that there's evidence of autism being linked to vaccines. This claim is based on a 1997 paper by Andrew Wakefield, whose subsequently lost his license due to malpractice, was refracted from the paper he was published in, was found to have multiple ethical violations, and to top it all off, had serious procedural errors. Multiple papers have since been published that find no link between the two, and have undermined Wakefield's paper. In fact, the CDC has a web page that lists all of the known side effects for each approved vaccine, and at no point on the page is autism mentioned. In Vax, I think this is a good point to discuss risks with all vaccines. It should be noted that there are most certainly risks associated with vaccines. There is an inherent danger of side effects when it comes to vaccines, but these are often minor, and as the CDC point out, go away after only a few days. Secondly, within the anti-vaxxer community, there tends to be a view that diseases contracted in a similar time when the vaccine was administered are as a result of the vaccine itself. But as always, correlation does not equal causation. This is something that the World Health Organization tackles head on in their rebuttal of anti-vaxx beliefs. They give an example of the DTP vaccine, which some have linked with sudden infant death syndrome. However, it's again a correlation causation fallacy. This is because most infants get vaccines when they're first born, so attributing getting these vaccines with a syndrome that only affects infants doesn't seem all that fair. The WHO even goes as far as saying, you might as well say that eating bread causes car crashes, since most drivers who crash their cars could probably have been shown to have eaten bread within the past 24 hours. Another key argument from anti-vaxxers is that if a disease is already beaten, why should they expose themselves or their children to a vaccine? Well, again, the WHO shows that travelers from other countries could bring the disease with them, and it could restart the disease, moving through an unvaccinated population of a country. However, if the country had been vaccinated, such a resurgence simply wouldn't be possible. Also, there are some people in the population who can't get vaccines, whether that's due to allergies, or having an immune system that doesn't provide the required response to the vaccine. Therefore, the argument is that the duty of people who can get the vaccine to do so, reducing the potential for spread, and protecting those who can't. The WHO claim this is similar to following road traffic rules. People shouldn't just rely on other road users to keep them safe, and the same is true for vaccines. They only work if we all take part. And so this brings us back to the statistic mentioned at the beginning of this video. There's a large portion of the US population who don't believe that the vaccine will be safe, and therefore say that they won't take it. In order for this vaccine to be successful against the disease, though, it requires a large proportion of the population to take it, as is true of all vaccines. Although this vaccine will invariably be created at a much quicker speed than other vaccines, it's not fair to say that it should be any less safe. The human trials will still take place, and it will not be distributed unless it's found to be safe. A large reason why this vaccine will be created so quickly is due to the different stages being run in parallel, which normally just wouldn't be financially viable, but in this case makes sense. It's understandable that people will be cautious about this kind of thing, and given the chaos and confusion surrounding COVID, it's easy to get worried. If vaccines were being rushed through without sufficient testing, that would of course be a major concern. But hopefully this video has highlighted how the process actually works, and why the vaccine should be as safe as any other. Do let us know your thoughts in the comments below, though.

Nurse speaks out after being subject of anti-vaccine conspiracy theory,NBC News,2023-04-10,TW5BttKUlZo,"Few Americans know what it's like to be the target of a conspiracy theory, but since the day nurse Tiffany Dover faded while getting her COVID vaccine, life has never been the same. And tonight she's speaking out for the first time in an exclusive interview with NBC's Brandy Zadrosni. Tiffany Dover wants the world to know one thing. A message is simple. It is that I am alive. I'm well. That's it. I hope they believe it. They are the massive online community of conspiracy theorists who've been convinced she's dead for more than two years. I made a whole podcast about it. Tiffany wasn't ready to share her story then, but now I'm ready to just put my story out there own that story. That story begins in 2020. Tiffany was working as a nurse manager at CHI Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, putting in grueling hours on a COVID unit. When vaccines arrived that December, Tiffany became one of the first people at her hospital to get the shot. I felt okay during that. Then she stood up to answer questions. I'm sorry. I'll sit there. I ended up passing out. So that created the opposite effect of what I would have liked, but you got right back up. I did. And this is something that's happened to me my whole life. I do have episodes where I pass out. But in that moment, a conspiracy theory was born. People thought that I was dead. People thought that I was an actress paid to do this. That I was paid off by big form. It was completely overwhelming to be honest. It's snowballed fast. I have people showing up at my house. I had people reaching out to my friends, my family. I've been received death threats. Were you afraid for your family? Absolutely. Yes. Through it all, Tiffany kept silent and that only made the online frenzy worse. Why not come out and dispel these rumors? Initially, that was exactly what I wanted to do. And unfortunately, I was told that that absolutely would not happen. The hospital told you not to speak out. Correct. Yes. It would be irrecoverable damage is what I was told. If I was to speak out and have another episode. Instead, the hospital put out this video, intending to show she was alive. But the so-called Tiffany Truthers picked it apart and used it as fuel. Online anti-vaxxers and that movement are sort of using you as their poster girl. It's hard to think that you are being used to detour somebody from getting the vaccine. And that was really hard for me to cope with. Are you saying you blamed yourself? Absolutely. I wish that we would have used it as a platform to speak out on the fact that people do pass out after getting shots, vaccines. But that is not a reason to not proceed with getting them. CHI Memorial has repeatedly denied knowledge of any directive asking Tiffany not to speak or post, including in an interview for our podcast. I'm not aware of anything that asked Tiffany not to respond. The hospital recently telling NBC News, we have no new information. A year ago, Tiffany left CHI Memorial. And while she hopes to work as a nurse again one day, for now, she's focused on reclaiming her life. Even after all of this, there will be people who say, we don't believe you. What then? At this point, you know, I've done what I needed to do. I've put it out there that I'm alive. They have to choose whether they believe that or not. And that's all I can do. It's without the truth.

It's Time To Stop Shaming Anti-Vaccine Patients,Doctor Mike Clips,2021-08-25,oaHvef66xHk,"I think the key component here that we've lost is as cheesy as it sounds as empathy. I think we've stopped caring about other people. Once we find out, they disagree with us or we disagree with them. And it's impressive to me as a young doctor how far empathy goes. Just the other day, I had a patient who came in after getting their first dose of their COVID vaccine. They had a mild side effect, which potentially had nothing to do with the vaccine, but it was happened in a similar time frame. They didn't want to get their second vaccine, one that are no to excuse them from their employer for getting the second vaccine. And I've seen colleagues, other doctors, I've spoken to fellow doctors who are like, if that happens, I just say flat out no, I just cancel the visit because I'm not writing a no to say don't get the vaccine. I stand for the vaccine, et cetera, et cetera. So I said, let's take the visit and I'm going to go away and just explain why I'm not going to do it, which is something no one's ever done with this patient. And I explained that it's simply this, if you came in and you had symptoms of Lyme disease and I diagnosed you with Lyme disease, I'm going to go on the CDC website and see that Lyme disease can be treated with this antibiotic. It used to be recommended for 21 days. Now we've seen 10 days is enough and I'm going to give it to you for 10 days. We're going to treat it and we don't even need to do a test of cure. You're going to be good unless symptoms continue. And the reason I'm comfortable doing that is because the CDC did the trials. So now you're asking if you are one of the individuals who shouldn't get the vaccine. I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to go on the CDC website and there's two contrary indications for who should not get the vaccine, those who had an immediate allergic reaction or severe anaphylactic reaction. You don't fall into those categories so I won't write you the note because this is what the guidance is. Do you feel like I'm doing the right thing and all of a sudden they're like, yeah, well, you know what? You are doing the right thing, man, but that puts me in a hard spot. I'm like, I know. And they're like, whoa, no, it's ever said that someone feels bad for me. And now we're on the same page with someone who completely disagrees with me. And we after the visit, I'm like, look, my goal here with this visit is just to get you into a contemplative state that you may get the second dose. And we agreed on that. And to me, that's a huge win. That is the human connection. So okay, all right, this is worth exploring a little more Mike because like this is something that I used to do very wrong. I'm wrong a lot, dude. I mean, it's shocking. We all are wrong. That's the point. Oh, but I've been so wrong in the past about things that watching the old videos just makes me cringe. This is pre pandemic stuff, even. So I actually at one point in my career felt that shaming anti-vaxxers was a good idea because they were so dangerous to children. This was the pre pandemic stuff. And it never works to convince anti-vaxxers. I would rarely ever get emails from people saying, hey, I was on the fence and you convinced me with your crazy rant about how stupid anti-vaxxers are. Okay. Almost never. Then I started to wake up a bit actually after really understanding John Hyde and actually being exposed to different beliefs and the why. Like why is it people feel the way they do? And when you really dig into it, you go, I can empathize with that. I, oh yeah, actually we share the same goal, which is our kids should be healthy. So and you really think this is going to help. So of course you're going to, in fact, I should love you for trying to do the right thing for your kids. Oh my gosh. So then it changes. It shifts your perspective. Then you go, okay, all right. So now we're in a situation where people understandably actually are afraid of vaccines because it's been so politicized. On both sides, it's been tribalized. They don't understand how can they possibly look at the primary trial data and go, oh, these are tens of thousands of people on a randomized trial. You know, and they're looking at VAERS data and going, look at all these people who are dying after being exposed to the vaccine. And then you actually do the math and go, oh, that's the actual number of people exactly you would expect to die in a population over that period of time. So you're seeing correlation, not causation, but how do you expect? Well, you have to take the time and you have to hold the hand, but you have to come from a place that you did, which is I'm listening to you. I hear what you're saying. Here's why I think you should do this, but your decision is your decision. And honestly, there's some people I tell like, you know, oh, I've had COVID. I'm pregnant. I don't want to get the shot just because I'm a nervous. I'm like, well, study, say you're okay. And that pregnancies are a risk factor, but you've had COVID. So you have some natural immunity. So I don't think there's a decision you can make that's wrong. It's based on your values. If you were my wife, I would highly advocate that you get the vaccine."
Preparing the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273),Immunization Academy,2021-05-17,PAZjboKjPA8,"In this video, we will show you how to store, Thor and administer the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. We will also explain how it differs from other vaccines you may administer. First, a few basic facts about the vaccine. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine comes as a frozen suspension in a multi-dose vial. Each vial contains 10 doses of vaccine after sawing. And once thawed, the vaccine is ready to use. It is administered in two doses, which are given at a recommended interval of 28 days. The root of administration is an intramuscular injection in the upper arm. And it is currently recommended to be administered to people who are 18 years of age and older without an upper age limit. In clinical trials, the vaccine given in two doses was shown to be 94 percent effective. What is different about this vaccine compared to other vaccines? First of all, it has different cold-chain requirements and it must be thought before using. The storage and administration requirements are also slightly different. First, let us review how the vaccine should be stored. Frozen unopened vaccine vials can be stored in a freezer at temperatures between –25 and –15°C from receipt until the expiration date. Sored unopened vaccine vials can be stored in a refrigerator at temperatures between 2 and 8°C for up to 30 days. Vials that have been thawed should never be returned to a freezer and re-frosen. Do not store the vaccine in insulated passive containers with dry ice or ultra-low temperature phase change material or in a freezer below –40°C. While the vials are in storage or taken out for a vaccination session, minimize any exposure to light, avoid exposure to direct sun or ultraviolet light. Now, let us talk about how to thaw and prepare the vaccine for administration. During transport and storage, the vaccine should be kept frozen in temperatures between –25°C. Therefore, before being administered to vaccine recipients, the Moderna vaccine needs to be thawed and brought to room temperature. This can be done in two ways. Vials may be thawed at room temperature at 15°C for 1 hour or the vials may be thawed in refrigerator at 2 to 8°C for 2 hours and 30 minutes. In this case, vials will need to be taken out of the refrigerator and kept at room temperature for 15 minutes before vaccine administration. Once thawed, the vaccine is ready to use. Do not dilute. Again, once thawed, the vaccine is ready to use and does not need to be diluted with a separate diluent. When the vaccine has reached room temperature, swirl the vials gently. Do not shake the vials. Inspect the vials to make sure the liquid is white to off-white in colour. The vaccine may contain white or translucent product-related particles. If any other particles or discoloration are present, discard the vials. On the vials label, write the date and time of first use. The first use is when you first puncture the vials and withdraw the first dose. Before withdrawing each dose, swirl the vaccine vials gently. Never not to shake the vials. Next, draw up a .5ml dose into the A-D syringe. Each vaccine vials contains 10 doses, so before withdrawing each subsequent dose, the vaccine vials should be gently swirled again. Administer the vaccine into the upper arm of the recipient using an intramuscular injection technique. After the first dose has been withdrawn, keep the vaccine vial at temperatures between 2 and 25 degrees Celsius. There may be some vaccine left in the vial after you withdraw the 10th dose. Do not combine remaining vaccine from multiple vials. Discard the vial. Follow safe injection practices to avoid any needle-stick injuries. Dispose of used syringes in a safety box immediately after vaccine administration. Discard opened vaccine vials after 6 hours or at the end of the immunization session, whichever comes first. To ensure the vaccine recipient's safety, ask them to sit in the waiting area for observation for 15 minutes after the injection, or for 30 minutes if they have a history of anaphylaxis or if they have had anaphylaxis in the past. Do not administer the vaccine to any person with a known history of anaphylaxis to any component of the vaccine, or who developed anaphylaxis after the first dose of this or other mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. You should now know how to store, thaw and administer the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and understand how it differs from other routine immunizations."
FDA allowing changes in administering Moderna vaccine,FOX59 News,2021-04-02,Doqpy8MEgdU,"In the meantime, the FDA allowing changes to the way moderner shots are packaged, stored, and then given out. The agency is letting moderner put five extra doses in each vial allowing shot administrators to extract 11 doses out of current 10 dose vials. Also, an open vial is now usable for 12 hours instead of six. These changes will allow the company to get more shots out quicker."
Dr. Fauci Anticipates Moderna Vaccine Will Be Administered ‘By Early Next Week’ | TODAY,TODAY,2020-12-18,TNZxQLj_AnI,"Joining us now is Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH. Dr. Fauci, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. We'll talk about the hospital situation in just a moment, but let's start with the vaccines. I know they're all equally near and dear to you, but the NIH oversaw the trial for that Moderna vaccine. It's now been approved overwhelmingly. How soon do you think we'll see shots in the arm? I would anticipate, Savannah, that we likely will see shots in the arm by the very early part of next week. I would hope Monday or Tuesday, but we just have to wait to see for the final decision. But very soon, literally within a few days. One of the things we learned in this hearing is that Moderna's vaccine apparently not only prevents disease but also prevents infection. Now, first of all, what is the distinction between those two things? I kind of thought all vaccines did that, but the distinction, but also, why is it important? Why would that be significant? Well, when you protect against clinical disease, that's the primary endpoint of the vaccine trial, namely, prevents you from not only getting infected, but from having symptomatic disease. You could theoretically and in reality get infected, but be protected against actually any clinical manifestations. So if you protect against clinical disease, that's very good. But if you also even prevent a person from getting actually infected, that would mean that you're preventing someone from passing the infection on to someone else. And that kind of interferes with the chain of transmission. That seems hugely significant. Yeah. Yeah, well, yes, that is. What we need to know as we go through maybe more months of following up is just to what the extent of that is. You would like optimally to not only prevent against disease, but to prevent against infection. That's the ultimate goal. This is one of those times when we need to flood the battle. We need as many vaccines out there as we can possibly get. Just realistically, when you survey the scene, you know what's coming down the pike. How many vaccines ultimately do you think are headed toward approval? How many more might we get and when? Well, in the United States, we've made investments in six candidates. Five of them now have either completed phase three clinical trial or are well into phase three clinical trial. The reason of which I think you mentioned correctly, you want to get as many out there as possible because you want enough doses to vaccinate everybody in the country and even to make a contribution to the global effort to contain this virus by getting companies to make investments so that not only the United States but the rest of the world, that's just us six candidates. You have China, you have Russia, you have the UK, they are all making vaccines, which is very, very good. There's no competition here, Savannah. We want as many successful candidates as we possibly can. We had Secretary Azar on the show on Monday and he said that he thought the vaccine, some vaccine would be available widely to the general public as early as late February or March. Do you agree with that timeline? You know, the answer is in many respects, yes. I have been saying end of March beginning of April. It really is going to depend on how successfully and effectively we roll out the higher priorities because as you know, the advisory committee on immunization practices with the CDC has put together a priority list. Once you get through the priority list, then you could say it's sort of open season for anyone who is not necessarily on a priority list like the normal man and woman in the street who has no underlying condition. That likely will be somewhere Marchish. I said March April, February March. It's going to be a close call on that. The vaccine is the bright spot. Everything else honestly seems very, very dark. We just saw what happens in California. They're ordering 5,000 extra body bags. Some hospitals are having to put patients in parking lots because of the reaching their capacity. Feel like you and I have been talking about this armageddon moment for the healthcare system for months. Are we there? You know, it's a tough situation, Savannah. And we're sitting here talking about vaccines which is such a positive thing. But all of this is sort of bittersweet because at the same time as we're moving ahead with what will ultimately be the answer and the final solution to this, we're living through very, very difficult times. I mean, if you look at the number of new infections between two and 300,000, the other day we had 3,565 deaths in one day. So we still are in a serious situation which tells us that as we are proceeding with the rollout of the vaccine, we absolutely have to adhere to the public health measures that we're talking about all the time, the wearing of masks, the physical distancing, the avoiding crowds in congregate settings. We can't just say, well, there's vaccine on the horizon. So let's just forget about everything else. We're in a difficult situation, so we've got to do both. We've got to proceed with the rollout of the vaccine, but we've got to make sure we stay with the public health measures. Vice President Pence is going to be vaccinated a little later this morning, Speaker Pelosi, Senator Mitch McConnell, gonna get the vaccine, which raises the question, when might you get the vaccine? I know a lot of folks will feel better if they see you do it. I'm ready to go, Savannah. We're waiting for the supply to come in to the NIH. We haven't gotten our supply yet. I hope it's going to mean in the next couple of days. If it does, I'm going to get vaccinated as soon as I can. I hope that's going to be within the next few days to the early part of next week."
800 Doses Of Moderna COVID Vaccine Already Administered At Fort Meade Were 'Improperly Handled',WJZ,2021-04-22,s9vkhLmM56c,"a military base vaccination site and it could mean hundreds of people now need to get a third COVID shot. Welcome to the news at 11. Everyone. I'm Rick Redder and I think Carter on two days this month 80 miles at Fort Meade were stored outside the recommended temperature. The problem now that means it may not be as effective as it should be and WJZ live at 11 o'clock tonight. Kelsey Kushter explains what happened here and everything happened. We're going to be looking at the vaccine. We're going to be looking at the vaccine. Rick, we know that the Moderna vaccine needs to be stored at freezing cold temperatures and officials say those vaccines that Fort Meade that were miss handled were held at room temperature for over 24 hours. Now it's forcing members of the military to now get a third dose of the vaccine just to make sure they're protected. A third day officials announced 800 doses of the Moderna vaccine were compromised and inadvertently administered. Instead of going from the freezer to the refrigerator to store, it went from the freezer to room temperature. It remained at that state beyond the 24 hours which calls into question. The efficacy of the vaccine. Colonel Tracy Michael says his department at Kimbro ambulatory care center administered the bad batch of shots at McGill training center on the hospital. The hospital reported the vaccine was being held at the town hall meeting. He says the 80 affected vials were handled by two people at the storage facility and not at the vaccination site. It wasn't until staff members were moving things around when they made the shocking discovery. They can not guarantee that the vaccine will provide the full protection that it was intended to. His team is now scrambling to reschedule appointments for a third shot. Dr. Bill Moss said the vaccine is not the only effective vaccine. The downside is that the vaccine may have degraded and thus not have been effective. Dr. Bill Moss at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health calls this an unfortunate event. He says it shouldn't deter anyone from getting vaccinated. It's one of our best tools in the toolbox to prevent hospitalizations and deaths and really to get on top of this pandemic. Now Colonel Michael says that they have made some changes to the vaccine. The vaccine is not the only effective vaccine that they have been doing. It's a great way to make sure that this doesn't happen again. He says that includes vamping up their training on how to properly store the vaccines. It also says that they're going to add more people to make sure that those vaccines are properly handled reporting live tonight. Kelsey Krishna for WJC."
The night shift inside a New York City hospital's covid-19 unit | Voices from the Pandemic,Washington Post,2020-04-08,C3IC-LnELj4,"My name is Sunam Ahmed. Today is Saturday April 4th. I'm a critical care attending with the Institute for Critical Care Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. I'm doing a night shift tonight and I will be responsible tonight for critical care consults on COVID patients which means that myself and my team are responsible for stabilizing the sicker COVID patients, putting them on a mechanical ventilator for those who need it and then facilitating a smooth transfer to the ICU. I guess when I left my house today I sort of had mixed feelings. On one hand I left my kids at home so that I could go and fight this war along with my colleagues but on the other hand I feel optimistic. I also feel hopeful because despite how challenging my night will be we hear good things every day. I'm here because I just brought someone here. We had a lady that I was asked to see on the floor who was having a real hard time breathing. So I've just intubated her and she's now on a ventilator. I put in a central line to support to in order to give her some medications to support her blood pressure and an arterial line to monitor her blood pressure appropriately. So we have patients here ranging in age from 31 to in the 80s and we're working hard to save them. We have our ICU team here. Hi guys. Hey everybody's working hard. Awake despite the late hour. It's been a busy night but I'm now going to sit down and write some notes. Okay here we are in Tennis. We've been called to that side to see a patient who's having some problems with oxygenation. So we have a respiratory therapist here and we're gonna go to the look. Hey and see if this patient requires mechanical ventilation. Okay so it is the morning of Sunday April 5th and I have just finished my night shift and I'm gonna get ready to actually getting ready to go home. I walked out a little mark here from wearing my mask all day but made it through and I'm gonna head home and get a little rest. I woke up a little while ago. I was thinking about one of the patients who I saw who was very sick yesterday. She was only 34 years old and she was really struggling with her breathing. She had a acute respiratory failure and I had to put her on the ventilator. It was pretty challenging to do so but you know we got her we got it done safely and took her to the ICU to continue management for her respiratory failure with COVID. When I think about the upcoming week I'm gonna be off tomorrow and then from Tuesday on I'm working the entire week and it's a little bit scary because it's supposed to be the peak until then I'm gonna try to get a little rest and a little family time."
Covid: Moderna vaccine given approval for use in UK | ITV News,ITV News,2021-01-08,sC8oDlGQz6M,"Originally, Moderna's vaccine wasn't even on the government's shopping list, but it's now the third to be approved and more doses are on order. It's all the more welcome as the government is relying on vaccination to get COVID-19 under control. The Minister in charge promising he can meet the target of protecting the most vulnerable by the middle of next month. This is a huge weekend for us. So today, Saturday, Sunday, you're going to see big numbers of people being vaccinated, especially in care homes. And my target is very much to hit that number, the 14-15 million by mid-February. Of the vaccines now approved, the government has ordered 17 million doses of Moderna to be rolled out in the spring. 40 million doses of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine first used exactly a month ago, and 100 million doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, which began its rollout this week. But the number of people actually vaccinated so far stands at 1.5 million. Doctors fear that some vaccine is actually being wasted, and tonight one urged ministers to clarify how to use the Pfizer vaccine. Each vile apparently contains enough to inoculate six people, rather than five, as originally laid down by the regulator. Getting the vaccine done and delivered appropriately with no wastage is probably one of the most important things we as doctors and as health care professions can do right now. It will not only help the hospitals, it will help our economy, it will get things back on the road to recovery. So every little dose of this is gold dust and should never be wasted. In another move to protect the public, the government says those arriving from abroad will now have to provide proof of a pre-departure negative COVID-19 test. It's something he throws boss says is long overdue. We've been calling for testing as the solution, as an alternative to quarantine since April of last year. And we really need to see a common international standard for testing, because at the moment it is very piecemeal. Different countries have slightly different standards and different tests that they recognize. And it's very confusing and can be distressing for passengers, not knowing what they will be expected to do. For now they will be expected to quarantine as well as provide a negative test. Ministers believing that the risks are too great to ease up on any existing measures. Libby Vina, ITV News, Westminster."
How does Moderna's Coronavirus vaccine work?,The Telegraph,2020-11-16,w_5zQzIb5Uc,"It all started with isolation of the virus from an infected patient in China. The coronavirus was sequenced and its genetic information was uploaded to a public database. Working together, scientists at the NIH and Moderna identified the sequence for a key protein on the surface of the virus called the spike protein as a good vaccine candidate. The instructions for making the spike protein were then encoded into an instruction molecule called mRNA, which could be administered directly to patients as a vaccine. The vaccine is injected just like other vaccines. The mRNA is taken to immune cells where it instructs cells to make copies of the spike protein as if the cells had been infected by the coronavirus. Other immune cells shown here as red and orange figures are then able to learn about the spike protein and develop ways to protect the person if they ever come into contact with the actual coronavirus. What makes this approach different is that you don't need to make the virus itself to make a vaccine, a time-consuming and intensive process. Instead, you use the information from the virus and administer the information directly to the patient. Essentially, the patient makes their own vaccine. This cuts out the middleman using this approach. NIH and Moderna were able to go from sequence to a vaccine ready for human testing in record time, just 42 days."
Moderna Explains: How Do mRNA Vaccines Work?,IEEEEMBS,2021-08-02,aXdq9OhBx54,"Although the development of COVID-19 vaccine seems quick, Moderna has been investigating our platform for the last 10 years. So every cell that has a nucleus has DNA and that's really the lock box for all of our personal information. But then somehow that DNA information needs to get translated into proteins. So DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA in the nucleus. mRNA exits the nucleus and then in the cytoplasm of the cell, ribosomes translate that messenger RNA into protein. So a messenger RNA vaccine just capitalizes on that natural process for protein synthesis. We've known probably for about 60 years that messenger RNA could potentially be a way to deliver proteins. We also knew it had adjuvant effects, meaning it can actually increase an immune response. It actually took that log to really develop the mechanism to be able to deliver the messenger RNA into the cells. And in fact, we deliver the messenger RNA with a lipid nanoparticle, which is really just a fancy way for speaking about a blob of fat that ensures that that messenger RNA isn't broken down by body's natural mechanisms. So when you get your vaccine and your deltoyed muscle, the lipid nanoparticle also helps it target to the lymphatics. And once the lymphatics drain into that lymph node, that's really where there's a high concentration of antigen presenting cells. And those are really the cells that are the target of this vaccine. We're delivering the messenger RNA directly into the cytosol, not altering the DNA indeed. And the ribosomes then translate that delivered messenger RNA sequence to create a protein that's expressed on the surface of the cell. In the case of COVID-19 vaccine, it's the spike protein that's expressed on the surface of the cell. And then the rest of the immune response happens as it would normally happen if your cell were infected by a virus. Only in this case, there's new virus. There's just the messenger RNA. The spike proteins hang around for about 48 hours. The messenger RNA up to 72 hours. So they are rapidly degraded like any protein. The immune system actually has been designed to really develop the cells that then recognize that protein again upon reinfection or rechallenge. And that's really how the vaccine then prevents us from getting infected. At the moment, there are two messenger RNA vaccines. So there's the one from Moderna, the one from Pfizer, both of them expressing the spike protein. Moderna is undertaking an exercise to investigate what happens if we swap out the sequence for the original Wuhan strain. Our idea is that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines could become like influenza vaccines, where good epidemiology is tracking what's happening in real time. And then we're able to put the relevant sequence into the vaccine before people would need it. And those studies are actually underway now, both in a priming series and in a booster dose for people that have already received primary vaccination."
"How the Moderna Vaccine Works, Why It’s Effective, and How It’ll Be Distributed | GZERO World",GZERO Media,2020-12-11,tU3rsJQyxd0,"So you're kind of the man of the year right now. I mean, when did you realize that what you've been working on is truly game-changing? Well, Ian, about three weeks ago, we received the first look at the interim results from our Phase 3 trial, 30,000 subjects involved. And that glimpse already indicated that we had a very strong, statistically significant signal of efficacy at 94.5 percent. And we kind of cracked open the whole, kind of the final analysis of the results. And what we saw across 196 cases is a 94 percent efficacy. And importantly, we saw in serious COVID cases a split of 30 to 0, 30, all 30 cases were in the placebo group, which represents 100 percent protection. That boasts well for a broader population. Obviously, this is a relatively small study compared to what we expect to vaccinate. But that all kind of sinks in pretty quickly. And the 10 months of work we've done to get to this point following 10 years of science and technology development. But the last 10 months now, all of a sudden, has shifted our emphasis and focused to how are we going to get this vaccine distributed? And how do we ensure that it's safely administered that we track the folks who receive it? So there isn't much time to look back. But certainly, it's a super gratifying and sense of relief to know that the science and the technology that Moderna pioneered some 10 years ago seems to be having a pretty significant impact. As you say, this is a completely new technology for the audience. Just give us one quick minute on how this works, the mRNA vaccine. What is it that makes this unprecedented in human beings? The central tenet in biology of life is that DNA is a molecule that stores information. Messenger RNA, mRNA, is the piece that copies that information over to making proteins, which are the important parts that govern the functioning of different cells. So Messenger RNA is what we use to deliver the information to the body of the subject. And inside the body, we have specially formulated this such that the mRNA can get into certain cells that in turn translate the mRNA into proteins, just like the cells know how to do. But the protein we've coded for is a protein that is on the surface of this coronavirus. So what we're trying to do is to educate the immune system to see the protein before it's seen the virus and be ready with the arsenal of immune cells and antibodies to attack that protein. Now, when a virus shows up to somebody who's had their immune system activated in that way, the immune system knows exactly what it's looking for and neutralizes the virus. That's why we see this kind of efficacy. Now, there's a very, very big difference between, the research that's required to get this vaccine discovered, if you will, and producing it for a billion people or more around the planet. So how do you do that? It's about people, it's about partnerships. We forged an early relationship with one of the leading, if not the largest independent contract manufacturer of biologics company called Lonsa, publicly listed, very good partner of ours. I'd say but for them, we would not have quite the path that we've had in terms of scaling. They have a plant in Switzerland that they've devoted a certain section of for this. So partnerships, people, resources, and the rest is ahead of us. There's a long, long way to go. But sometimes, as you've seen in other industries, it helps a little not to know what you can't do. It helps a little to have to make it up as you go because there's a lot of things people think can't be done that if you are in a large company, you might actually decide therefore not to do. And in a pandemic, I think Moderna is certainly going from the initial sequence of this virus to having a designed mRNA being tested in two days and then tested in humans in 42 days, I don't think a large company by any measure would dare do that because they think it's completely impossible. And not until we did it, that a lot of other people joined the fray and realized, oh my God, this can be done. We better have our own way of doing it too."
How mRNA vaccines work,Harvard University,2021-02-16,TbaCxIJ_VP4,"Researchers have found that the COVID-19 virus begins the process of creating copies by attaching its spikes to a host cell. Those spikes offer a target for vaccines, with the right preparations our immune system can utilize this vulnerability. A vaccine is used to arm our immune system. It contains messenger RNA, which can direct cells to make specific proteins. The messenger RNA tells our cells to produce COVID spikes. These harmless spikes give our immune system the information needed to quickly detect a coronavirus infection and produce the appropriate antibodies. The new antibodies respond once COVID has entered the body. They attach themselves to the spikes on the COVID virus, rendering the spikes useless, protecting our cells and keeping the virus from reproducing. mRNA vaccines have been studied rigorously and are a safe and effective way to defend ourselves against COVID-19 infections."
KT Explains: How the Moderna vaccine works,Khaleej Times,2021-07-06,sG5FFwwSr04,"Following the recent approval offer the vaccine by Moderna for emergency use by the Ministry of Health and Prevention, the UAE now has a fifth vaccine that is introduced in the country. The vaccine is reported to have a high efficacy rate of 94 percent. It was introduced by the United States and first authorized for emergency use by the Federal Drug Authority on December 18, 2021. Earlier this year, the US had also announced plans to distribute over 80 million doses globally by the end of June this year. So let's take a look at how it works. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, Moderna also uses mRNA technology. This means that the vaccine is based on the virus's genetic instructions for building the spike protein to trigger an immune response. After the injection, the vaccine particles bump into cells and fuse to them releasing the mRNA. The cells' molecules read its sequence and build spike proteins. Some of the spike proteins form spikes that migrate to the surface of the cell and stick out to their tips. The vaccinated cells also break up some of the proteins into fragments. When a vaccinated cell dies, the debris will contain many spike proteins and protein fragments, which can then be taken up by a type of immune cell called an antigen presenting cell. When other cells called helper T cells detect these fragments, the helper T cells raise the alarm and rally other immune cells called the B cells to fight the infection. The antigen presenting cells can also activate another type of immune cell called acylote cell to seek out and destroy any coronavirus infected cells that display the spike protein fragments on the surfaces. Moderna's vaccine requires two injections given 28 days apart to prime the immune system well enough to fight off the virus. Moderna also announced they will be producing 800 million to 1 billion doses in 2021 and plan to manufacture 3 billion doses in 2022. Moderna's vaccine will also need to be refrigerated and should be stable for up to 6 months when shipped and stored at –4 degrees Fahrenheit or –20 degrees Celsius. This approval for the emergency use comes as the UAE also overtooks say-shells to become the world's most vaccinated nation. As for the latest studies, it has been proven that the Moderna vaccine is IPA50-LNS-DATA-plus variants. The both variants have been identified by the virus for concerns. Many countries have affected by these samples to impose symptoms. So this family apparel might help us to overcome this deadly variant."
Moderna works with the NIH to advance potential coronavirus vaccine,CNBC Television,2020-01-28,ivg4VdJ5uek,"And as we first told you right here on Squawk Box, BioTech Company, Moderna is working to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus and make your own eye to a rare look inside the lab where the research is happening. Meg joins us at the table this morning. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Moderna is working with the National Institutes of Health to advance a potential vaccine and told us they started the work earlier this month. The company's technology is called messenger RNA and what it does is essentially deliver genetic instructions to the body cells to make proteins. To develop a coronavirus vaccine, Moderna and NIH first had to identify the viral protein they'd want to encode, meaning the part of the virus the vaccine would teach the immune system to recognize. The next step is to develop a large enough batch of the potential vaccine for the NIH to conduct a phase one human clinical trial. And that is what Moderna is working on now. We've been able, oh, I hear from Moderna. We have been able to develop a dramatic amount of experience in how to design messenger RNA drugs and we're putting every bit of that experience to work right now in the novel coronavirus vaccine. And of course, the company's goal is to get this batch to the NIH within a couple months. If they're successful, the next challenge is ramping up on a much larger scale. Have they ever developed a successful vaccine for anything else? They have conducted six phase one clinical trials, but the technology is... People have developed vaccines for things like this based on... Yeah, we had Dr. John's on the surface. Yes, that's right. Yeah, we had... But I'm not going to put my money on J and J on this."
How well do the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work?,KHOU 11,2020-12-02,sffi5YGpADg,"We know many of you have questions about how these vaccines work and if they're safe. I want you to know we are listening and we are getting you answers. Stephanie Whitfield is breaking down what we know and don't know about how well the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work. There are 11 COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials happening right now in the U.S. Pfizer and Moderna are the furthest along. Pfizer's 2-dose vaccine potentially days away from getting emergency use approval. I've been working on viruses and vaccines for the last all heavens 3035 years. Dr. Alan Barrett is the director of the Celi Institute for Vaccine Sciences at UTMB. He says the FDA is using symptoms as the benchmark for if COVID vaccines work. Pfizer and Moderna say their vaccines are 95 percent effective. So it's a great story. However, saying that these vaccines were evaluated seven days after the second dose of vaccine. So we know that the vaccine's inducer really good immune response in people seven days after the second dose. But we don't know how long immunity is going to last for. He says we also don't know if the shots prevent infection altogether or if people with the vaccine can be asymptomatic and still contagious. The hope is these vaccines prevent infection and transmission too. But Dr. Barrett says more research is the only way to know for sure. Clinical trials will go on for at least a year after the first shipments of vaccine go out. Stephanie Whitfield, CHOU, 11 News."
How do the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 Vaccines work? | Roger Seheult,FoundMyFitness Clips,2021-04-05,SDYo6hO8MhI,"If you think about mRNA vaccines, it's like an envelope with a message in it. And that message is going to tell the cell what kind of proteins to make. This is exactly what happens, by the way, when you get a viral infection, when you get coronavirus, or any other coronavirus, or any other RNA virus that comes along, is that virus fuses with your cell, whether it's in the cells in your nasal mucosa or anywhere else, and it basically tells those cells to make protein, to make foreign proteins. And so in that sense, this is no different. We're just doing it in a way that doesn't cause more viruses to be made. You see that when you get infected with a virus, the virus tells the cells to make more of everything. Make more RNA, make more viral proteins, so your cell can make more virus. In this sense, the mRNA vaccine is only telling yourself to make a portion of the protein, which we want the immune system to recognize, so that if it ever comes around again, the immune system is ready to attack it, and to prevent it from invading your body. So in that sense, this is like a sort of a deadens virus that we're putting in. But it's not even that. It's not even a virus. It's just a portion of the mRNA. So what about mRNA? mRNA is in the cytoplasm of the cell. It's not in the nucleus of the cell. And if you could imagine, you know, we had a professor on from San Diego, Dr. Crati, who I love his analogy. It's like a Post-It note. mRNAs are like Post-It notes. They're here today, maybe a few days later, they're gone. You crumple it up and you throw it away. They are not like your marriage certificate or your social security card that you put away in a filing cabinet that you never take out, and it's like the original. That's like your DNA. That's like in the nucleus. So that is not what an mRNA is. mRNA is like your scratch at Post-It notes that you post in your room and that you're here today and gone tomorrow. So there's really not a danger that this mRNA is going to hang around. And even if it were to hang around, the purpose of the immune system is to find these cells with this foreign mRNA in it because it makes proteins that are foreign and to destroy those cells. That's why you get an immunogenic response when you get the flu vaccine or in this case the mRNA vaccine. You get pain at the site. You get a little bit of a fever, perhaps. You might have some muscle aches, body aches. It'll feel like you actually have a viral infection because that's your interferon. That's responding to it. That's your adaptive immune system eventually that's responding to it. So that would explain Moderna's vaccine and also Pfizer's vaccine. Thank you."
Moderna says its COVID shots work for kids under 6,Associated Press,2022-03-23,AbyPClYgrxU,"The really good news is we met the primary endpoints of that study, meaning that the vaccine provides the same level of protection against COVID in young kids as it does in adults. What really shouldn't matter most to us from a public health perspective is preventing those bad outcomes in severe disease hospitalization. That did happen. Unfortunately, hospitals, pediatric hospitals did see a lot of COVID-19 this last winter. And the good news is we have every reason to believe that the vaccine will prevent all of those outcomes or most of those outcomes. We do know vaccines in adults prevent the worst outcomes, particularly severe disease, hospitalization, and death. But we also know that in adults, vaccines after two doses have been less effective at preventing home-acron infections because home-acron is just that much more effective at infecting people. The efficacy we saw in children was lower, but it was about the same as what we've observed in adults after two doses."
What we know about the Moderna Covid vaccine,The Independent,2021-04-07,GJob6bjkw-c,MUSIC you
Russia's Sputnik V vaccine: What the experts say | COVID-19 Special,DW News,2020-10-05,Wjk5NHoElSw,"Russia calls it relief for the world. These shipments contain the vaccine candidate, Sputnik. 2000 Venezuelans will try it out, including a member of the presidential family. In this clinical trial phase, my son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guera, taught me of his decision to be vaccinated with the Russian vaccine, to join the trial. I think it's very good. Belarus was the first foreign country to receive batches of the vaccine last week. India is also interested in testing it. For Russia, it could be a Sputnik moment, like the one in 1957, when the communists launched the first satellite. In August, Russia declared itself the first country to approve a coronavirus vaccine. The various groups have been receiving Sputnik V, health workers, journalists, teachers. Alongside China, Russia has been deploying the shots before full efficacy trials are complete. The results are promising, but the vaccine has been met with some skepticism. Washing his hands multiple times a day, just one of a series of hygiene measures Semyon Galperin undertakes. The doctor doesn't want to take any chances with coronavirus, but he knows a vaccine would offer the best protection against COVID-19. That's why he's volunteered to take part in testing a new Russian one. Someone has to do it. Without clinical trials, they are no medicines. The effectiveness of a vaccine can only be evaluated in the third phase of clinical trials. Stage three of the trials began a month ago, but the vaccine, which has been named Sputnik V, was licensed already in August before they began. Mass inoculation in Russia is planned for later this year. Something numerous experts have sharply criticized. The Russian government rejects the criticism. It says the vaccine has been developed from already known substances and doesn't pose any health risks. Russia urgently needs an effective vaccine. The country currently has the fourth highest number of coronavirus cases worldwide, and the numbers continue to rise, with around 6,000 new infections each day. Galperin and other doctors working say they are not worried about the vaccine's safety. After all, the vaccine has already been tested on several well-known public people, and they're doing quite well. These public figures include Russian defense minister Sergei Shogil, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin, and one of President Vladimir Putin's daughters, potent PR material. It's part of Russia's strategic interests to always want to be first. Irrespective of whether it's a revolution or the first flight into space, now it's about saying that we're the first to develop a vaccine. Internally, we're showing that the situation is under control. Externally, it's a signal that Russia is still mastering its role as savior of the world. Semyon Galperin isn't thinking about his country's PR plans just now. The doctor is here because he's hoping to help win the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. People are tired. They wanted to be over. The new vaccine would help calm people and offer a way out of the situation. It will most likely be at least several months until the results of the face three trials are known. Only then can the actual effectiveness and safety of Russia's puttnik-5 vaccine be assessed. Noah Batif works at the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Will the Russians be the first? We want lots of people to achieve a vaccine. It's not about who's going to be first. It's about as many people as can cross the finish line really to have a safe and effective vaccines. We want multiple winners here. The Russian vaccine is certainly doing, moving into face-luch scale face-trees as on many others. We want licensure to occur after the completion of those face-trees when we have good safety data and good efficacy data that the vaccines actually work. So it's lots of people we want to succeed here, not just one group over another. On the point of safety, have the Russians been fudging the numbers as some have accused and skipping parts of the trials? There's no good solid evidence that there's been any concern about the numbers. The detail that was given in the Russian papers, the paper was excellent. The quality of the evidence was as solid as any of the other published papers. There have been some lay reports on blogs and so on. Those really don't hold water when examined thoroughly and statistically. So I don't have any more concerns about this group than any other group, particularly now. Now, the modified common cold viruses behind such vaccines have been studied for decades but are still not widely used. Why is that? There are a number of other vaccine platforms that we have a lot more experience with. The advantage of Adam of ours, Vectored Vaccines, is that they are potentially capable of delivering almost any antigen to the immune system. And the vector itself is designed to be non-replicating so it can't cause infection. The capacity to do that, the capacity to develop these vaccines has been in development for quite a long time. Only recently has a reached licensure under the pressure really of developing a vaccine against the Bolivirus and that's been a success. So that's good and we'd like to see more of these vaccines going forward. Clearly we need lots more experience with them, particularly around safety and around efficacy. But there's no reason to suspect that there'll be problematic vaccines. In fact, they're likely to be very good vaccines. When you have a range of potential at an OVRS Vector, some are more frequently encountered by human populations than others, then there are differences potentially that could arise among the different products. And that's some of the detail that's coming up from some of the scientific literature. But as a platform, it's a really exciting platform and we hope that there'll be lots of opportunities to develop this platform with vaccinology beyond this pandemic into the future also. What's the certainty though that vaccines that pass phase three will be successful for the wider population? There's never certainty. Science is built on uncertainty and falsifiability. So it's really important that our methods are as rigorous as they can be. And it's important that we continue to evaluate the vaccine even after it's rolled out and even after it achieves licensure in phase three. Phase three trials are the trials that demonstrate large scale, you know, in terms of tens of thousands and collectively close to hundreds of thousands of people, safety in trial participants. And importantly, efficacy against disease. So actually protects human beings against disease. That's the minimum that we require for licensure. If a vaccine is very rarely harmful, causes serious harm very rarely, then society has to weigh up the pros and cons. As with all vaccines, they all are potentially harmful but very rarely so, but they are very, very beneficial and frequently so. So it's always a question of balancing the risks and benefits and that correct balance requires good science, good surveillance and good evidence going forward beyond phase three and beyond licensure, willing to many use of hopefully future use. You've said it's problematic if a vaccine is designed to target the disease and not the infection. Why? Well, it's not exactly right, but you're close. I mean, all vaccines really are designed to target disease. But clearly we're facing a complex situation currently with coronavirus because we have widespread infection and transmission occurring globally. I think the public expectation is that once a vaccine is available, we go back to the way things were and we stop masks and we stop social distancing. And that's a misjudgment of what a vaccine, at least in the initial phase, can do. The aim of the vaccine is to reduce disease and to reduce it in vulnerable groups, at least initially in the first round of vaccination. If a vaccine is only given to those at a high risk and not to everybody, clearly transmission will continue to occur in those who didn't receive the vaccine. But even a year from now or a year and a half from now or two years from now when the vaccine is more widely available, it'll be critical to demonstrate that it actually reduces transmission and not just reduces disease. Because if it doesn't do that, then the only other ways to reduce transmission are to continue with face masks and so on. One could imagine a paradox whereby if the vaccine continues to allow transmission and works less well to protect against disease in the other lead that in a paradoxically adverse outcomes could get worse, not better. So we need to be very careful about how we deploy vaccines on the basis of the best available science and evidence around what they do, what their efficacy is against. No, about, Steve. Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you for having me. And it's that part of the show when we look at your questions on the coronavirus is DW Science correspondent Derek Williams. Are any countries testing school age kids on a wide scale too? If so, what are the results? Because COVID-19 in general at least doesn't affect children as severely as older people. Kids in general have not been tested as much throughout the pandemic. It's simply been a question of resource allocation. But the lack of really solid data has also led to a lot of speculation that kids might not be much of a factor in spreading the disease throughout wider society, which has in some countries influenced things. Like decisions to reopen schools. But now a big study from India could cause authorities to rethink that idea. It focused among other things on contact tracing data from 85,000 confirmed cases in two states there. In total, it looked at test results from over 500,000 contacts that occurred between people who were infected and the people they gave it to or didn't give it to. And one of the most interesting takeaways was that it showed kids actually do pass the disease on to other kids, especially those in their age group, which would include, for example, kids in the same class at school. What the study wasn't able to clarify was how often those kids subsequently might have passed the virus along to adults. But even so, the evidence now looks pretty compelling. It indicates that the idea that kids don't really spread COVID-19 doesn't really hold water, which a lot of researchers have said shouldn't actually come as a surprise."
Sputnik V: the science behind the vaccine,Sputnik V,2020-12-01,mUI0R3VGDSw,"Sputnik V is the first registered vaccine against COVID-19 in the world. It's a human vaccine based on the human adenovirus vector. So how does Sputnik V work? Protein-coating genes from the spike of coronavirus are inserted into two human adenoviral vectors. Vectors are viruses which are genetically modified so they cannot replicate. They are safe for the body. Since vectors carry only protein-coating genes from the spike of coronavirus, it is impossible to get infected. During the first vaccination, an AD-26 vector makes its way into a cell and the development of immunity begins. The second vaccination with vector AD-5 takes place after 21 days. It boosts the immune response and provides long-lasting immunity. Sputnik V is based on a human adenovirus vector platform that has been studied over the decades and proven to be safe. Vaccines based on human adenovirus vectors have clear advantages over other technologies that are much less studied. All trials show the effectiveness of the vaccine and no serious side effects. The Sputnik V vaccine demonstrated more than 91.4 percent efficacy. Sign up for updates and follow Sputnik V on social media. Sputnik V stay tuned."
Russia delivering Sputnik V vaccine all over the world,Channel 4 News,2021-02-15,kSwxlujVOm0,"A belief existed that the Soviets were somehow not quite capable of doing this. The Soviet Union won the race to send a satellite into space, and the surprise of Americans when they heard the spot-necks beeping in 1957 is what inspired the director of the Russian Direct Investment Fund to come up with this. He chose the name for his nation's new coronavirus vaccine, the Sputnik V, whose V stands for victory, a Soviet symbol recast as a new weapon in a new century for a new war. President Putin surprised the world last August announcing Sputnik V had been given regulatory approval. His daughter had it, he said, and she was fine. Russia had won the race, but it was accused of cutting corners. Other vaccines in development, including the Oxford AstraZeneca offering, were in their critical third phase of human testing. Russia had only put Sputnik V through testing phases one and two before declaring victory. But that's not the way it works. So I hope, but I haven't heard any evidence to make me feel that's the case. I hope that the Russians have actually definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that. Six months later, peer-reviewed preliminary results published in the Lancet Medical Journal showed Sputnik V is safe and effective on par with Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford AstraZeneca. I think the floor just to congratulate Russia for this success. And it's a good news for the whole mankind, because it means that we are going to have more tools to face the pandemic. But back in August, celebrations and congratulations from a skeptical international community weren't forthcoming. Just nine days after Putin's Sputnik V announcement, it was a different Russian chemical invention in the news, Novacok. Opposition activist Alexei Navalny was poisoned with the nerve agent, which Russian agents are understood to have put in his underwear. He since recovered only to be imprisoned, sparking huge protests across the country. These aren't the scenes President Putin wants the world to focus on, rather these. Russian universities open again, life is normal, the COVID battle slowly being won, and COVID-19 patients on the mend, recovering with Tai Chi therapy. And more importantly, these deliveries of Sputnik V to other nations. Now racing for the biggest global market share, Russia claims 50 countries have requested 1.2 billion doses, many middle to low-income nations. Through the developing world, where it's urgent, it's less about the politics. If the science is there, which the likes of the Lancet is, I'd give them good grinds, then the politics can wait. And if there's strings attached, developing countries don't pretty can have the luxury of holding out for that. So Russia's in a good position in that respect. Venezuela received a shipment. Iran's first jabs were last week, and in the West Bank too. Belarus, Bolivia and Argentina were early adopters, and Hungary was the first EU nation to approve it for use. The country is the largest country in Hungary, the country is the country's largest country. As most superpowers concentrate on vaccinating their own populations as quickly as possible, and the WHO backed Kovacs scheme to share vaccines, faces supply delays, Beijing is stepping up international distribution of Chinese-made vaccines, perhaps to immunize its damaged reputation, in a sense, wanting the world to forget. But Russia, it seems, wants the world to respect, what might be its biggest scientific achievement since the Soviet era."
Sputnik V: Why Russia's Vaccine Diplomacy Failed,Carnegie Endowment,2022-01-06,PyJjs-zx_XE,"The earliest stages of the COVID pandemic provided a showcase for authoritarian countries like China and Russia that tried to call the world's attention to the West's fumbling of the crisis. Then, in a deliberate echo of the space race of the 1950s, the Kremlin announced that Russian-Sci-design created Sputnik V, the world's first COVID-19 vaccine. Funding for the Russian scientist was provided by the state. Aided by a splash media campaign, Moscow energetically touted Sputnik V is the answer to the world's prayers. It was affected, relatively inexpensive, easy to store, and well-suited for conditions in countries in Africa, Latin America, and beyond. Russian science and business prowess to the marketing campaign stress could help close the gap in vaccine equity between wealthy and emerging economies. Unlike Western pharma companies, Russia was ready to license production of Sputnik V to companies in countries around the world. But Russia's victory in the global vaccine race didn't work out as planned. Moscow rushed its vaccine to market before anyone else, creating uncertainties about the ability to deliver doses on a massive scale, and lingering questions about the thoroughness of its clinical trials. Global health bodies, regulatory agencies, and researchers expressed concerns about important vaccine development data. Delays in obtaining an emergency use approval from the World Health Organization and other major global regulators cooled the enthusiasm of potential customers. In South Africa and Brazil, scientists flag concerns about the safety of manufacturing processes and efficacy of the vaccine. The vaccine's backers also significantly overestimated Russia's capacity to produce the drug, or to take advantage of global supply chains. Despite sign deals for over 1 billion doses worldwide, actual production and delivery of Sputnik V have fallen way short. Take in Gola, its government wanted 12 million doses, but only 40,000 had arrived by summer 2021. Welfly behind on its targets, Gola turned to Serbia to secure additional supplies. It increasingly uses European and Chinese vaccines instead. Similar delivery delays caused a political uproar in Argentina after nearly 20 million promised doses of Sputnik V failed to show up. A senior adviser to Argentina's president privately threatened to cancel the country's whole order. She warned that her government's popularity hung in the balance. Argentine voters soon proved her right. In other parts of Latin America and Africa, Moscow reportedly awarded resailed rights to middlemen. That led to inflated costs, questionable procurement practices, public relations problems, and inquiries over possible corruption. All of this is happening amid frustration over vaccine inequity and wealthy countries refusal to share vaccine technology. That would help countries in the developing world to scale up production, save lives, and get their economies back on track. Sputnik V could have been a moment for Russia to shine on the global stage. Russian science produced a vaccine that provides protection against the virus. Yet Moscow's flashy propaganda and decision to use Sputnik V is a tool of its global activism, inflated expectations, and overwhelmed promising solutions to a real world problem."
Russia: Sputnik vaccine is 92% effective against coronavirus,Reuters,2020-11-11,mj_5ACPLnNM,"Russia said that its coronavirus vaccine called Sputnik appears to be 92 percent effective at protecting people from the disease, according to interim trial results. The Sputnik vaccine figures are only the second to be published from a late-stage human trial, coming hot on the heels of American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer earlier this week, and its own promising figure of 90 percent effectiveness. The Sputnik research comes from the first 60,000 trial participants to receive both shots of the two dose vaccine. Analysis was conducted after 20 participants in the trial developed COVID-19, and then examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo. However, outside experts said knowledge about the trial's design and protocol was sparse, making it difficult to interpret the figures. The Russian Direct Investment Fund are the main backers of the Sputnik vaccine. They remained positive and say it was the sort of news developers would talk about one day with their grandchildren. The Russian trial announced it would continue for six more months, and data from the study will also be published in a leading international medical journal following a peer review. Sputnik takes its name after the famous Sputnik satellite of the 1950s space race."
"Sputnik V: Proven Vaccine, Political Ploy, or Both?",Bloomberg Originals,2021-04-26,TKxqXgwZqU4,"ГОВОРИТ ПО-АНЦЕСКОВИТ Насколько мне известно, сегодня утром зарегистрирувано впервые в мире, зарегистрировано вакцино против новой коронавирусной инфекции. в мире не было так уж. Роша has become the first country to give regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine. Но есть мере, вопросы и консеранса уже. А vaccines so quickly and from a country notorious for propaganda and deception. The issue is not about the science of the vaccine. It's about the approach that was used by the Russian government in terms of proving and starting to use the vaccine before the Phase III clinical trial data was in. Starting to use the vaccines, starting to try to export the vaccine and launching this entire propaganda campaign actually works against the product. After first facing scrutiny on whether Russia's vaccines actually work, now the question has become whether they can meet worldwide demand. Critics and observers are now left wondering, is the Kremlin playing vaccine politics as part of a campaign to undercut Western powers and their technology? Or is this a case of solid science being tainted by allegations of Russian hacking, poisonings and interference in democratic elections? Russia is scrambling to bring COVID-19 under control. Russia is battling a surge in COVID cases. The virus came late to Russia, but it is definitely here now. Russia reported its first COVID-19 cases in January in Siberia and Russia's Far East. By July, officials reported almost 840,000 cases and more than 30,000 excessive deaths. Global health experts, however, have questioned the accuracy of Russia's data, deeming the number of COVID-19-related fatalities too low given infection rates. Russia acted very swiftly to impose restrictions. It was one of the first countries to enact a total ban on the entry of Chinese citizens. And by late March, it had imposed a shutdown of its borders and a series of lockdowns across the country. Meanwhile in Moscow, the Gamalaya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, named after pioneering Russian vaccine researcher Nikolai Gamalaya, got to work. They called the project Sputnik V. Sputnik V is a reference to a very important date in Soviet history, which was the launch of the world's first satellite Sputnik in 1957. And that marked the start of the space race between Soviet Union and the United States. In naming it, after that, it's clear that Russia was positioning itself as a player in a geopolitical struggle. By May, the Gamalaya Institute had already started testing their vaccine on the center's director, as well as key scientific staff, a move which seemed to place Russia ahead of other countries in the vaccine race. The Institute supplied vaccines for use against the Ebola outbreak in Guinea in 2017 to 2018. The COVID-19 vaccine that they developed was based on technology they had earlier applied in an experimental inoculation against the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome or MRS. And that's what allowed Russia to go ahead relatively quickly in developing a COVID-19 vaccine. I know that this vaccine was made based on one of the virus vectors. But on August 11th, when President Putin announced that Sputnik had been registered as the world's first COVID-19 vaccine, it hadn't started vital phase three trials, prompting worry among the scientific community and mockery from the Trump administration. I was extraordinarily surprised to see that announcement in August. Not surprised that they were working on it, not surprised they started the clinical trials, but very surprised and a little bit disturbed to see them starting to use it before they had the data. For Putin, it was clearly very important to be first in the world to release an approved vaccine. And so the entire state propaganda apparatus worked overtime to present this as a huge victory for Russian science, for the Russian farming industry, and basically as proof of Russian superiority in areas where the country has long been written off. Isn't it premature for Russia to have approved this vaccine before phase three trials are substantially underway? Not at all. At first we were criticized, but then we saw that Britain announced that they may follow the suit. US and Gays said that they may want to register before phase three. The suspicion that this is a propaganda tool rather than actually a way to fight COVID-19 was obviously there, and it was expectable that we actually, the Putin government has done a lot of ugly things to earn the suspicion and distrust of, especially Western nations. Obviously there was a certain handicap to overcome, and that could not be done with premature front air. It could only be counteracted with scientific proof, and scientific proof was eventually delivered. On February 2nd, in the esteemed medical journal The Lancet, vaccine experts, professors Polly Broy and Ian Jones, reported that Sputnik V appeared safe, with an efficacy rate of 91.6 percent. This was really a chance for Russia to dispel a lot of the skepticism surrounding the vaccine and whether it was actually good at combating COVID-19. I think it's fair to say that demand increased as a result of that breakthrough. In Europe there has definitely been a change of sentiment. There are shortages of the vaccine in Europe, so now the EU is looking at a request to approve the use of Sputnik V. In addition to that, several European countries, France, Germany, Spain and Italy may also manufacture it. So it's definitely fair to say that there was a change of heart. Everyone who has a delay in the European medical agency is welcome. I spoke with the Russian President exactly over this. We read the data from the Russian Embassy. Sputnik is very similar to both the AstraZeneca vaccine and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in that it's an ad-no virus-vectored vaccine. And what that means is that they're using a common cold virus to deliver a little bit of the COVID virus to your own cells and sort of tricks your cells into making just a little bit of the COVID-19. And with that little bit, which is the spike protein, your body is able to mount an immune response so you develop T cells, you develop antibodies that all respond to COVID-19 if you should get infected in the future. Sputnik V is also double-vectored, which means that it uses a slightly different version of the vaccine in the second dose, so protection against COVID-19 could last longer. I don't necessarily think that in terms of the vaccine itself and how it works in the body, it exhibits any advantages over the mRNA system. Now vaccines like Sputnik, like AstraZeneca, and like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine that are all ad-no virus-vectored vaccines are much more stable in warmer temperatures. And so that makes this cold chain much easier, that means the storage and the distribution is much easier, and so all of that is a real, positive strength. The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson shots have in rare cases been connected to blood clots. Russian officials claim that Sputnik, though developed in the same way, hasn't caused similar side effects. All of this, combined with a relatively low production cost of $10 a dose, makes Sputnik V a viable option for developing countries that are struggling to either obtain or distribute inoculations. But there are questions about how much politics will impact the vaccine's distribution. We do not do politics, and obviously vaccine is our effort to save people and it should not be politicized. Russia clearly has been using the vaccines, but Nik-V as a way to bolster its global ambitions in Latin America, for example. Argentina has already had deliveries of 2.5 million doses. It's ordered a total of 20 million. Mexico is another big buyer. They've asked for 24 million doses. Russia hasn't asked any countries to pay a premium, however, it's not offering any discounts for poorer countries. So in Latin America or Africa, the price is the same as anywhere else, and that's approximately $10 a shot. We know that some Western manufacturers are providing discounts for developing countries. However, Russia's farm industry wasn't prepared for the level of demand for Sputnik V. The RDIF, Russia's sovereign wealth fund, who were financing the vaccine, had to strike production deals around the world to support the global supply for Sputnik V abroad. There are definitely still problems in ramping up production. Russia's total production of Sputnik V since the pandemic started is less than the number of vaccine shots administered every two weeks to the US population. It is now promising to produce much larger quantities, particularly in India. In India, it has a very ambitious target of 700 million two dose sets, which is hoping to get manufactured outside Russia this year. Closer to home, there's been a lack of enthusiasm for the vaccine, with a recent poll revealing that 62 percent of respondents wouldn't take Sputnik V. Despite ordering mass inoculations in January, Putin himself didn't get vaccinated until seven months after the August announcement. The Kremlin said he was focusing on other inoculations. It was not made public which of the Russian vaccines he received. In a way that the traditional Russian mistrust of authority has made it easier for the government, because the demand for the vaccine is not as high as it would have been elsewhere. If Russia, you can get it if you wanted, but many just don't want to. Perhaps even Putin's own slowness in getting vaccinated is indicative of how cautious Russians are about this whole thing. Russia has been hit especially hard by the pandemic, with at least 250,000 epidemic linked deaths Russian officials said. But the country could now hold a powerful weapon in the fight against the virus. I think the Sputnik vaccine will be a very powerful tool. I think we still have a few questions that need to be answered. I still think we want to see the final data at the end of May when the Phase 3 trial is due to end and all of the safety data. Yes, a few small bits of data that I would like to see, but I think the Sputnik vaccine will absolutely be a very powerful tool in the global vaccine campaign, as well as many other vaccines that are both being developed right now or being used in other countries. We just need to combine that sort of manufacturing and distribution with that solid clinical evaluation, and I think that we are doing that. It's made a huge difference to Russia's image. Definitely a very good tool of soft diplomacy, which has shown that Russia has a capacity to play an important role in combating this pandemic."
"Sputnik vaccine up to 95% effective, Russia says",CBC News,2020-11-24,7Jl3Xgap-0Q,"out of Russia this morning. Trials of the Sputnik vaccine are said to be up to 95 percent effective. That's around the same figure we've heard from the candidates from Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca Oxford University. Russian officials are also touting the cost and the storage benefits of Russia's candidate. Chris Brown is our Moscow correspondent. Well, back in August, Russia was the first country in the world to announce that it had found a vaccine that works against COVID-19. But there was a lot of defying at the time because those results were based on trials involving really just a few dozen people. In the months that have gone by, Western vaccine makers have been running trials involving tens of thousands of people. And every time they would come out with a bit of good news about how well things have progressed, well, there would be Russia's Gamma-Laya Institute saying, our vaccine, which we call Sputnik V, is just a little bit better. So there has been a lot of eyeball rolling associated with Russia's efforts to develop a vaccine. But today's announcement is likely much more significant. The Gamma-Laya Institute says that they've have results from 19,000 people and that the results show it's 95 percent effective after 42 days. It's a two-shot vaccine, so you get one shot initially and then a booster a little bit later. And those results put it in the same ballpark of success as companies such as Moderna and Pfizer. In the press release, but this is the basis for the 2018. That's Karel Dmitriyev, who heads up Russia's Sovereign Wealth Fund, which is bankrolling the development of the Sputnik V vaccine, saying it's great news for Russia and also great news for the world. What's significant about Russia's vaccine is its cost, it's $20 per person, and Dmitriyev says that's about two or even three times cheaper than what Pfizer or Moderna is going to put on the market. And it's also going to make it very popular for countries that aren't, say, as rich as those in Europe, Canada, or the United States. Dmitriyev saying so far, 50 countries have already ordered 1.2 billion doses of Russia's vaccine, and those doses are going to start to go out on delivery in January. Chris Brown, CBC News, Moscow."
Sputnik V explainer: How Russia's coronavirus vaccine works,News Direct,2020-10-10,gO1F9QidILA,"The outer coating of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is covered in spike proteins that give the virus its crown-like appearance. The spike protein possesses receptor binding domains or RBDs that the coronavirus uses to pry open receptors before penetrating the cellular membrane. Sputnik-5 employs a gene with the code for the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to enter a human cell. The spike protein gene is cut from the coronavirus and inserted into a vector, a virus that is weakened so that it cannot grow inside the human body after injection. For its vectors, Sputnik-5 uses adenoviruses that cause the common cold. Two different adenoviruses, RAD-26 and RAD-5, are employed for the first and second doses to boost the effectiveness of the vaccine. The genes from these adenoviruses that cause infection are removed while the gene with the code of the spike protein is inserted. Adenoviruses are popular as vectors because they are easy to engineer. They are deemed safe because they have been with humans for thousands of years. The modified viruses should mimic a real coronavirus infection and teach the immune system to recognize COVID-19. Although they do not cause infection, the modified viruses should still trigger the body to produce antibodies that would neutralize the coronavirus. The vaccine is being developed by the Gamma-Laya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow. Russia's health ministry said on Tuesday, September 8th, that the first bash of the vaccine passed all necessary quality tests, and a country-wide COVID-19 vaccination campaign will begin next month."
The Sputnik V vaccine: A scientific and political win for Russia,FRANCE 24 English,2021-02-03,kMBtbc6Ea9g,"Sputnik V, a vaccine during the name of the first satellite launched into space back in 1957. It was a competition that put Russia ahead in the space race against the United States. And the dash to produce a COVID vaccine, Russia claimed it was also the first, but faced criticism for rushing Sputnik V into use. Now an apparent vindication. A peer-reviewed study in the British Journal, The Lancet, has confirmed the shot is 92 percent effective. And this is a very powerful result. So, the public should know this recognition of the Russian vaccine, the recognition of Russian vaccine and scientists, and the recognition of the very powerful international recognition. Vladimir Putin announced the vaccine rollout in Russia back in August, before data from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials had been published, and months before Moderna and Pfizer had announced the results of their Phase 3 trials. At the time, the United States' top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, said, I hope that the Russians have actually definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that. Twelve countries have already approved emergency use of Sputnik V, including Hungary, the only EU country to do so. Algeria has agreed to start producing the Russian vaccine in the coming weeks, after receiving its first 50,000 doses last Thursday."
One-shot Sputnik Light vaccine demonstrates 70% efficacy against infection with Delta,Sputnik V,2021-10-13,BISIcj_vpnU,"Over 250 years of Russia's leadership in vaccine development has allowed scientists to create the vaccines of the Sputnik V family. Sputnik V, which has already been authorized in 70 countries with the population of 4 billion people. And Sputnik Light, the revolutionary one-shot vaccine. Sputnik Light, the first component of Sputnik V, is a safe and approved standalone one-shot vaccine with a proven efficacy against infection of over 80 percent higher than that of most two-shot vaccines. The efficacy against hospitalization and severe disease is even higher. Sputnik Light is also a leading booster shot for people previously infected with COVID-19, also ideal for revaccinations after other vaccines. The Sputnik Light vaccine is very effective against Delta and other mutations. Its efficacy as a standalone vaccine against infection by Delta is 70 percent exceeding 75 percent in the age group below 60, higher than of most two-shot vaccines. Sputnik Light as a booster shows efficacy against Delta close to that of the Sputnik V vaccine, which is over 83 percent effective against infection and over 94 percent effective against hospitalization. A recent study in Argentina shows that Sputnik Light has a long-lasting protection, which even increases over 46 months following the vaccination, while many other vaccines showed dramatic decrease in efficacy against the Delta variant to below 50 percent within the same time period. Sputnik Light is also safe and effective in combination with other vaccines, as confirmed by joint international clinical trials. This vaccine cocktail, or mix and match approach, has been pioneered by Sputnik V. The safety and efficacy of Sputnik Light, as the first component of Sputnik V, was confirmed by real-world data from multiple countries, as well as by over 20 publications in the leading international scientific journals. Sputnik Light as the first component of Sputnik V became a significant part of the immunization program in Argentina, reducing new COVID cases by over 35 times. Sputnik Light is a safe and effective standalone one-shot vaccine and an ideal booster. Sputnik Light, a light step to freedom."
Russia's Sputnik V vaccine could be made in EU,Reuters,2021-03-09,cjYjAojwAGk,"Russia's Sputnik V vaccine could be produced in Europe for the first time, that's after a commercial deal to produce it in Italy, was signed by the Moscow-based RDIF, sovereign wealth fund, along with Swiss-based pharmaceutical company Adyen. An agreement will need approval from Italian regulators before production can be launched. It's the latest sign that some EU companies don't want to wait for the European Medicines Agency to grant approval. Scientists have said the Russian vaccine was almost 92 percent effective, based on peer-reviewed late-stage trial results. Sputnik V has already been approved or is being assessed for approval in three EU member states, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. EU officials have said Brussels could start negotiations with the vaccine maker if at least four member countries requested. The Italian Russian Chamber of Commerce said the move paved the way for the creation of the first Sputnik V production facility in Europe. But a senior EMA official last week urged EU members to refrain from approving Sputnik V while the agency is still reviewing it. That prompted the vaccine's developers to demand a public apology."
Russian President Putin says will take homemade COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V once approved,CNA,2020-12-18,qEh6zHv_Czc,"A Russian president Vladimir Putin says he hasn't taken his country's COVID-19 vaccine yet. But will do so once a Sputnik V is approved for general use. And he tilted Russia's handling of the pandemic to its mid-reports from Moscow. From his residence just outside of Moscow, Mr. Putin took questions from journalists and citizens from around the country in a press conference that lasted over four and a half hours. The Russian economy compared to the United States and some Western European countries, noting that industrial production only fell by 3.6 percent compared to some Western countries which saw a fall of nearly 9 percent. He also noted that the Russian sovereign wealth fund is as high as it's ever been, and national debt is at record lows. On the vaccine rollout, he mentioned that the vaccine production is suffering from a lack of capacity, specifically the manufacturing stage, which is failing to keep up with demand and the requirements of the Russian state. But he says the government is looking at potential solutions. What he didn't mention were the huge number of deaths due to COVID-19 reaching nearly 50,000. That's by official Russian figures. And also the 4.5 million financial casualties in terms of small businesses which have gone bankrupt during the pandemic. He touched on Western, US and Russian relations, saying that Russia has never interfered in American elections and also rubbishing the idea that Russia was engaged in the latest cyber attack on the US, which saw many government departments details leaked. He also rubbish the claim that he had anything to do with the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption politician who was poisoned in August, saying that Navalny himself is working with the United States and that the point of all of this is just destabilize Russian civil society and so discord amongst US-Russia relations. But looking forward, he laid a more optimistic tone, noting that Joe Biden was someone he would like to work with to improve Russia-US relations. And that Joe Biden has expressed an excitement about extending the new start deal, which is a weapons treaty which Mr Putin considers extremely important to Russian safety. Mr Putin even went as far as saying that Joe Biden is an experienced and professional politician. And Mr Putin, of course, himself is an experienced politician having been in the job either as President or Prime Minister for two decades. But when asked whether he was going to carry on after 2024, which the new constitution allows him to do, he said he hadn't yet decided. Stuart Smith, CNA, Moscow."
Russia's Sputnik V vaccine 91.6% effective in fighting Covid-19,FRANCE 24 English,2021-02-03,7zjCweq11ME,"At this vaccination center, east of Paris, everything is in place. The only section currently of any use, though, is the waiting area. We have been pre-used for the first February, and the pre-FaI has said that the dose was not possible. Though three vaccines have been approved in France, supply problems at European producers mean doses are rare, so attention is turning to other horizons. Russia, for one, says it's ready to send the EU 100 million doses of its Sputnik vaccine. In the meantime, because a laboratory asks for a registration of its vaccine after the European agency's emergency, it is examined. Without watching its nationality, we want it to be sure and effective. Russia says Sputnik V is 91.4 percent effective 28 days after the first injection. The country has indeed submitted its authorization request to the European Medicine Agency. Some 15 countries have already approved Sputnik V, including Argentina. But the rush to develop it meant that Russia skipped key trial phases. On Tuesday, however, British Medical Journal The Lancet published the results of an independent Phase 3 trial, suggesting a 91.6 percent effectiveness rate for Sputnik V. Another potential option, Chinese vaccines. Two are in use within China, one of which has been approved in Hungary. Chinese producers, though, have not yet requested approval by EU-wide regulators."
Russia's Sputnik Vaccine Ambitions Backfire Due To Delivery Problems,Voice of America,2021-08-06,-eqkcew4J-k,"Soon after signing an agreement with the Russian government to receive the Sputnik V vaccine, the country of Guatemala received 550,000 doses. It ordered 8 million, so the Guatemalan government cancelled the vaccine orders from Russia to buy doses made by Moderna, Piser and Johnson and Johnson. Brazil stopped buying the Sputnik V vaccine, its health regulator, and visa rejected the vaccine. Those in Argentina say the country never received millions of Sputnik doses. And on top of delivery issues, Richard Wrightinger from the Research Triangle Institute says the fact that the two doses of the vaccine are very different for the complicate the vaccination process. What the Sputnik V vaccine is, that it uses two different adenoviruses for the first shot and then the booster shot 21 days later. And essentially that means you have to produce two separate vaccines. You will have to have two different production processes, two different teams of people that produce it. And of course, very stringent quality control steps to make sure that the two are separated. The part of the problem experts say is Russia's refusal to operate within the international systems that have been set up to fight COVID. Russia has not been transparent with how it's negotiating delivery of these vaccines. So it's not operating through COVAX and World Health Organization is doing it bilaterally, country by country. And you have no idea what the arrangements or contracts or payments are for the system. And now Russia is not even able to deliver what it said it was going to deliver. So I think it's been a fiasco from start to finish. Let me say, Russian science is extraordinarily good. I want to see this vaccine succeed. But the government and the governance of this vaccine has been lacking. And you wave of COVID-19 in Russia has also affected the deliveries. To help solve the problem, Russia has signed a contract with a serum institute of India, one of the world's largest vaccine producers. But officials at the institute cannot begin producing Sputnik V until September at the earliest. You have to disaster for these countries. You have to put yourself in the position of a low income country where your people are dying, where the coronavirus and particularly with the Delta variant, it's spreading like wildfire. Their economies are going bust. Their hospitals are over full and stretched beyond capacity. And so they're clutching for any lifeline. The Russians, Sputnik vaccine was supposed to be the lifeline. Now they can't even get that. A Kremlin spokesperson insists that all the foreign contracts will be fulfilled, but they have yet to release exact dates for vaccine delivery. But in many cases, the fight against COVID is a race against time and time to wait for a vaccine, something many countries don't have. Daredegas for VOA News, Washington."
International demand for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine soars,ABC News,2021-03-02,-M8ytJZ7wD0,"Russia is making diplomatic efforts through distribution of its COVID-19 vaccine to countries who haven't been able to secure vaccines produced in the West. After first facing scrutiny on whether Russia's vaccines actually work, now the question has become whether they can meet worldwide demand. Here's ABC's Patrick Reval. Once much criticized, Russia's Sputnik V vaccine has now joined the international arsenal of vaccines to combat the pandemic. In Latin America, Sputnik V seen as a lifeline. Shipments of desperately needed doses arriving to battered countries across the region. Back in August, Russia declared it had approved the world's first COVID-19 vaccine. It was met with much skepticism. I hope that the Russians have actually definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that. And at that time, Russia hadn't. It rushed the approval process, announcing it was ready even before starting a key phase 3 trial. But in December, Russia published results of that trial. And just last month, the Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, published a peer-reviewed study showing Sputnik V is safe and over 90 percent effective. David Grout, an American living in Moscow, decided to get the vaccine. When I first heard that Russia had a vaccine last September, of course, I had my doubts. Medical technology is not one of the things you think of when you think of Russian know-how. So I was skeptical. He has now had both shots of Sputnik V. I had mild fever and body aches, sort of a chill feeling. And I also took some painkillers and the next day I was fine. But while most Russians are now eligible to get the vaccine, many are still holding off. Only around 2 percent have been inoculated. And in a recent poll, 62 percent of Russians said they don't want to get the Sputnik V vaccine. The overly hasty approval last summer partially to blame. A lot of people don't trust in Sputnik. They don't want to be vaccinated because they saw all these questions and experts concerns about vaccine, about safety and efficacy. But while there's little appetite in Russia to get the shot, the Kremlin has turned to using its vaccines as a diplomatic tool. It is not a donation. We are paying for them. But if the Russian government hadn't allowed the shipment, we would not be able to access these vaccines today. But Russia is facing a production problem as demand soars. Around 50 countries from Latin America to Asia have ordered 1.2 billion doses of the Russian vaccine. Hungary is the first European country to begin using Sputnik V, despite the European Union not yet approving it. But they haven't received close to the 600,000 doses the country was supposed to get the first month. We only got like 25 percent of the amount that was promised for the first 30 days. This week Slovakia and the Czech Republic also appealed for doses. Russia is banking on producing its vaccine elsewhere. So maybe this contracts to send a lot of millions of doses abroad, their mage, in hope that soon we will have this production. I think at the moment it's impossible, because at the moment we don't have enough vaccines even for Russia. With new variants surging in Europe and other parts of the world, the need for more vaccine is stark. The question now can Russia keep pace with the promises it's making as it continues its diplomatic efforts all over the world? Patrick Rival, ABC News. Hi everyone, George Stephanopoulos here.

Russia's Sputnik vaccine: What do we know about the Covid jab? | Q&A,The Telegraph,2021-03-31,1RPL0RTNmvQ,"The Sputnik vaccine was developed by researchers in Russia and it was named after a satellite is controversial because Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, approved the vaccine without any safety or efficacy data being published. And the Phase 3 trial hadn't even begun and the Phase 3 trials are really important because they tend to be the really big ones involving thousands of people. The Sputnik vaccine is about 91 percent effective and the AstraZeneca vaccine is about 70 percent effective. The Phase 4 vaccine was around 95 percent effective. The vaccine is based on an adenovirus vector which is the same basis that the AstraZeneca vaccine is based on and the vector means it's the way that the vaccine gets to the virus and how it sort of attacks the virus. Sputnik vaccine has two different vectors. So the first vector is given in the first dose and the second vector is given in the second dose because it's two different vectors. Scientists think that is why it's more effective than say the AstraZeneca vaccine. From the trial data there are no concerns about safety and the safety is similar to trials reported by Pfizer and Moderna and AstraZeneca. The Phase 3 trial results were published in the Lancet Medical Journal. In terms of safety there were nearly 20,000 people took part in the trial as a whole. About 14,000 had the vaccine and about just over 4,000 had the placebo. Nearly 8,000 adverse events were reported but 94 percent of those events were what is called grade 1 which would mean things like pain in your arm, maybe a slight fever, a headache, the kind of thing that a lot of people get after a vaccine anyway so they're called grade 1 and are not classed as anything to worry about and also they might not even be related to the vaccine. Russia is currently using the vaccine and several kind of Eastern European countries using it as well so Hungary has started rolling it out and the Czech Republic and Slovakia are also about to start using it and France and Germany surprisingly are also in talks with the Russians to secure their own supply and Russia has also been using its vaccine diplomacy a kind of soft power and countries in Latin America such as Argentina are also said to be using it and also some countries in Africa we don't have sort of firm reports on which countries those are. I think it's highly unlikely that the UK will use it. We've bought about 400 million doses of lots of different vaccines. We're very heavily reliant on the AstraZeneca vaccine but even if we didn't use that the AstraZeneca vaccine we still have on order about 300 million doses of other vaccines so unless something absolutely horrendous happens and all our vaccine stocks suddenly get stocked or go up and smoke then I think it's highly unlikely that we will be using this vaccine."
Europe and Russian vaccine,Dr. John Campbell,2020-09-25,aXVwkQ8qCCo,"Let's get some perspective on this story now. We have John Campbell with us. He's a health analyst and educator in Carlisle, England. Hi, John. Good to have you with us. Why do you think that we're seeing the spike in cases in regions and in countries really across Europe, not just in France? I think we're actually paying the consequences of what happened over the summertime. In summertime, the cases went down and people thought things were getting much better. So there was quite a lot of tourism. So a lot of people went on holiday to Spain, a lot of people from France went to broad and came back and that was spreading the virus around. And as well as that in summertime, as you would expect, of course, nice summer evenings, young people out drinking out socializing. And that was a major driver of infection. The infection was spreading amongst young people. But because young people usually get minimally symptomatic or even asymptomatic disease, they weren't really suffering from it themselves. But what they were doing is they were going home taking it to the parents' generation and their grandparents' generation. So what we're now seeing, as well as the increase in young people across Europe, the increase in the older people and indeed in the elderly now, which is a concern because more of these are going to get sick and some are going to potentially die, unfortunately. And John, the result is that we do know see infection levels in some regions and in some countries that are similar to those that we saw at the beginning of the pandemic. But are we better able to handle outbreaks now compared to that time? It's a very good observation. The numbers are quite similar, but testing is way better now. So we've estimated that the numbers back in February, March, April and the UK were something like 50 times underestimated. So the numbers we're getting now in reality aren't yet as high, although they appear to be on the graphs. So we're not quite back to where we were, but in terms of being better prepared, yes, of course, we are, we're massively better prepared. We've got the contact tracing apps in most countries. We've got countries, we've got data collecting facilities. People are well educated. Everyone knows about hand hygiene, face coverings, spaces between individuals. These things are well known now. The problem is motivation. There's been quite a bit of covered fatigue over the last month or two. People are just fed up of this. Understandable, of course, but the point is the virus has not gone away. 80 percent to 90 percent of the population of Europe is probably still susceptible to this virus. They can still get it. They're still relatively naive to this virus and can get it. And there's no question we can see greatly increasing cases this winter if we don't act really quite quickly. Well, John, let's take a look now at the race for the vaccine, which is ongoing. Russia was registered. It's butnik five as the world's first vaccine against the coronavirus. A lot of scientists say it is too early for widespread use. Let's take a look. Washing his hands multiple times a day, just one of a series of hygiene measures, semiangal parent undertakes. The doctor doesn't want to take any chances with coronavirus, but he knows a vaccine would offer the best protection against COVID-19. That's why he's volunteered to take part in testing a new Russian one. I think someone has to do it. Without clinical trials, there are no medicines. The effectiveness of a vaccine can only be evaluated in the third phase of clinical trials. The stage three trials began three weeks ago, but the vaccine, which has been named Sputnik five, was already licensed in August before they began. And mass inoculation in Russia is planned for later this year, something numerous experts have sharply criticized. The Russian government has rejected the criticism. It says the vaccine has been developed from already known substances and doesn't pose any health risks. Russia urgently needs an effective vaccine. The country currently has the fourth highest number of coronavirus cases worldwide, and the numbers continue to rise, with around 6,000 new infections each day. Galparen and other doctors say they're not worried about the vaccine's safety. After all, the vaccine has already been tested on several well-known public people, and they're doing well. These public figures include Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shogu, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin, and one of President Vladimir Putin's daughters, potent PR material. It's part of Russia's strategic interests to always want to be first. Irrespective of whether it's a revolution or the first flight into space, now it's about saying that we're the first to develop a vaccine. Internally, we're showing that the situation is under control. Externally, it's a signal that Russia is still mastering its role as a savior of the world. Samyan Galparen isn't thinking about his country's PR plans just now. The doctor is here because he's hoping to help win the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. People are tired. They want it to be over. The new vaccine can help calm people and offer a way out of the situation. It will most likely be at least several months until the results of the phase three trials are known. Only then can the actual effectiveness and safety of Russia's Sputnik-5 vaccine be assessed. So, John, if this vaccine were to be made available to you, would you take it? It's a very interesting question, isn't it? The answer at the moment is no. Now, this Russian vaccine is actually based on Western vaccines. It's in a Dino virus vaccine. Some people even suggest that the Russians were highly influenced by ongoing data that was being conducted and ongoing research in Western countries. So, they've developed this vaccine, and they're actually rolling it out now. Now, vaccines like any drug normally goes through three phases of clinical trials. And the phase one and the phase two clinical trials for this vaccine in Russia have been questioned by Western peer review. They're unsure about what's going on. And normally, like what we've done in the UK and in the United States, we've launched large phase three clinical trials, testing the new vaccine against another vaccine or against a placebo to see if it works in the real situation. And basically, the Russians have simply not done this. They've skipped phase three clinical trials after questionable phase one and phase two clinical trials. Now, there's two things we need to know about a vaccine. One is, does it work? And the second is, is it safe? Now, the data on the Russian vaccine indicates that it's almost certainly going to work. So, I do expect this to be efficacious. I do expect it to generate a degree of immunity. But what we're so careful about in the Western countries in Europe and the United States is making sure it's safe. And the only way we can guarantee that it's safe is by having large-scale clinical trials. So, to say it's been tested on Vladimir Putin's daughter and the mayor of Russia, you can't argue from two or three individual cases. We need large numbers of cases to demonstrate safely. And at the moment, that has not been done. So, I will be reluctant to take this vaccine. But I would certainly take one after, after, wait, after Western phase three clinical trials, however. Okay, John, this is very quickly. When do you think we can realistically expect that type of vaccine? Well, the Americans are starting to, hoping to vaccinate about 50 million people by the end of this year. Mass rollout is going to be April, May, June, July next year. So, I would expect that you and me could hopefully be vaccinated by next, early next summer is my hope. John Campbell, health, and that would work. We'll have to leave it there. Thank you so much, John. No, that's fine. Thank you. Let's get a roundup of some of the..."
Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine faces questions and hurdles overseas,CBS News,2021-05-21,epWLTmRqZFI,"Scientists and regulators are raising questions about Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. While the vaccine is already being used in multiple countries around the world, such as Argentina, Turkey and Serbia, it has still yet to win EU regulatory approval. Last month Brazil rejected the vaccine over quality, safety and efficacy concerns. Carlo Marcicelli has been following the story and is here to discuss it. He covers health care for Politico in Europe. Thanks for joining us, Carlo. I remember when Russia announced that they had a vaccine, it was very early on in the pandemic. And at least here, there are a few stories done on it. But then very quickly, I think in the US, we sort of turned away from it because there was very little information. It was clear it hadn't gone through the usual trials. And it almost appeared as if they were using their own health care people as sort of the trials. So to do the trials on this vaccine. So little did I know that other countries were using it. So give us the latest on this Sputnik vaccine use. Where is it currently being used? Sure. Well, as you mentioned, the vaccine is actually being used and has been approved by a number of different countries really all over the world. So speaking about Europe, we have hungry, Serbia, Belarus are all using the vaccine. But also in countries like South America, so Argentina has approved it. In the Middle East, the UAE, India also has approved it. So it's really being used all around the globe at the minute. So, but it has not been approved for use in Europe. Where do things stand with Europe's drug regulating agency or regulatory agency? Yeah, sure. So you're right. It hasn't been approved by the EMA, which is Europe's drug regulatory agency. Right now, the EMA is in the process of assessing the vaccine. So the Sputnik team has put in a marketing authorization application. But we don't really have any clarity on how long the EMA will take to decide whether or not to approve it. I spoke to the EMA's former boss, Guido Rossi, and he told us that in his opinion, it's going to take a while, regardless of what decision they come to. It's still going to be a little longer. So I wouldn't be expecting a decision in the short term. Okay, so let's just take a look at how the vaccine has been doing. Because obviously there are some countries that have embraced it. But it's been sort of sputtering. The Sputnik has been sputtering along in other countries. When did things first start to take a negative turn for the vaccine? And what are countries that have either rejected it or have decided to hold off on approving it? What are they saying the concerns are? Yeah, so you're exactly right. We have three regulators so far who have expressed a negative opinion on the vaccine. So first in April, we had Slovakia's medicines regulator, given negative assessment. They said that batches of the vaccine used in preclinical tests and clinical studies don't have the same characteristics and properties as batches of the vaccine that were imported to Slovakia. And they said that due to missing data, they couldn't draw a conclusion on the benefit risk ratio of the vaccine. Now, it's important to say that the government in Slovakia has decided to go ahead with distributing Sputnik anyways, because they went to experts in Hungary to examine it. And their health minister said they'd probably start distributing it in June. So that's Slovakia. Then we have the Czech Republic. Their drug regulators said in April that they also hadn't received enough data to make a decision. And most recently, we had the Brazilian regulatory authority called ANVISA and they rejected the vaccine on grounds of quality issues and because their inspectors were barred from entering certain facilities. And we don't Rosy, who again is the EMA's former boss, he said that we should take the Brazilian regulators seriously, because they're very, very well prepared and they've been working to implement the same standards that we have in the U.S. with the FDA and also in Europe with the EMA. So clearly, sort of a lack of data is an issue for some. When it comes to the actual data that has been provided, how do scientists feel about that? Are there any questions about the clinical trial results? Sure. So just a backup a little, in February, the scientists at the Gamma Leia Institute, which is the Russian State Scientific Institute that did the research for the vaccine, published in the Lancet Medical Journal clinical trial results that showed the vaccine had efficacy of over 90 percent. So that puts it in line with vaccines developed in the West, like biotech Pfizer or Moderna. However, in April, a group of scientists from all around the world published a letter in the British Medical Journal, where they laid out some of their concerns with the data. And really their concerns centered on one issue, which is they said that in certain parts of the data published in the Lancet, the data looked too uniform. So Florian Naudeg, who is a professor of therapeutics at the University of Rennen, France, and one of the scientists that signed that letter, told me that it was really one table in the Lancet article that looks just too regular with the results really falling over and over again in the 90 to 92 percent range, when really you would expect them to fall anywhere between 70 to the high 90s. So that was kind of what the concerns centered on. Oh, that's really interesting. Carlo Martitelli, we have to let you go. Thank you very much. Thank you."
European Micronation San Marino Begins Administering Russia’s Sputnik V Vaccine | NBC News NOW,NBC News,2021-03-20,U21jy9OQiIQ,"A tiny nation has just become one of the first countries in Europe to use Russia's Sputnik V COVID vaccine and it could have major geopolitical implications. NBC News Foreign Correspondent Claudia Lavanga reports now from San Marino. Aaron, while the rest of Europe is still struggling with the vaccination campaign, the tiny Republic of San Marino is on its way to immunize most of its citizens. But thanks also to the use of Sputnik V Russia's vaccine. Perched on a hill in the north of Italy, San Marino looks like a typical Italian medieval town. And yet, this tiny hamlet is an independent country in its own right. This is one of the smallest nations in the world and it claims to be the oldest surviving republic. But recently, it made headlines for another reason. It became one of the first countries in Europe to use Sputnik V Russia's vaccine to immunize its citizens against COVID-19. This Sputnik vaccine has not been authorized yet in European countries like Italy but crossed the border into San Marino and it's not a problem anymore. Even though San Marino is geographically within Italy and Europe, it's not part of the European Union. Tired of waiting for the promised Pfizer doses from Italy, the tiny state turned to Russia. San Marino and Pfizer can on the part of the... We initially made a deal with Italy, the foreign minister told NBC News, but they were delayed so we decided to take other avenues and within three weeks Russia sent the first doses. Among residents lining up to receive Sputnik V are many American passport holders. 10 percent of the population here is made of expats from the US and hold dual citizenship. Among those who have already received the Sputnik V job is PM already. She grew up in Detroit and moved here in the 1980s. I felt that it was pretty safe. Everybody told me that it was pretty safe so I was happy too. I would have preferred if it would have been American or from San Marino but hey, we take over again, right? Russia's answer to San Marino's call for vaccines also raised questions. Is San Marino a pawn in Russia's game of vaccine diplomacy? San Marino caught Russia's attention in 2014 when it did not back international sanctions for the war in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov returned the favor with an official visit in 2019. Now some see this as a way for Russia to set foot into Europe through its vaccines. Russia on the contrary giving San Marino is a clearly geopolitical move which they could do because they own the vaccine, it's a fully state vaccine, they control the production distribution. You might wonder yourself why San Marino? Because despite its very small size is an extremely visible place. It's very symbolic, it's in the heart of Europe, in the heart of Italy. And this whole situation created a lot of sympathy and also jealousy among the Italians. Myself I received those and the phone calls from Italian friends asking if they could get by chance any shot of the Sputnik in San Marino despite they're not from San Marino. Health authorities here confirmed they received hundreds of requests for Sputnik V from outside San Marino. Most of them from Italy but also France, Switzerland, Germany and from as far as Canada. It appears that after the tiny Republic of San Marino opened up to Russia's vaccine, it is the world that it's fit. If it's true that San Marino is part of Russia's big game of vaccine diplomacy, well, it's definitely paying off. Now more than 50 countries around the world are using the Russian vaccine and now both Italy and the European Union are speeding up. It's a approval process."
Russia's Sputnik V Is Great Vaccine: RDIF CEO,Bloomberg Television,2020-12-29,LDQI46tzQDE,"It's a big day for you guys. You also just recently mentioned that Venezuela will get a spot in the V. Argentina is getting their first shot today. The administration starts today to distribute it. How quickly can you get these doses to Venezuela? Well, I think we can get some already in January. And as you mentioned, Argentina is very important because vaccination started today. There is huge demand from Latin America. And we will be trying to get as many doses as we can, starting from January to some of the key nations in Latin America. And that will increase and supply more in February and March for countries that have not worked with us before. We can only start supplying in March of next year. When does Argentina, for example, get the second shot? There's been a lot of questions in the market as to sort of where that shot was made, where it's coming from. And if you have enough to satisfy, say, Russian demand as well as these other countries. Of course we do. So they will get the second shot on schedule, which is, you know, in January and we will basically go exactly as with the schedule that we agreed with them. And of course, Russia is vaccinating Russians, but we are also working with a number of nations who understand the benefit of our vaccine, which is proven safe platform of human denovirus and high efficacy. So we will be supplying them, of course, on schedule. So does that mean that the shots are being made somewhere else? Because I thought that officials said that the Sputnik V won't be sent abroad before Russians get their vaccines. Well, we actually have great four companies in Russia who are manufacturing Sputnik Vyvek scene, but we also set a partnership to manufacture Sputnik in Brazil, India, Korea, and China and some other nations. So today is actually a good day for us. We received the first batch manufactured in Korea. So we have set up manufacturing based to produce more than 500 million doses, people doses next year. In U.S., you call it one billion doses because you count one people dose as two doses. So basically, we have a big supply base outside of Russia that will be supplied, supply and markets outside of Russia. I see. Okay. There's also been some reports that not a lot of Russia necessarily wants to take the Sputnik Vyvek scene. How many people have been vaccinated there and how do you get them to want to get the shot? Well, first of all, lots of people do want to get the shot. You know, our estimate is, and we did the survey, that most 42 percent of the people would like to get vaccinated, you know, near term. And this is similar as in many other nations, which is about 50-50. We believe that as people see empirical evidence that their neighbors have good immunity, you know, the numbers will increase. But again, lots of people want to get vaccinated in Russia. And there is just very negative narratives that some of the Western media are trying to portray about Russian vaccination, Russian vaccine, that is just done for geopolitical reasons. Lurenkliy is highly unethical. And the real narrative is, we have a great vaccine and we will be a major player in vaccines and we'll be saving lots of lives in Russia and outside of Russia already is this year. So it does the case, then, why won't you get published peer review data? Well, first of all, we did publish phase one and phase two in the Lancet magazine. We will publish phase three in a top peer review at magazine. I think in the next two, three weeks and the data has already been submitted. And basically, we have full transparency. It's another part of fake narratives that some of the Western media are portraying. We will publish our protocol of studies. We have done studies on 31,000 people. We've done clinical studies in UE, India, you know, Venezuela, Belarus. So this is just part of the fake false narratives that is propagated by people who want to contain Russia. And we actually want to be partners. And you know how AstraZeneca deal you mentioned as an example, where we showed that one of our components would be useful to AstraZeneca vaccine and be offered the right way. So I think time will tell and time will show that we have a vaccine that is very safe, very efficient. We don't need minus 70 degrees for our vaccine. It's plus two plus eight. And it will be a major solution for many countries in the world. I mean, there was a levada poll that was published this week that said that only 38 percent of Russians want to get that vaccine. Do you think that that poll is totally made up then? Well, no, you said 38 percent, our poll showed 42 percent. So those are closed numbers. But again, it's very clearly that you see and you will see in January as well. Our vaccine is demanded by many people around the world. In Russia, people are being vaccinated. We have lots of people vaccinated. You know, I myself also got vaccinated. So, you know, we just said that we see and you sort of sense a little bit in your question, the sort of said narrative trying to portray the competitive reasons Russian vaccine in a negative way. And what we should really do is to blind wine taste of the vaccines. And if you do blind wine taste and you see that we have much safer track record, we have better price than many vaccines. We have plus two plus eight. And very importantly, we believe that our shot because we use two different factors for delivery will last longer. So, if you have blind white taste in a vaccine, sputnik wins. And this will be very clear to many nations. But once again, we want to cooperate with other vaccines. We will announce a major vaccine partnership with the Chinese manufacturer in the next couple of weeks as well. So we are setting this trend of cooperating and cooperation between different vaccine producers."
"Sputnik V: 'We want the vaccine to not be political,' Kirill Dmitriev says",FRANCE 24 English,2021-03-03,D2hPgqTTWVU,"Sputnik V, we are joined by Karel Demetriyev, he is the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund that financed the development of Sputnik V. He joined us for a Moscow. Thanks for joining us, sir. Thank you. First of all, can I get your reaction to the news that Slovakia, as of yesterday, is buying doses of Sputnik V? Well, I think it's very important news. It shows that Slovakian government, Slovakian Prime Minister really cares about his people and he's chosen one of the three vaccines in the world with Africa. He's more than 90 percent and he understands that the real choice, there is no choice. He needs to protect his people and there is a fake choice that is being tried to be put by some of the people in you, you know, you use solidarity or Sputnik, but this is a fake choice. The real choice is we need to use different vaccines that work to protect people in different countries and this is only decision. Why is that a fake choice, as you say, by the EU, given that the European Medicines Agency has yet to give the green light to Sputnik V? Well, EU clarified that Hungary completely follows the procedures that exist. Slovakia did as well, so EU members can and have a right to do so. And as you mentioned, Czech Republic and some other countries, I think, in about this. And secondly, we did apply for EMA approval. We are working very closely with the EMA. We hope rolling review starts. We see that there is big pharma lobby, as it tries to prevent Sputnik from, you know, being in Europe, but we want to come pharma lobby down. We are not going to be a huge play in Europe. All we can do for now is to provide 50 million doses in Q2, Q3 of this year. And that is not going to be a decisive factor, but it is going to be an important factor to have people vaccinated earlier. Do you think then this is a sort of political decision by the EU to not give the green light to Sputnik V when it has done to AstraZeneca and Pfizer? Well, first of all, we actually see great support from President Macron. And he sent his great team to Russia, headed by Marie Polkini, who is great and they are working with us almost 24 hours a day. We also have great support from Chancellor Merkel, who gave us an early institute and they are working with us as well. So I think we have lots of European leaders who understand that they need to have many different vaccines. And by the way, we also partner with AstraZeneca. But we also see a big lobby from some big pharma companies that are trying to slow-sputnik down and try to spread different rumors that are false about it. We applied for a meeting. We can give 50 million doses and we want the vaccine to be not political. I think this is one of the non-political bridges Russia and Europe can really have together. Well, you know, Sputnik V has at least in the past come under some criticism because of a lack of transparency because mass vaccinations began in Russia before the results of phase three trials were released. Why did Russia do that? And do you understand there for why there has been some hesitancy about Sputnik V? Well, first of all, I think all of those questions have really been answered by the Lancet article. They showed more than 90 percent efficacy and really is its Sputnik is vaccine for the world. No, not a platform of human and a viral vector, incredibly efficient, you know, can be stored plus two plus eight and it's very affordable. And if you see what Russia has done, you know, many people forget that Pfizer and Moderna, their phase three will be finished in the next couple of years. So phase three trials are not complete. What are they vaccines? Are people to protect our high-risk groups in September or so already, and we knew it safe and efficient and we proved it with the Lancet article. And now it's registered in more than 40 countries in the world. There's been lots of concern recently about various mutations of coronavirus in your understanding or based on the research on Sputnik V. Is it effective against some of these mutations we're seeing from South Africa from the United Kingdom? Yeah, definitely. So we proved the efficiency of Sputnik exact the same efficacy with the UK mutation and we can publish this data in the next hopefully a couple of weeks and there have been also good results on the South African variant. And by the way, this is why we believe Sputnik is so important because it uses two different shots and that makes it more prone to mutations and other vaccines that use the same shot for two different shots of vaccine. But we will publish this data hopefully in March and shows that Sputnik is very effective against mutations because of the way it was designed. We believe it is specifically designed to be very effective against mutations. Just finally, you touched on the idea that Sputnik V may work with the developers of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Tell us how that might happen in practice. Will you not be a rival with other pharmaceutical companies, but effectively working in coordination to vaccinate as many people as possible? Well, Baker, I think that's a great point because basically it's important to understand we pioneered this approach called Heterogeneous Boosting. It sounds very technical, but you use two different shots. And basically with AstraZeneca, we already started clinical trials, which will be AstraZeneca shot and Sputnik shot. And we can do the same with other vaccine makers. And we believe this approach of using two different shots will actually increase efficacy of vaccines. So we have an official collaboration with AstraZeneca and hope actually to extend it to us as a vaccine makers and believes that vaccine makers should work together with huge demands of all four vaccines. And only by working together can we overcome the pandemic. All right, Karil Demetri of the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund that has paid for the research into Sputnik V. Thank you very much indeed for talking to us. Thank you."
DOH: Side effects of Sputnik V similar to other vaccines,INQUIRER.net,2021-05-05,EOWhf6PPOpo,"How many experience side effects from Sputnik so far? What kind are they? Any different from the side effects of Sinopharm and AstraZeneca? Based on the studies of the vaccine expert panel, side effects of sputnik would be the pain in the inoculation site. They are generally safe based on their evaluation."
SPUTNIK V VACCINE || SIDE EFFECTS || HOW IT WORKS || DETAILED INFORMATION,Medicoverse,2021-06-26,9iVtSE1Fzzs,"Hey guys, welcome back to the channel, hope you guys are doing good. In this video, I will tell you guys about another vaccine being used for COVID-19, developed in Russia. That is Putnik V. So without wasting any more time, let's get started. Before talking anything else about the vaccine, let me tell you what does the V in the name of the vaccine denoted. This signifies victory over COVID-19, according to the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund. Place of Development The vaccine was developed by the Gameria Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia. Talking about the type of vaccine, Putnik V is an Edinovirus viral vector vaccine. Technology used. So Putnik V is a viral to vector vaccine based on two human Edinoviruses containing the gene that encodes for the full length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to stimulate an immune response. The two zero types of the Edinoviruses used are AD-26 and AD-5. We will understand it's better by discussing about the dose of the vaccine. Putnik V is a two-shot vaccine, where the difference of the time between the first and the second shot is 21 days. Basically, in the first shot of the vaccine, the zero type of the Edinovirus used is AD-26. The second shot of the vaccine that is taken after 21 days has the zero type AD-5 as a booster. Talking about the age of beneficiaries, Putnik V coronavirus vaccine has proven equally effective for all age groups, according to Alexander Ginsburg, the head of Gameria Research Institute. Now, let us discuss about the administration of the vaccine. Putnik V is an intramuscular vaccine. That means it needs to be injected at an angle of 90 degrees in the delta-admossal. This is the site of injection for the vaccine. Efficacy and Side Effect The Gameria National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology and the Russian Direct Investment Fund RDIF have reported that Putnik V COVID-19 vaccine showed a 97.6 percent efficacy. And some of the common side effects include flu-like illness, headache, fatigue and pain at the site of injection. That is it for today guys.

Sputnik (Gamaleya) and Coronavac (Sinovac) vaccines,Komoto Family Foundation,2021-02-18,GNWSU7g_oEw,"Hi everyone, Dr. Kalikoh here and I promised you a video in which I would discuss both the Sputnik vaccine as well as the coronavirus vaccine. So to start off the Sputnik vaccine, this is the one developed by Gamalaya in Russia. They recently published their phase three clinical trial results in the Lancet which is a peer-reviewed medical journal and this vaccine is currently available in Russia and either currently or soon to be available in India and Nepal, Egypt, Iran, Latin America and many other countries. So based on these published results, these are interim results meaning it's kind of like a sneak preview so they've published some results ahead of time but there's more to come. So they included 20,000 adults in these clinical trials and it's a two-dose regimen. So these results, these interim results are reflecting the effectiveness after the first dose. So what they found is that the Sputnik vaccine is 92 percent effective in preventing symptomatic COVID disease and it's 100 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe COVID disease. So that's great news. Also they included over 2,000 adults who were over the age of 60 and the effectiveness in this group of elders was 92 percent. So that's also good news for the segment of our population that is most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease. So we expect to see more results probably after that second dose in future publications. Overall the vaccine appeared to be well tolerated. The most common sight effects were flu-like symptoms and pain at the injection site so very similar to the other vaccines that we've discussed in previous videos. There were no deaths or serious sight effects that were attributed to the vaccine. So this was monitored by an independent safety monitoring committee. This means these are scientists who are not employed by the pharmaceutical company that is sponsoring the trial and they determine none of the serious events were attributed to the vaccine. So one of the main limitations of this particular trial is that all of the patients who were enrolled happen to be based out of Moscow. So big city that means we don't know how generalizable the results might be to people who would be living in more rural areas for example. Also the trial population was 99 percent white so again limited generalizability to people of color but overall that's what we know about the Sputnik vaccine. Now on the coronavirus vaccine so this is the one developed by Sinovac based in China. This one's available in China, Brazil, Turkey and several other countries. And on this vaccine we have only press release data. We have not seen any full published Phase 3 clinical trial results in a peer reviewed medical journal yet. And what we know based on the press releases is that they included 25,000 participants in Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and Chile. And this is also a two-dose regimen. So the effectiveness of this vaccine ranges anywhere from 50 percent in Brazil to 91 percent in Turkey. And we're not clear on how exactly that primary end point was defined whether that's symptomatic COVID like most of the other trials or something else. So I hope to see you know more detailed results published in a peer reviewed journal. It does appear to be tolerated well tolerated from a safety standpoint as well. But yeah again if we and let until we see the full results in a medical journal it really is difficult to be able to make apples to apples, fair comparisons between this vaccine and the other manufacturers. So the other point I want to address is some of the rhetoric that I've been reading in the news and hearing in the news and social media about maybe some mistrust that people have about the vaccines that have been developed by Sinovac and Gamalaya. And I want to make a point that it's really important for us to distinguish between the pharmaceutical companies, the government policies of these countries and the people who are from these countries. So those are all different things. And the reason I'm bringing this up is because I'm going to give you one example of a news article I read in NPR where they interviewed a vaccine researcher based out of the US and he's talking about the Sinovac vaccine and he says it's science by press release the Chinese are being well characteristically less than transparent. Can you see what's wrong with that statement right there? So what he's doing is over generalizing you know the opacity maybe or the the fact that we haven't seen full clinical trial results he's generalizing that to the Chinese people. So there's a problem with that because when you start to blur those lines between the people who live in a country and maybe the government regime that's in control at any given moment or you know you start to really perpetuate these racist and xenophobic stereotypes. So it's fair to criticize government policies. It's fair to criticize pharmaceutical companies when they're not sharing detailed data that they could be sharing or maybe should be sharing with the public but what we don't do is over generalize that to the people. So I just want to make that point clear. So that's it for this video and in a future video what I'm going to do is take you behind the scenes to show you what goes on in preparation for a mass vaccination clinic. So stay tuned for that and if you want to be notified when that video's available be sure you subscribe to the YouTube channel. Thanks."
Slovaks divided over Russia's Sputnik V vaccine after quality concerns,euronews,2021-05-01,DLSvgr-to4o,"Among slow-vegs, the Russian Sputnik V-vex scene is much more popular than in other central eastern European countries and new studies shows. And yet for two months now, hundreds of thousands of Sputnik V-viles have been waiting in practice level for the use to be authorized. Barbaradayak studies English and German in the Slovak capital. She doesn't care whether the vaccine comes from the West or the East. I would choose Sputnik. I would choose the Russian one. Because of the side effects, I heard it had a lot of side effects, the AstraZeneca. But I haven't really heard anything about Sputnik. The study shows 15 percent of slow-vegs would choose the Russian vaccine, three times the average for central and eastern Europe. Such positive preference is connected to positive preference of Russia among slow-vegs. 78 percent of slow-vegs perceive Russia as their brother nation. Many slow-vegs do not perceive Russia as a threat. The Western oriented NGO Globesek not only asked the population, but also observed the online campaigns of the vaccine manufacturers. Their conclusion, the slow-veg Twitter account of Sputnik is a proper gander machine with the aim of discrediting the slow-veg authorities according to the researchers. The Russians have accused our medical authorities of the act of sabotage. They claim that they breached the treaty, which is not true. The slow-veg Prime Minister had to resign after purchasing the Sputnik vaccines despite the opposition of his coalition partners. The new head of government and his health minister are now waiting for further test results from Hungary. Then, a decision will be made again on whether to approve the Russian vaccine. The results are awaited as agreed. A few months ago, Slovakia had one of the highest COVID-19 death rates in the world. After that, the number of people who want to get vaccinated doubled. Today, most Slovakians are less interested in political controversies around Sputnik V. They just want the vaccination program to be faster. Johannes Blaschberger, Urenews, Bratislava."
I decided to take the Sputnik vaccine - but is it safe?,The Independent,2021-01-12,CWXn0EHGERg,"Sputnik, a shorthand for Cold War competition. V, well, that's for victory of course. From the moment Vladimir Putin fired his own Finnish gun and licensed the world's first COVID vaccine in August. Before it had been tested in a large-scale clinical trial, the Kremlin star has been closely aligned to Sputnik's orbit. Moscow has promoted its vaccine all over the world. Many would say a little too enthusiastically. When the pharmaceutical group Pfizer reported preliminary results suggesting their vaccine had 90 percent efficacy. Two days later Sputnik's backers said theirs was 92. When Moderna reported 94 percent, that figure went up to 95. Science being molded to suit the politics? Perish the thought. In December, just as the British began their mass vaccination campaign, Russia's health authorities under pressure from the Kremlin hastily started theirs. We're already nearly a month into that programme. Officially, anyone in a high risk group can receive the job already. But according to local media, the uptake has been underwhelming. And unofficially, clinics have been opening their lists to anyone who wants it. Now in the name of journalism and my own absence of unity, I decided I'd give the thing a go myself. And a little while ago I called the clinic behind me and they said they would make me eligible for the programme. Am I nervous? No. I don't have all the papers I need, but that doesn't seem to be a problem. Weirdly for Russia. I'm asked a few questions, whether I'm happy with the risks. I think I am. And ten minutes later, I'm one of just two patients taking the freshly deferostin vaccine. I asked my fellow vaccine volunteer if we were fools to be taking the Sputnik vaccine before the end of trials. The next few days on Sputnik are rough, headaches, temperatures, my pulse racing, breathing all over the place. But by day four, things are mostly back to normal and I'm in altogether happier cosmonaut. It's still a bit too early to check antibody levels. Those are still negative a week in. But in the scheme of things given that I'm unlikely to be at the front of the Q back home in the UK, I feel in a pretty privileged position. So, is the criticism of Sputnik unfair? Well, we know by now it seems to provide some level of immunity to some people. For how long, we don't know. But just about any vaccine falls in that category. In terms of safety, again, we really don't have the full data set. But the viral vector technology used in Sputnik, that isn't new. It's been used before in the Ebola vaccine. And the basic signs of it dates back to Soviet research conducted in the 1970s and 80s. That was a time of scientific excellence for Russia, when Soviet verology was a world leader alongside the United States. Virologist Michael Favorev was one of tens of thousands of scientists who left Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He says a few good scientists stayed behind in research facilities like the Gamma-Leyes Centre that developed Sputnik. But the standards aren't quite as rigorous as they once were. But would you, I mean, would you advise if a Russian has the chance to take it? It might be not, of course, 94 percent of the Russian claim. Who cares what they claim? But it's even 50 percent just do it. You know, what you're thinking about. That's what my position. I'm not support of this vaccine. I'm not enthusiastic of this vaccine. But I'm enthusiastic of saving people's lives. Even with an official admission that Russia's COVID-19 death toll may be three times that previously disclosed, with most of winter still to come, Russians are skeptical about Sputnik. Authorities say between 50 and 800,000 of them have already been vaccinated. Those wildly varying figures depend on who exactly you're talking to. According to a recent poll, only 38 percent of Russians said they would be prepared to take Sputnik. In late December, Vladimir Putin's spokesman announced the president himself would soon receive the job, an attempt to lend credibility to the vaccine he has so enthusiastically promoted. But if he's having such difficulty persuading his own citizens to take Sputnik, he'll have his work cut out selling it to the rest of the world."
Sputnik V story episode 2 “Sputnik V vaccine safe transportation”,Sputnik V,2020-11-27,ciPqC2AMzj0,"Hi, I'm Dadia and we're here in the laboratories of the Gamma Lee Institute in Moscow. This is the place where the first registered COVID-19 vaccine Spudnikvy was developed. This is where the Spudnikvy story began. The world is struggling to deal with the effects of the pandemic. All in countries with greatly varying climates all need access to the Spudnikvy vaccine. Spudnikvy can be delivered to all corners of the globe without a risk of it being spoiled in transit. This is one of its advantages over some other coronavirus vaccines. So how do we ensure the safe distribution of the vaccine? Currently there are two forms of the Spudnikvy vaccine, the liquid form which is stored in the frozen state and a powder version which can be stored at plus 4 degrees centigrade. A third form, a variation of the liquid formulation of the vaccine can also be stored at plus 4 degrees centigrade and is being considered as an option for future use. So what does the transportation process for Spudnikvy look like? After the vaccine has been produced and added to a vial, it is placed in a refrigerated room which has a temperature of between minus 16 and minus 25 degrees centigrade, where the vaccine is stored before use. In order to transport the vaccine, have it duty and airtight boxes are used, which enables low temperatures to be maintained for long periods of time. The temperature is monitored through the use of special sensors. Once on board, the vaccine can be safely delivered to any remote location in the world. Spudnikvy has the ability to protect people from the COVID-19 infection across all areas of the world. Follow Spudnikvy's story in social networks. Share and repost. Stay safe.

Russia's Sputnik V Vaccine is Proving Doubters Wrong,Bloomberg Quicktake,2021-02-08,HnvVRdatNEI,"With more on Sputnik 5, it's Bloomberg Intelligence, a senior pharmaceutical analyst. Sam Fizzelli, hey, Sam, thanks so much for being here. Countries right now lining up for supplies of Sputnik 5. So how did this go from facing strong skepticism back in August to becoming a favorite for European countries? Yeah, well, you know, I think that there's always a little bit of skepticism when it comes to a vaccine from China or a vaccine from Russia for whatever reason, prejudice or whatever it is. You know, we had longer, I think, felt that there was no reason to be skeptical until we had seen the data. You know, you judge when you see the data and when we saw the data, it looked, obviously, as you've highlighted, fine, based on the details that we've seen. Obviously, it's the data that's been published in a journal. It's not like when you get the FDA doing a review of, say, the Pfizer-BioNTech or the vaccine, which goes on for like seven or eight hours and you get a very detailed analysis of the data. But it's still a good step forward and I don't necessarily doubt it. Why is it better than AstraZeneca? I think it's very tough to do these cross trial comparisons. So do we know for sure that it's better at this point? I mean, do we have enough data? No, you do not know for sure that any vaccines better than another one unless they've been compared head to head. Demographic differences, time differences, what's going on with the variants in different countries, and of course, the latest data from AstraZeneca showed that with the 12-week or longer time difference between the two doses, you've got a much better efficacy in the region of 18-90 percent. I think it was 84 percent exactly. OK, so we went through some numbers here. $20 for a two-shot regimen, making it cheaper than the mRNA vaccines. We also went over just the fact that it's easier to store because it doesn't have to be kept as cold as those. What does that sort of accessibility mean in the fight against the global pandemic? Yeah, obviously, it means a lot because I'm pretty sure that anybody who wants to can really go ahead and give themselves freezers and deal with that problem. But if you don't have to, it's much easier, much better. Everyone's better refrigerator. Well, that's not quite right, but most medical places have good refrigerators, and they should be able to cope with that. I have to say, though, that price isn't particularly cheap when you compare it to some of the prices we've heard for AstraZeneca. So it's not necessarily the cheapest vaccine, but it's certainly less expensive or lower price versus price of biotic and Moderna. What we've heard with the mRNA vaccines, at least here in the United States, is that, look, they're producing this vaccine as quickly as possible. What do we know about Russia's ability to actually produce the Sputnik V vaccine at a rate that will satisfy growing demand? Yeah, so that I can't really answer because I don't know the details. I think I listened to the press conference sometime last week and they said that they can manufacture. Let's not forget, though, this is two different viruses. This is not the same vaccine twice in two doses. One of them uses the AstraZeneca, sorry, the Johnson Johnson type of virus called the Novirus 36. The second shot uses Novirus 5, which is similar to the one that can sign or has used. You've seen, or will you, but at least heard, the efficacy levels being spoken about for that one, which is in the region of just over 50 percent, 60 percent. It's not as simple as that. I'm not convinced that necessarily is that easy as you've seen. They've all had issues. You can't just assume that if you take the cells that make the virus from one laboratory or one manufacturer's suite to another manufacturer's suite, it would behave exactly the same. Is absolutely not guaranteed. Sam, is this the type of vaccine that could potentially come to the United States? Why not? If the United States needs it, but I don't see the need. You've got Pfizer-High-outs, you've gotten Moderna, you've got Johnson and Johnson just filed, which is a similar technology. You've got Novavax coming, which is yet another different technology. I don't see the US needing this. You mentioned there's always skepticism around Chinese and Russian vaccines. Would you take this? Yeah, look, if I had to, yes, I would take it. I've said that in what I've written. I'm not sure whether I would want to take the sign-of-back vaccine or the consign-of-vaccine given the efficacies of seeing. If I had the trace between those three, I would definitely take the Russian one, knowing what I know today, not obviously the detail of side effects, etc. All right. There you have it. Bloomberg Intelligence, a senior pharmaceutical analyst, Sam Fiselli. Hey, Sam. I hope you join us. Thanks so much for your time."
"Covid-19 vaccines: Sinopharm, Pfizer, Moderna, Oxford and Sputnik explained",The National News,2020-12-11,X_tCe1pdAz8,"Globally, more than 200 coronavirus vaccines are at various stages of development. About 10 are in phase 3 trials, meaning they're being tested on a large number of people in different regions and countries. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use a new method involving mRNA. It involves injecting a tiny amount of the virus's genetic code, which trains a person's immune system to fight the COVID-19 virus if they come into contact with it. One of the major differences between the two is that the Pfizer vaccine, which has given in two doses, three weeks apart, has to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. Whereas the Moderna vaccine, given in two doses, four weeks apart, can be stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius. No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved for use in humans. The vaccine collaboration between AstraZeneca and Oxford University is based on a more traditional method. By using a common-called virus from chimpanzees, modified to carry the COVID-19 genetic information and prevent infection in humans, it causes the immune system to produce COVID-19 antibodies. This approach has been used to create effective vaccines for diseases including Ebola and flu. It is given in two doses and can be stored in a standard fridge. The Sputnik vaccine is named after the Soviet era satellite that triggered the space race and is designed to prompt an immune system response after two doses given 21 days apart. Similar in design to the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, it uses two viral vectors, essentially the means to deliver genetic material into cells that normally cause the comma cold and carries the genetic code of COVID-19. Tryna's sign of farm vaccine, which has been approved for use in the UAE, is an inactivated vaccine, meaning it uses dead or weakened versions of the virus. It works by exposing the body's immune system to the disease without causing serious illness. The technique has been used for decades to create many vaccines, including for polio. During the Phase III trials in the UAE, the sign of farm vaccine was administered to volunteers in two doses over 28 days. It stored in the fridge between two and eight degrees Celsius. So how did the vaccines compare so far? Moderna and Pfizer have both recorded efficacy protection rates of 95 percent during trials. With Sputnik 92 percent effective, the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine ups to 90 percent effective, and the sign of farm vaccine registering 8-6 percent efficacy rates according to the UAE. We have to immunize at least 70 percent of the population and given that most of these vaccines have two doses, we are talking about 11 billion doses to be distributed throughout the world in every corner. With a lot of challenges, there are countries which are politically unstable, there are countries where are to reach, there are other issues that need to be tackled before we can really look onto the extreme positive impact of these vaccines on to ending this pandemic. Just putting into the perspective, we have a very excellent vaccine against measles virus, against polio viruses, but just because of the distribution challenges, those are not yet been delivered to the corner of the world where it need to be declared as eradicated. And primarily because of the logistic challenges, many general challenges and sometimes very political challenges. So therefore, I am thinking that what happened is that the guess challenge after the availability of the vaccine would be to take it to the scale where it is needed to really see the impact of the vaccine to curtail the pandemic. The challenge of developing a COVID-19 vaccine may be drawing to a close, but what remains to be seen is how long immunity will last. Lockdowns and other restrictions put in place by government aim to prevent more people from becoming infected and dying. But scientists say successful vaccines will ultimately be the key to helping end the pandemic."
Sputnik V: Russia says allegations coronavirus vaccine is unsafe are 'groundless',Guardian News,2020-08-12,Zkfy5w6-6dQ,"Foreign experts, who, driven by a sense of competition and the competitive advantages of the Russian drug, have made some opinions that are absolutely unfounded as of December of this year. Indeed, many countries have used various vaccines, each with its own benefits and limitations. However, Russian vaccines, as I have said before, are based on solid scientific knowledge and data. We understand that the studies and clinical trials of these vaccines confirm a positive balance between their benefits and risks. In other words, the risk from vaccination is significantly lower than the risk of contracting the coronavirus and the consequences of the disease caused by this infection."
How Gamaleya Sputnik V Covid-19 Vaccine Works,HealthyRN Ways,2021-03-05,fOxd5ocicHE,"How Gamma Leia's COVID-19 Vaccine Works The Gamma Leia Research Institute, part of Russia's Ministry of Health, developed a coronavirus vaccine known as Sputnik V or Gamma COVID-VAC. Gamma Leia published a study in February 2021 showing the vaccine had an efficacy rate of 91.6 percent. Russia is using it in a mass vaccination campaign, and it is now being distributed in Argentina, Belarus and other countries. This series of race to vaccine for COVID-19 brought to you by healthy RN ways. Videos will be posted every Monday, Wednesday and Friday about the whole COVID-19 pandemic from the start until the end of this pandemic. Please see my other videos about COVID-19 vaccines available now, click the link at the end of this video. A piece of the coronavirus the SARS-CoV-2 virus is studied with proteins that it uses to enter human cells. These so-called spike proteins make attempting target for potential vaccines and treatments. Sputnik V is based on the virus's genetic instructions for building the spike protein. But unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which store the instructions in single-stranded RNA, Sputnik V uses double-stranded DNA. DNA inside adenoviruses the researchers developed their vaccine from adenoviruses, a kind of virus that causes colds. They added the gene for the coronavirus spike protein gene to two types of adenovirus, one called ad 26 and one called ad 5, and engineered them so they could invade cells but not replicate. Sputnik V comes out of decades of research on adenovirus-based vaccines. The first one was approved for general use last year, a vaccine for Ebola, made by Johnson and Johnson. Some other coronavirus vaccines are also based on adenoviruses, such as one from Johnson and Johnson using ad 26, and one by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca using a chimpanzee adenovirus. Entering a cell after Sputnik V is injected into a person's arm, the adenoviruses bump into cells and latch onto proteins on their surface. The cell engulfs the virus in a bubble and pulls it inside. Once inside, the adenovirus escapes from the bubble and travels to the nucleus, the chamber where the cells DNA is stored. The adenovirus pushes its DNA into the nucleus. The adenovirus is engineered so it can't make copies of itself, but the gene for the coronavirus spike protein can be read by the cell and copied into a molecule called messenger RNA, or mRNA. Building spike proteins the mRNA leaves the nucleus, and the cells molecules read its sequence and begin assembling spike proteins. Some of the spike proteins produced by the cell form spikes that migrate to its surface and stick out their tips. The vaccinated cells also break up some of the proteins into fragments, which they present on their surface. These protruding spikes and spike protein fragments can then be recognized by the immune system. The adenovirus also provokes the immune system by switching on the cells alarm systems. The cell sends out warning signals to activate immune cells nearby. By raising this alarm, Sputnik V causes the immune system to react more strongly to the spike proteins. Spotting the intruder when a vaccinated cell dies, the debris contains spike proteins and protein fragments that can then be taken up by a type of immune cell called an antigen presenting cell. The cell presents fragments of the spike protein on its surface. When other cells called helper T cells detect these fragments, the helper T cells can raise the alarm and help marshal other immune cells to fight the infection. Making antibodies other immune cells, called B cells, may bump into the coronavirus spikes on the surface of vaccinated cells, or free floating spike protein fragments. A few of the B cells may be able to lock onto the spike proteins. If these B cells are then activated by helper T cells, they will start to proliferate and pour out antibodies that target the spike protein. Stopping the virus the antibodies can latch onto coronavirus spikes. Mark the virus for destruction and prevent infection by blocking the spikes from attaching to other cells. Killing infected cells the antigen presenting cells can also activate another type of immune cell called a killer T cell to seek out and destroy any coronavirus infected cells that display the spike protein fragments on their surfaces. Two doses some researchers worry that our immune systems could respond to an adenovirus vaccine by making antibodies against it, which would render a second dose ineffective. To avoid this, the Russian researchers used one type of adenovirus, add 26, for the first dose, and another, add 5, for the second. Adenovirus-based vaccines for COVID-19 are more rugged than the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. DNA is not as fragile as RNA, and the adenovirus's tough protein coat helps protect the genetic material inside. As a result, Sputnik V can be refrigerated and does not require very low storage temperatures. Remembering the virus Gamma-Layer has announced that Sputnik V has an efficacy rate of 91.4 percent, but has not yet published a scientific paper with the full details of the trial. It's not yet clear how long the vaccine's protection might last. The level of antibodies and killer T cells triggered by the vaccine may drop in the months after vaccination. But the immune system also contains special cells called memory B cells and memory T cells that may retain information about the coronavirus for years or even decades. Clinical trials before the start of clinical trial the vaccine had gone through all stages of pre-clinical trials with experiments on different types of animals, including two types of primates. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the vaccine have been completed on August 1, 2020. All the volunteers are feeling well. No unforeseen or unwanted side effects were observed. The vaccine induced strong antibody and cellular immune response. Not a single participant of the current clinical trials got infected with COVID-19 after being administered with the vaccine. The high efficacy of the vaccine was confirmed by high precision tests for antibodies in the blood serum of volunteers, including an analysis for antibodies that neutralize the coronavirus, as well as the ability of the immune cells of the volunteers to activate in response to the spike-est protein of the coronavirus, which indicates the formation of both antibody and cellular immune vaccine response. Post-registration clinical trials involving more than 31,000 people in Russia and Belarus were launched on August 25, 2020. A number of countries, such as UAE, India and Venezuela joined the clinical trials of Sputnik V locally. The vaccine has received a registration certificate from the Russian Ministry of Health on August 11 and under emergency rules adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used to vaccinate the population in Russia. In Phase 3 clinical trials, Sputnik V showed strong efficacy, immunogenicity and safety results. Effecacy of Sputnik V against COVID-19 was reported at 91.6 percent. The figure is based on the analysis of data on 19,866 volunteers, who received both the first and second doses of the Sputnik V vaccine or placebo at the final control point of 78 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Sputnik V provides full protection against severe cases of COVID-19. Sputnik V guarantees robust humoral antibodies which are first line of defense and cell mediated long-term protection immune response. The Phase 3 clinical trial results proved high levels of safety and immunogenicity of the Sputnik V vaccines including elderly group. Over 98 percent of volunteers in the vaccine group developed humoral immune response and 100 percent cellular immune response. The level of virus neutralizing antibodies of volunteers vaccinated with Sputnik V is 1.3x1. 5x times higher than the level of antibodies of patients who recovered from COVID-19. Vaccine efficacy for the elderly group was shown at 91.8 percent and did not differ statistically from the 18-60 group. The vaccine showed excellent safety profile. Most adverse events, 94 percent, were mild and included flu-like syndromes, injection site reactions, headache and asthenia. No serious adverse events associated with the vaccination is confirmed by independent data monitoring committee. No strong allergies, no anaphylactic shock. The unique substance of the Sputnik V and method of using it has a patent protection in Russia, obtained by Gamma-Layer National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Vaccine timeline June, 2020 Gamma-Layer launches clinical trials of their vaccine, initially called Gamcovid-VAC. August 11th President Vladimir V Putin announced that a Russian health care regulator had approved the vaccine, renamed Sputnik V, before phase 3 trials had even begun. Vaccine experts decry the move as risky. August 20th Russia walks back its earlier announcement, saying the vaccine approval was a conditional registration certificate that depends on positive results from phase 3 trials. September 4th Gamma-Layer researchers published the results of their phase 1.5 trial. In a small study, they found that Sputnik V yielded antibodies to the coronavirus and mild side effects. September 7th a phase 3 trial begins in Russia. October 17th a phase 2 thirds trial launches in India. November 11th the Russian Direct Investment Fund announces the first preliminary evidence from their phase 3 trial, indicating that the vaccine is effective. Based on 20 cases of COVID-19 among the trial participants, Russian scientists estimate that the vaccine has 92 percent efficacy. November the Russian government begins offering Sputnik V within Russia in a mass vaccination campaign, but worry that the vaccine was rushed to approval leads to widespread hesitancy in the country. December the phase 3 trial reaches its final total of 78 cases. The efficacy rate was effectively unchanged, at 91.4 percent. Out of the 78 cases of COVID-19 in the trial, 20 were severe, and all 20 were in volunteers who received the placebo. In addition, the researchers announced that they found no serious side effects from the vaccine. December 11th the drug maker AstraZeneca, which is developing an adenovirus-based vaccine in partnership with the University of Oxford. Joins forces with Gammaeia to see if combining their vaccine with Sputnik V would increase the efficacy of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. December 24th the associated press reports that trial volunteers who suspect they received the placebo are dropping out to receive the vaccine now that it's widely available. The researchers running the trial reduce its planned size from 40,000 to 31,000 participants, causing experts to worry that it will not have enough statistical power to reach strong conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. December 22nd Belarus becomes the first country outside of Russia to register Sputnik V. December 23rd Argentina authorizes the vaccine for emergency use. December 24th AstraZeneca registers a phase one trial for a combination of the Sputnik V and Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines. To end the acute phase of this pandemic, and to control the virus in the longer term, the world needs multiple safe and effective vaccines which can be deployed in a range of populations and countries. This race to COVID-19 vaccine is in full swing. Please watch my videos on other COVID-19 vaccines manufacturers. Please, like, share and subscribe to my channels for more videos on coronavirus.

Coronavirus vaccine race: A matter of political prestige | COVID-19 Special,DW News,2020-11-11,Ves00Enj-fM,"The race for a coronavirus vaccine is not just a matter of saving lives. It's also a matter of saving face for some world leaders. As news broke this week that two vaccines have reached 90 percent efficacy, the incentive to speed up trials is growing. Russia and China are already rolling out their vaccines to the public before final testing. Is that safe? What efficacy rate is high enough? What level of side effects is acceptable? And how can users trust the vaccine they're given? In a world brimming with disinformation, separating fact from fiction is challenging. It's becoming like a bidding war. First, the German US duo BioNTech and Pfizer announcing its success of 90 percent. Then Moscow chimed in, reporting the same figure for its first candidate. That was Monday. Then the interim trial results on Wednesday showing Russia's sputnik vaccine is actually 92 percent effective at protecting people from COVID. It's raising eyebrows among skeptics. But it's also raising hopes that we'll have a vaccine by the end of the year and the more vaccines are better. President Vladimir Putin says Russia is registering its third vaccine against the coronavirus and insists all of them are effective. The scientific community doesn't agree and believes it's starting mass inoculations is risky. The cameras are waiting. They've been promised a celebrity who's ready to be filmed being given the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V. Enter blogger and bodybuilder Alexander Spak. The eccentric social media star takes one last selfie before he's injected with a dose of the still-owned proven vaccine. No one had to talk me into doing it. It's always good to be the first at something. I always had a negative view of vaccinations, but this is different. The doctors will keep an eye on Alexander for the next six months to observe the effects of Sputnik V. The Russian blogger is enthusiastic to be part of the program. Unlike so many other people, he just wants life to get back to how it was. Normally, I travel a lot. I want to work normally to move around normally. I don't like the masks. Now I can get all the medical treatments and be one of the first to be really free. I'm going to be free if I can understand the rest. Batting off international criticism, Russia rushed forward in the global race for a coronavirus vaccine. Back in August, Sputnik V became the world's first registered vaccine. But critically, that was before the results of the all-important phase three trials were published. President Vladimir Putin is eager to be the man who presents the world with an effective vaccine. That would come with guaranteed prestige and, of course, profit. In mid-October, he made another announcement. The Novice-Siberisk-Veix vector center has registered a second Russian coronavirus vaccine, Epi-Vak-Corona. Without doubt, it's an important success that you, dear friends, have achieved. Meanwhile, Alexander Spak waits to hear whether Sputnik V has provided and without antibodies are not. When final testing is over, when or how does production go ahead? Well, the production has already started. Most companies have produced components of the vaccine already. At least one company has also reported that they have at least one bet ready for delivery. And with the components, the other companies will be able to have finished product soon, as soon as they have an approval. Well, ready for delivery. So, hopes are high, but of course, we have to see the final tests. A top army general behind the U.S. vaccine initiative anticipates the first Americans could also start receiving COVID-19 vaccines next month. What do you think about that? Well, the one company that was the first to report positive efficacy results, they said that they now have to wait for summer days to complete the collection of safety data. They need safety data from at least two months after the last shot from all the participants, when they can hand them in the application is complete, then the FDA and the U.S. and the EMA in Europe can start evaluating the vaccine and when they have a positive opinion about it, and when there is an approval, they can start. So, yes, there is a chance to have a approval in December. We rather more would expect it in early January. And as far as production goes, how sufficient would you say the global production capacity actually is? Well, some months ago there has been an estimate that there is a global production capacity of something between two and four billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines that could be produced. That's quite a lot, but obviously we need even more. So, companies have started to find more contract manufacturers that produce components for them, and they have also find other companies where they can license the vaccine too, so that they can produce it as well, EG in Australia, or in South Africa, in Japan, and so on. So, most likely, during 2021, the capacity will even increase. What about the infrastructure? Some of these vaccines have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures. Well, some vaccines indeed need minus 70 degrees Celsius, but fortunately, some others that are also very far in their development, they only need an refrigerator. So, we hope to hear of positive efficacy data in the next weeks, and then this could make the situation a bit easier for those who have to organize all the delivery things. And the WHO has organized the COVAX facility, as they call it, that's the kind of an organization that buys from companies, and then distributes the doses they buy between various countries that I have signed in, and they make sure that a large share goes to middle and lower and middle income countries. So, you don't think those developing countries will be left at the back of the queue? At the moment, it seems that the industrialized nations will most likely be quicker with having enough for their population, but on the other hand, we also have mechanisms that make sure that the low and middle income countries will get their share at an increasing share, as for example, companies in India have licenses to mass produce, vaccine, and they have huge capacities when they can deliver, and they've announced that they will deliver in particular to lower and middle income countries, then they will also have the vaccine they need. And could you give us an idea of how much the vaccine is actually going to cost? Well, some companies have mentioned prices. Some have already stated that they will have differential prices, so a higher price industrialized countries and a lower price in lower and middle income countries. For Germany, it appears that the vaccination will be cheaper than the ordinary influenza vaccination that people have every year, so the prices are really oriented at the lower end, and some companies have stated that they will orient their prices at cost really, at their own manufacturing cost. Well, impressive stuff. Well, Phomke, thank you very much for joining us today from the VFA. Time to ask Derek what he thinks about the latest developments. As always, our science correspondent is standing by to field your questions on the coronavirus. Here in South Africa, some of us who had COVID-19 have experienced memory loss. Is there any research on that? Cognitive dysfunction is one of the symptoms on the long list of those associated with COVID-19 that I think a lot of people really worry about. In some patients, infection with the virus can have effects on cognition as well as on the sensory systems that are tied to it, such as the sense of smell. Some experience delirium or say they still feel a general sense of confusion or find it difficult to focus, even long after other people who caught the disease might have recovered from it. The range of symptoms even has a name. People are calling it a COVID brain fog, and memory loss is being regularly reported by people who experience it. A major recent study from the UK that looked at the coronavirus and cognition, including some aspects of short-term memory, it was pretty disquieting, though it's one that I hasten to add has not yet been through peer review. The scientists behind it compared the results of over 80,000 British participants in a nationwide intelligence test, and they correlated that with data on their COVID-19 status, so whether they'd been infected and if so, how severe it was. The researchers found among COVID-19 patients significant cognitive deficits, including even months later, especially among those who were hospitalized, but even among those who had milder cases. The hope, however, is still that those deficits won't prove lasting."
Vaccinations between health and geo-politics | COVID-19 Special,DW News,2021-02-10,JV9lZjyn_to,"A single shot vaccine and enough for the world would put an end to this pandemic, but that's not the reality. Most require two jabs, some have to be stored in a deep freeze and many still await approval. Plus not all of them are as effective. China is supplying developing countries with vaccines that don't work as well, and the global rollout of COVID shots is slow. Less than 2 percent of the world population has received just one dose of a vaccine so far. Serbia is showing the way in Europe. The Prime Minister was the first European leader to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Her internal affairs minister got the Russian jab and the health minister posed for one of China's shots. The message, vaccination shouldn't be about geopolitics. It's about our health. But it's not always that simple. Even during the pandemic, customers still come in for their coffee. Boyan Georgeovich has run this cafe in Belgrade for three years. A topic often discussed by patrons is which vaccine is the best. US company Pfizer and Russia have so far only delivered a few thousand doses. China has already sent a million. Would I choose to get the Chinese vaccine? Chinese people have been getting it. They wouldn't be harming their own people. Maybe I'll take Pfizer's vaccine. They are an economically strong company. It's a bit of a dilemma for me. Serbia's government has promised to buy various vaccines from providers all over the world. It's then up to citizens to decide which one they want to get. I'll get the Chinese or Russian vaccine, not the Pfizer one. If I had to choose, I'd take the Russian one. The Russian one. I like Russia. I have Russian friends. I trust them. Who to trust? There's a lack of detailed information about the various vaccines. That's why many Serbian doctors are hesitant with their advice. I get at least ten calls a day. People asking whether they should get vaccinated. And if so, using which vaccine? We only have information on the Pfizer vaccine. I just don't know enough about the other ones. No one seems sure, but plenty of people are driven by their fear of getting sick. Older citizens can receive the vaccine at a total of 200 special sites, like at this exhibition center in Belgrade. Serbia purchased 8 million vaccines from Western suppliers, from Russia and China, but only China can deliver millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines in a short period of time. So China's reputation on the Balkan is on the rise. In the meantime, Boyan Georgeovich has made his decision. Many of my customers who come here know more than I do about vaccines. So now I have decided to get the Chinese one. Like many Serbians, they take the pragmatic view that the best vaccine is the most available one. And here, China seems to have won the race. Well, I thought it was a race against the coronavirus. Isn't that what we should be focusing on? Oh, Dragon, Yankevich, WHO's technical officer for the vaccine preventable diseases and immunization program in Europe. Why aren't we the world winning this race? Thank you for having me and thank you for this question. We do believe that we are winning the race. You have the vaccine invented in the period of the last 12 years, sorry, 12 months, that never happened before. So generally last year there was a genotype of COVID-19, SARS-Soviet was available to the scientific community. And in November, December, we did have the first vaccine appearing on the market. There is still war going on, that's true. And there are battles that we won, but there are still many more to go, because as you know, the virus circulating still is pandemic all around the world. And there are many cases and many people to be immunized. Well, we've managed to achieve the unachievable according to so many people. But the simple things, like the lack of information on the various vaccines in many countries, why can't we solve that sort of thing? It's a additional challenge, it's a new product, it's a scientific information. First, there's a new product, it's always hard to have complete information, what, then, how, and what can be related to. And on the other side, it's a technical scientific information, which is not easily transformed in the language, it's acceptable to everybody and is easy to follow. So it's one of the additional requirements that we have in this situation, to make better acceptance in public, all those new products, and to have people motivated to get immunized. Udragan, isn't that something the world health organization should be doing and is responsible for? And it's true, it's indeed the fact that we are doing. On the base of the scientific approach, there is a procedure for a quick approval of any kind of medicament, new vaccines included. In the emergency setting, WHO is using our mechanism to collect as many as possible technical information and get preliminary approval. Emergency use, a listing of that product to be delivered all around the world to fight with the epidemic. In the case that it's not that the final activity is continuous activity, meaning that that product must to be continuously monitored and controlled for the quality, for safety and efficacy. And that's how we are ensuring that all the countries and population is receiving the high quality product. It's relevant for the global level because not all the countries have capacity by their own national authorities to approve and test the products. And it's also kind of the mechanism that we already have in place through the UNICEF supply and with the COVAX that every single country can rely on these results and have the technical information. And in regards, giving the proper information we are trying to follow up all this technical information with additional questions and answers and communication tools for the population, but also for healthcare workers, how they can communicate the quality and benefits of the vaccine to the population. Well, being at the WHO, are specific vaccines most suitable for specific regions then? No, then all the vaccines which are approved are equally useful in any part of the world. In this moment there is only one vaccine which received emergency use listing, but we hope till the mid of February this year to help three or four more, one of them is Moderna, the other is AstraZeneca, there is procedure initiated for the vaccines produced in China and in Russia. So we hope to have more available tools to fight with this pandemic very soon. And again, with the existing knowledge for the clinical studies and preliminary use in some of the countries in the different parts of the world, all vaccines are showing sufficient efficacy in preventing a hard manifestation of the cellar cases of disease. That's in preventing the burden or the burnout of the health system, which is what are priority in this moment of the pandemic. Tell me what do you recommend for a faster global rollout of these COVID vaccines? Well, we have many vaccines which are still in procedure of approval, so we are inviting manufacturers to continue with the procedures to apply and get permission for use of the vaccine. There is a critical need to increase capacities to produce physically more doses of vaccine because we need them again as soon as possible, sooner is better. And it's also the issue that it should be equally distributed on the global level, meaning that through the COAC system that we are participating, we would like to see that all people of the first level of the face and all people belonging to the first three groups, meeting elderly people and people with a background health conditions receive vaccine as soon as possible. We are not as mentioned safe globally until every one of us is safe and preventing of the cases is also preventing of the further mutation of the virus, which is normal for the virus. So wherever whoever is getting demonized and as many of us get immune, it's better for all of us. Dr. Nyanka Vitch from the WHO Europe, thank you very much. Thank you. It's that part of the show when Derek Williams takes the floor to answer your questions on the coronavirus. If you test positive, can you be vaccinated anyway, or should you first recover, then get the vaccination? This is the biggest vaccine campaign in history, and just a little over two months, about 140 million doses of vaccine have been injected worldwide, and around five million more are now going into arms every single day. So it's no wonder that questions like these are common. The answer to whether you should be vaccinated anyway, if you test positive for the disease is actually simple, but the explanation is slightly complicated. The first thing to understand is that if you already have COVID-19, then it's too late for a vaccine to fix things. It takes at least 10 days after a first dose for your body to start ramping up an effective immune response to SARS-CoV-2. So getting a vaccine right after testing positive for the disease won't help you. The general recommendation is that you should wait to recover before even thinking about vaccination since aside from the dangers that getting vaccinated while you're still sick might pose to your own health, it could also expose others. Everything I've read indicates that if you've completed the recommended isolation period and are symptom-free, then it's okay to go ahead with vaccination. Although the CDC also recommends that patients who are treated with monoclonal antibodies or with convalescent plasma, that they should wait at least 90 days before getting a shot. In general, the experts say the chances that you'll contract COVID-19 again within that period are very slim anyway. As naturally acquired immunity caused by the infection seems to remain strong in practically everyone for at least that long. Derek Williams, there and keep setting in your questions to our YouTube channel. I'm Ben Fizzoulin, thanks for watching, stay safe, and I'll see you again very soon here on DW. Bye-bye."
COVID-19: Chinese vaccine maker Sinopharm says it can churn out over one billion doses in 2021,CNA,2020-10-20,bC4NMSadFdk,"Sinopharm, one of several Chinese firms, holding a late-stage trials of a coronavirus of vaccine, says it may have capacity to produce more than one billion doses next year. Lina Lin reports. In a briefing on Tuesday, government officials said that China's use of experimental vaccines was backed by the World Health Organization and also went through layers of domestic regulatory approval. Since the launch of an emergency inoculation program in July, hundreds of thousands of people in China have been given experimental trial-stage vaccines. An official say that people who have received the vaccines include frontline workers in healthcare and logistics, as well as people who urgently needed to leave China for work overseas. In addition, officials say about 60,000 people have received the vaccines in phase three clinical trials, with no serious site effects reported so far. China currently has four vaccine candidates in phase three trials. And as the spread of the coronavirus is under control within China, current trials are being conducted in 10 areas, including the United Arab Emirates, Paris, Peru, Argentina, and Egypt. And Sinopharm, a state-owned pharmaceutical firm, says it may have the capacity to produce more than one billion doses next year. Officials convened the briefing on Tuesday to provide more information on vaccine development just days after Sinopharm launched an online reservation for people seeking COVID-19 vaccines in Beijing and Wuhan. State media Global Times reported that more than 150,000 people have made reservations for the experimental vaccine and that students who will travel abroad among the priority groups being offered the vaccine shot for free. Meanwhile, the BBC recently reported that hundreds of people have been seen queuing up outside the hospital in the EU in eastern China for experimental vaccines costing around $60 USD a shot.

11 Singapore private healthcare providers allowed to bring in Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine,CNA,2021-07-30,zwbk0NS8iUY,"11 private hospitals and clinics have been given the go-ahead to bring in Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines. Now they will arrive under the Health Sciences Authorities Special Access Root. Another Chinese-made vaccine, Sinovag, was approved under the same root last month. The Sinopharm vaccine is close to 80 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 infection. HSA stresses that the risks of using vaccines approved under the scheme are fully borne by the doctor and the person getting the jab. Medical groups say they are still working out the details such as the quantity to bring in when they will arrive and the cost. The ultimate aim is to vaccinate as many people as possible. Both Sinopharm and Sinovag is of the same technology. So I mean, it provides options for our community. So that small group of people that may want to be vaccinated but but rather to have their choice, you know, or medical reason for that. I mean, it's always best to help them to facilitate this to happen."
China Approves Sinopharm's Covid Vaccine for General Use,Bloomberg Television,2020-12-30,yL4SDHEqGYE,"Tom, what do we know? Yeah, Rich. So this is a vaccines produced by a unit of Sinopharm, as you say, the shares are rallying today on the back of this approval. The unit is called the China National Biotech Group, or CNBG. Now, they would give an emergency use approval back in July. They've now today been given official use to roll this out for the general public. And we heard from Chinese officials saying, for example, that since December the 15th, they've vaccinated three million people here in China already. They said that the new variant, the new mutant variant of the virus, that that doesn't seem to affect the vaccine according to evidence that they've seen. They also said that they have the output to meet the demand to inoculate the general public. They've said previously, Chinese officials that they do want to create herd immunity here. And again, it's a reminder, Sinopharm is the state-backed drug maker here. It's a big beast in terms of the push to develop vaccines. And it's a reminder of just how determined China is to be a leader in terms of the production and supply of vaccines to tackle COVID-19, not just for its domestic population, but internationally as well. All right, Tom. We were speaking earlier to Paul Tumbaya from the NUS Yonglu Lin School here in Singapore. And speaking to him as well about the vaccine that China has approved, let's just take a listen to what he said. A big concern is that China only has a very limited number of pre-qualified vaccines which go through the manufacturing process and the rigorous WHO scrutiny. So they have, I think, a six or seven vaccines which are WHO pre-qualified in comparison with other countries, for example, India, Indonesia and Korea, which have close to a dozen each. So the key question has got to be the scrutiny of the vaccine. And Tom, so I guess the challenge as well as convincing people to take the vaccine and the affordability front? Absolutely. So on the first question, the convincing of the population domestically, that will be a challenge, as we say, officials have already said they've already inoculated 3 million people here. So they're making some progress, but the reason it'll be a challenge is because historically, there have been scandals around pharmaceutical companies in China. And so when you speak to people here, there is a deep-seated concern still about just the safety levels of some of these vaccines. So China will have to push through that. There's a question as well around how transparent they've been and certainly compared to the likes of their Western peers Pfizer and Moderna, for example, AstraZeneca as well. China has not been as transparent about its trial data. And of course, that does raise questions then for some about the efficacy and about the safety. Now, they've said that they will publish that data at a later point, but there will be, you would have thought, particularly from those international countries, the other countries that are buying up this vaccine, that demand to see that data pretty quickly. In terms of the cost factor, yes, look, this is going to be a vaccine that will be easier to get out in terms of supply chains because it doesn't have to be kept at these very, very low temperatures. It's not part of this mRNA technology that Moderna and Pfizer have used. So in that respect, it's a benefit. And that is why you've seen a lot of emerging markets, countries in Latin America, for example, but also in Asia signing up to get access to this vaccine. Just recently, in terms of the data, you just had a red flag. You had the likes of the UAE saying that, look, this CNBG vaccine is effective in 86 percent of those who were vaccinated and then China came out and said, actually, it's 79.3 percent. So it's those kind of discrepancies that cause concern. Tom, also, I think they have an ambitious effort in Beijing to inoculate 50 million people ahead of the lunar new year. Now, that's quite a challenge, but one would assume that it's actually quite achievable given how quickly and how many people they were able to test in a very short period of time. That's right. So they may use the testing infrastructure that, again, as you point to has been put to use with quite significant efficacy in the last few months to clamp down on some clusters that we've seen in the west of the country, the northeast of the country. They've really leveraged that system of testing, mass testing in a very short amount of time. They can use that infrastructure potentially to help roll out these vaccines. Of course, the population here is huge, 1.3, 1.4 billion people. They have said that, as you point to in terms of leading up to the lunar new year holidays, they do want to get as many people vaccinated as possible, specifically front line workers and those state owned companies have already been vaccinated and none of them, but also front line workers, those working in logistics as well as healthcare, of course. So there is that push and they will be hoping that they can leverage that infrastructure that they already have in place around testing for the vaccine itself."
Inside the Lab That Invented the COVID-19 Vaccine,Be Smart,2020-12-08,-92HQA0GcI8,"This is how coronavirus invades your body animated sinking its crown-like spikes into your cells using molecular deception to pick their locks and hijacking your body But there is one way to prevent this by using one of the virus's weapons on itself Hey smart people Joe here right now There's about seven billion people all waiting for the same thing a vaccine that will protect us from the virus causing COVID-19 And if you're like me, you want to know what's in it? What makes it work? Making a vaccine and getting it out to the public is a long process with a lot of steps So we can make sure the vaccine is safe and effective And it's pretty typical for that to take 10 years or more in an emergency like this pandemic Well, we can't skip any of those steps But we can speed this up by doing some of them at the same time But none of that can happen until you figure out the first step research What do you put in your vaccine that will make it protect people and that's what we're going to talk about today We're going to visit a lab and meet some scientists who study the coronavirus We're also going to meet a really big awesome science machine and learn how they used it to design this as a model The key ingredient inside the very first COVID-19 vaccines Now here's my goal with this video to show you what exactly is in the new COVID vaccines that Makes them work and how they got made faster than any vaccine in history My hope is that you'll be better informed when you get your shot and you'll have a new appreciation for why science like this is so important This is how to make a COVID-19 vaccine Title it's okay to be smart It turns out that some of the most important research for making the COVID-19 vaccine is happening right down the road for me At the University of Texas at Austin is pretty cool because I did my PhD right here and in here is the lab of Dr. Jason McLellan he studies how pathogens like coronavirus caused disease There are four human coronaviruses that occur seasonally and generally cause the common cold He wears a mask and there have been three coronaviruses that have caused pandemics And that's the first SARS coronavirus back in 2002 the merged coronavirus in 2012 and now SARS-CoV-2 which emerged earlier this year At the end of December 2019 it was on the news that there is these pneumonia clusters in China in the scientific community We thought maybe a new flu virus or possibly a coronavirus. I was actually snowboarding with my family and My collaborator Barney Graham at the vaccine research center at the NIH called and he said he's been in contact with USC DC Chinese CDC It looks like it's a beta coronavirus similar to to SARS and they wanted to move rapidly trying to make a vaccine And I said we're definitely in so you're just like scrolling through your phone in the ski lodge Yeah, we're like we gotta get to work So all the rest of us were focused on royal family drama and just hearing the first mentions of coronavirus for the very first time Scientists like Jason knew this was serious and they were already getting to work as soon as researchers in China decoded the virus Genome and published it online Jason's lab could start designing a vaccine. I texted Daniel rap my graduate student and let them know beyond high alert Because as soon as we get the sequence we're gonna move as quickly as we can rap Jason was on that winter vacation And texted me that it was a coronavirus and eventually in early January the sequence was released online publicly And then things started moving pretty quickly Let's step back for a minute. What does a vaccine do? Well, it trains your immune system to know what a germ like a virus looks like so they can recognize the germ Fight it off and keep you safe without you getting sick This is the virus that causes COVID-19 the outer shell is made of a few different kinds of proteins But these proteins sticking off the side are the most important part the spike in animation These spikes are what give this family of viruses their name the corona viruses Because they look kind of like a crown the corona virus uses that spike to sneak into our cells The three-dimensional shape of that spike is super important because that exact shape is what lets the virus latch on to receptors On the outside of our cells almost like picking a lock and then it sneaks inside Those shapes sticking out on the outside of a virus are also what your immune system is feeling for To figure out if this is a foreign invader if it should attack or not The problem is the first time your body sees a virus your immune system responds so slowly that the virus has time to make gazillions of copies of itself And you can still get very very sick That's what's great about a vaccine it trains your immune system what to look for so when the real virus shows up Your body can respond super fast and destroy the virus before it has a chance to hijack your cells So what's actually in a vaccine? Well, sometimes a vaccine has a weakened or dead virus That's how polio and measles and mumps and some other vaccines work But these days a vaccine usually just contains a little piece of the virus the newest COVID-19 vaccines They're just the spike But for that spike to work as a vaccine to train your immune system to recognize the actual virus It has to have the same three-dimensional shape as the spike on the whole complete virus But making a spike all by itself not attached to the rest of the virus It turns out to be really hard because the spike is actually pretty floppy just floating around on its own It doesn't look much like the spike on the actual virus And this is the key thing Jason's lab figured out how to make for years They'd studied SARS and MERS viruses which are really closely related to the virus that causes COVID So they already knew what tiny tweaks to make to freeze the coronavirus spikes into the perfect shape So we got to work designing our stabilizing mutations into the new spike sequence There is just two amino acids that we knew would if we mutated them it would stabilize the spike protein Make it a lot easier to work with in the laboratory A protein like the coronavirus spike is a long-folded string of individual units called amino acids And these strings of amino acids are built using code written in RNA and stored in DNA By changing or mutating the letters of DNA code we can change the amino acids in our protein string with wrap It's cool. You're like building scaffolding into the protein to be like freeze in this in this shape Yeah, that's a good way to put it. How do you from there to making the actual spike protein? I can show you okay scientists are able to grow special immortal human cells outside the body Which they use as factories? They put a modified gene for something like their spike protein into those cells And then they'll start spitting out this protein. So they're just pumping it out into the liquider. Yeah, that's right They take that liquid run it through special purification machines and are able to isolate a pure sample of their spike protein But how do they know for sure that this special spike protein looks like the real thing 3D shape and all Well, they take pictures of it using a big awesome science machine This is a cryo electron microscope This machine took a 3D picture of the coronavirus spike and helped design the very first COVID-19 vaccine I got the big science machine Looks like a giant microwave I mean the room is like a million dollars and then the microscope's another million So you're saying don't touch me against green right so you can see like the floor is separate from the instrument So it's on its own vibrations are bad The climbers these are wall panels that contain water running behind them to keep the temperature constant in the room And then it also has to be a electromegnetically shielded to that is nuts Buffy cable over here. So that's the 200,000 volts coming from that. Okay. Yeah, so don't like that one Yeah, he opens it. Oh, this is Science-y look at all that science happening in there Kind of a marvel of physics and engineering subtitles. Can you play doom on this thing? Some of our computers you'd be able to play at max settings So maybe this sounds like a super stupid question But why can't you just use a regular light microscope to take a picture of a protein? Well the wavelength of visible light is on the order of hundreds of nanometers And that means the smallest things you can see with visible light are also on the scale hundreds of nanometers But what we want to see the atoms in a protein molecule They're angstroms apart tenths of a nanometer So we can't use visible light We have to use a special electron microscope So super-hinergy electrons make very tiny wavelengths Which lets you see very very small resolution things. That's right. Okay. I want a camera like that. That's better than 4k We can go angstrom k So to take a 3d picture of a protein with a cryo electron microscope First you put a drop of protein onto a special metal grid Then you freeze it in place with liquid ethane when we shoot a beam of electrons added These proteins will be in all kinds of random orientations each orientation leaves a particular shadow Powerful computers look at all of those 2d images and then combine them into a final 3d shape It's kind of like using a bunch of 2d photos to make a 3d model And when Jason and Daniel and their team looked at the spike that they made with their tiny little tweaks and mutations Their spike has the same 3d shape as the spike on the whole virus pretty cool Now we can put that spike into people and see if it trains their immune system and protects them from their real virus and It works This protects people from COVID-19 the research you just saw from those scientists is literally what's being used in the very first COVID-19 vaccines and some of those vaccines work in a really cool way Instead of having to make the actual spike protein in these big factories with huge tanks of cells like the ones that we saw Some of these new vaccines the genetic instructions for making the spike is all that's in the shot On a molecule called MRNA your body uses those instructions to make the spike You are the factory That's awesome. This is a really incredible piece of science A year ago no one had ever seen this virus before and thanks to these scientists and thousands of others around the world Now we have vaccines that work. I mean it's gonna take months maybe years to get these vaccines and the dozens of others still being worked on To the billions of people that need them and that's a huge challenge on its own But this isn't really hopeful story No vaccine in history has ever been invented this fast and we were able to do it safely We were able to do this so quickly because scientists like Jason and his lab and others They were ready because they were studying basic scientific questions about other coronaviruses SARS and MRS They've spent years trying to figure out their secrets so that when this one showed up They were already 10 steps ahead And to me that's why work like this supporting basic research is so important and why we need it Stay curious and And get your vaccine as soon as you can. I'm really ready for this to be over As always a very special thank you to everyone who supports the show on patreon If you'd like to learn more about our community There's a link down in the description where you can learn more We really appreciate your support and if you don't want to support us that way We're just glad you're here learning what this this week and I'll see you in the next video Who's there Vaccinate who That was pretty good I'll keep you Title PBS"
UAE is first government to officially approve Chinese coronavirus vaccine developed by Sinopharm,South China Morning Post,2020-12-09,M3xdbadNiyo,-...
China's Sinopharm says vaccine 79% effective vs coronavirus,Rappler,2020-12-30,14WnBSsRBVY,"Chinese pharmaceuticals' sign-of-arm announces Wednesday, December 30, its coronavirus vaccine is 79 percent effective in its phase 3 trials. This is lower than rival vaccines developed by Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna, but a potential breakthrough in the battle to stem the pandemic in Asia. Beijing Institute of Biological Products says the protective effect of sign-of-arm vaccine against COVID-19 is 79.34 percent. China is struggling to gain international trust for its vaccine candidates, hindered by a lack of transparency on test results. It has also been slow to complete phase 3 trials, which had to be conducted abroad due to China's success at curbing the spread of COVID-19 within its own borders. Chinese officials have repeatedly assured the public of the vaccine's safety, claiming that there have been no serious adverse reactions."
Study: Sinopharm COVID-19 Vaccine Effective Against Some Variants,TTT Live Online,2021-07-24,XMyTKr2xoS4,"Researchers in Sri Lanka found that China's Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine is highly efficient against the Delta variant which has become the dominant variant across the world. According to the study, 95 percent of individuals who received two doses of the Sinopharm vaccine have developed antibodies similar to a naturally infected COVID-19 person. Professor of Molecular Genetics and Virology at the University of the West Indies Professor Christine Carrington made reference to the study in her presentation. The study, which at this stage has not yet been peer reviewed, it investigated how the immune response induced by the Sinopharm vaccine performed in general and against three variants of the virus. They looked at the alpha variant, that was the one first identified in the UK, the beta variant in South Africa and the Delta variant. She said not all COVID-positive samples are tested for variants. Obviously, we're screening samples looking for the Delta variant. First of all, not every single infected person in front of dad gives a sample to be screened and a lot of people who are asymptomatic and don't even know that they're sick. So we don't get every single case of COVID-19 coming to us to be screened for the Delta variant. Also, not all samples are suitable for sequencing. And though the variant hasn't been detected in Trinidad and Tobago, Professor Carrington said it doesn't mean that it isn't here. She also responded to those questioning the concept of herd immunity. Being infected is not the same as being sick. You can get infected and not get sick. And that is the aim of the vaccine. So the vaccines want to keep you as healthy as possible. They give you the best chance against the virus. Should you be infected? So that's one reason to get vaccinated. Professor Carrington also shared the same sentiments as Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ruchan Parasram. She said it's just a matter of time before the Delta variant arrives in this country."
Chinese vaccine comparisons,Dr. John Campbell,2022-12-11,MN315cA3Aaw,"It's Sunday, the 11th of December. We’re going to be looking at what’s going on in China and thinking a little bit about the SinoPharm vaccine. We might compare that a bit with the mRNA vaccines we have in the West, vaccines that work in a completely different way, with completely different approaches to vaccination. Now, the SinoPharm efficacy, according to the World Health Organization, is a 79% relative risk reduction in preventing infection and hospitalization. Why? Because the original paper claimed a 95% relative risk reduction, but later analysis showed that this gives an absolute risk reduction of 0.84% protection against infection during the period of the trial. Although, to be fair, this did soar to a 3.7% protection in the five to six months after the trial, and we’ll look at that in more detail. Interestingly, this pandemic began with China, and now China is the last place where the pandemic is going to become endemic as we live with the virus. So there are lots of interesting details in this, and just before we go on, we will look at the way that the Chinese administer the vaccines. Another reason I’m not too concerned about the vaccination program in China is that it’s actually quite robust. Here’s a comparison: In the West, the vaccine is administered with the needle straight in and aspirated to make sure it’s not in a blood vessel. In China, the nurse pops the needle in, does a slow aspiration to make sure she’s not in a vessel, and only then does she inject it. So there are two different vaccines with two different approaches to vaccination. Let’s get straight on to the detail now. So China is making big changes. All of a sudden, they’re shifting to a strategy to live with the virus. This is the new premiere policy. China is entering a new situation. The virus’s ability to cause disease is weakened. My understanding is that Omicron is less pathogenic, of course, than the previous variants, such as Alpha and Delta. I don’t know that it’s weakened over the past few weeks, so I don’t think that’s particularly true, but I’m just quoting what has been said. They’re lifting most of the severe COVID policies, ending quarantine camps, allowing people to isolate at home, and ending family separations in quarantine camps. I mean, just think of the oppression the Chinese people have been under for these three years; it really is quite incredible. In areas where they’ve been trying to control the virus, close contacts are no longer taken to quarantine camps. A strict ban on blocking fire exits and fire doors has now come into force—though it’s a bit late for some people. The requirement to show tests for venues is now negated for most venues, and there are fewer rules on internal travel. Chinese New Year is coming up on the 21st of January, which means there will be huge internal travel, and the virus will spread all over the country, if not before. Lateral flow tests are now largely replacing PCR tests, and there will be continued fig leaf lockdowns in some areas. Foreign travel next year will see cases at 30,000 a day at the moment, so this is going to grow exponentially in China; there’s no real question about that. So, the Chinese are trying to present this as a gradual lifting of restrictions, but the virus doesn’t work that way. You either have exponential spread or you don’t, so it’s a bit of a fig leaf to cover the change in policy in China, but I’m certainly delighted that it has changed. It was absurd for a long time, so now everyone will be exposed. I want to say that everyone in the country will be exposed—there might be a few of the 1.4 billion people who aren’t, but basically everyone will be exposed. Will the medical system be overwhelmed? I think probably not. The medical system in China is quite variable, from excellent to poor, but they have a tremendous ability to scale up rapidly if they need to. Also, the vaccination program in China will offer some protection. Don’t jump down my throat yet; I’m going to explain that. The National Health Commission has said that all localities are focusing on improving the vaccination rate of people aged 60 to 79, so they’re working on this now. The Chinese vaccine, the SinoPharm vaccine, is not an mRNA vaccine. It does not get into cells and stimulate the cell’s own genetic material to stimulate the antigen or the immune responses. It does not use an adenovirus vector to enter cells and stimulate the cell’s own genetic material to make the antigen. It’s just a plain, old-fashioned dead virus—basically, dead viral material. It works in a completely different way, so it probably has a completely different safety profile as well. Because it works in a completely different way, there’s no systemic absorption of mRNA particles in a lipid envelope that travels around the body, which you get with mRNA vaccines. It’s a completely different approach to vaccination. Anyway, they’re going to encourage lots of people to get this vaccine, which is consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines. They are accelerating the vaccination campaign, aiming to make special arrangements to get vaccines out quickly in China. A professor at Hong Kong University has said that the main way for China to exit COVID with the least damage is through the vaccination of three doses, which does make a lot of sense in the Chinese situation. As we said, it is a completely different approach to vaccination; it’s the tried and tested traditional method that’s been around for over a hundred years. Hopefully, by the start of the Year of the Rabbit on January 22nd, this approach will be fully rolled out. The World Health Organization has guidelines that we follow on this channel, and they say that the vaccine is safe and effective for all individuals aged 18 and over. The SinoPharm vaccine is an inactivated vaccine with an adjuvant that increases the immunogenicity of the virus, and it’s a good idea. I wonder why we didn’t use this approach in the West. What you can do is brew up huge amounts of this virus, culture the cells in large vats, kill the virus, and inject it. It’s a tried and tested process. That’s what the Chinese have done, and I’m curious why we didn’t use this method instead of novel, patentable technologies. The technology used for SinoPharm vaccines is routinely employed in many other vaccines, and the World Health Organization is 100% correct that this technology has a good safety profile, including for pregnant women. I don’t have specialized knowledge about pregnant women in this situation, but there’s no reason to suspect that the safety profile isn’t good. This technology is well-established and known for years, even though it’s not the approach we used in the West. The Chinese approach to vaccination is very clever. With a 79% efficacy in preventing hospitalization and infection, the absolute risk reduction is not given on the WHO website, nor was it on the original Pfizer paper. They must have forgotten to include it. However, I expect the absolute risk reduction for the Chinese vaccine to be relatively high over the next six months due to the widespread presence of the virus in China. I would certainly expect it to be higher than 3.7%. Currently, we don’t have the data for the Chinese vaccine’s absolute risk reduction, but given the imminent widespread virus transmission, it might be as high as 50% or more. As the virus spreads, we will see if the absolute risk reduction is indeed high. Meanwhile, I believe some people are very keen to sell mRNA vaccines to the Chinese, perhaps to make money, but the Chinese have resisted this. I disagree with the Chinese on some policies and agree with them on others. According to patient information, absolute risk reduction refers to your risk of developing the disease over a period of time. To be fair to the mRNA vaccines, during the five to six months, the absolute risk reduction for the Pfizer vaccine did increase to 3.7%, up from 0.84%. For Moderna, it increased from 1.24% to 4.9%. So, the Chinese have delayed far too long in my view. The virus will now spread throughout the entire population, and the absolute risk reduction from the vaccine should be pretty high over the next few months if they can roll it out to older and vulnerable people. I’m confident that they will pull out all the stops on this one, which will save a lot of lives in China. As people get exposed and re-exposed to the virus, it will become endemic in China as it has everywhere else in the world."
What are the possible side effects of Sinopharm?,One News PH,2021-01-08,BAyTczFXasc,"Most unsafe in the world. This is how a report from a Taiwanese news website described China sign-of-farm vaccine. This was the brand supposedly administered to the members of the President's Security Group. Siting a vaccine expert, Taiwan News reported that sign-of-farm vaccine has around 73 side-effects, including loss of the shun. Shanghai-based vaccine expert Talina identified other side-effects like high blood pressure, loss of taste, and delayed menstruation. He claims that all 73 side-effects are already listed on the vaccine's manual. Tal posted this claim on his AWAYBO page, but it was immediately taken down by Chinese authorities. Sign-of-farm has been granted conditional approval in China after garnering a 79 percent efficacy rate. Sign-of-farm, along with another Chinese vaccine sign-of-farm, are both expected to apply for emergency use authorization in the Philippines. But speaking on one news agenda, FDA Director Eric Domingo says there has been no communication between them and sign-of-farm. So, so far, I know farm is not a no. We have no indication that they will submit soon. I know that what will submit soon is probably the health department also assures to public that should sign-of-farm apply for EUA in the Philippines, their documents will be thoroughly assessed. As for sign-of-farm, Domingo says it has already inquired about EUA requirements. FDA evaluation and Pfizer is expected next week after the US drug maker applied for EUA in December. The FDA says they are also checking the application of AstraZeneca, which was admitted this week. AstraZeneca's authorization may be released after three weeks of evaluation. Russia's Sputnik, on the other hand, has withdrawn its application to conduct phase three trials here in the Philippines. The OSD Undersecretary to Wena Guevara says the government is currently in talks with 25 bilateral partners for vaccine negotiations. For news 5, Marisol Helili, we are one news."
18_1 Is the Sinopharm BIBP (Covilo) COVID-19 vaccine safe and effective?,COVID-19 Infovaccines,2022-09-28,zNmQMn9NVXE,"Is the CINOS Farm BIBP, Cobiolo, COVID-19 vaccine safe and effective? The COVID-19 BIBP is an aluminium hydroxide adjuvated inactivated whole virus vaccine, which was granted Darycho emergency-juiced in EUL in May 2021. The Darycho-EUL process evaluates the quality of manufacturing along with all available safety and efficacy data. All of the vaccines that have achieved Darycho-EUL can be considered safe and highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19. Since receiving the Darycho-EUL, this vaccine has been administered to millions of people around the world and data from the field have been assessed in WHO updates of its entering guidance published in October 2021 on March 2022. For example, in Hungary, vaccine effectiveness in a large-snext-wide cohort, approximately 900,000 recipients of BIBP COVID-19 vaccine was 69 percent against a SARS-CoV-2 infection and 88 percent against COVID-19-related mortality. Cino-Farm BIBP is intended for persons aged 18 years and older. The recommended primary vaccine series is two doses given intra-missed to the Ltoid Masle. A booster dose is recommended for the highest and high priority use groups, disease, older adults, health workers, persons with comorbidities, administer 4-6 months after completion of the primary series."
Chinese vaccine Sinopharm vaccine for Kids | Covid vaccine for Kids,BiologyExplained,2021-09-24,bS7uYcZDJ8c,"In this video, I am going to talk in details about the safety and efficacy of synopharm vaccine on kids aged between 3 to 17 years. For this study, the kids were divided into three groups. Group 1 had kids aged between 3 to 5, group 2 had kids aged between 6 to 12, and group 3 had kids aged between 13 to 17. They gave three dose regime in each group, 2 microgram, 4 microgram or 8 microgram. In each group, there were three dose. The doses were given on day 0, day 28 and day 56. That is, it is a three dose vaccine trial and three types of doses were given in each group. There was a control group, but the vaccine was not given. It is required to compare the results of the vaccinated and the unvaccinated group. They looked at the different types of side effects that occurred in these three groups. The most common side effect was pain in the injection site. Let's see the data in deep more details. 4 percent of the participants had pain in group 3 to 5, 9.1 percent of the participants had pain in group 6 to 12, and 7.9 percent of the participants had pain in group 17 to 13. It was found that the participants in group 6 to 12 and 17 to 13 years had more pain in the injection site compared to the control group that did not get the vaccine. The other two common side effects were fever and cough, which ranged from mild to moderate in all the three age groups. In age group 3 to 5, 12.7 percent of the participants had fever. In age group 6 to 12, 5.2 percent had fever, and in age group 13 to 17, 10.3 percent had fever. To know in more details about each group, please refer to the article. I will provide the link in the description. The frequency of occurrence of fever was less after the second and the third dose. Next common side effect was cough, and in age group 3 to 5, 8.5 percent in vaccinated group had cough, in 6 to 12, 3.2 percent had cough, and in the age group 13 to 17, 2.4 percent of the participants had cough in the vaccinated group. There was no report of upper respiratory tract infection. The side effects were not significantly different from the control group, which did not get the vaccine. So it seems that the side effects are under control and not anything very severe. However, in the age group 6 to 12, one severe acute allergic reaction was reported on day 4 after the second dose in the 2-microgram group. It was found that the participant had previous history of allergy, and thus was not given the third dose. They also looked at the side effects like headache, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, eczema, etc. I am not going into the exact percentage here. Please refer to the article description in the link. In overall, age group 13 to 17 had more systematic adverse reactions like fever, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, etc. So it seems that the side effects are under control and so the sign of the vaccine seems to be safe for children age 13 to 17. Now we have to understand what percentage of participants produced antibodies, and what percentage produced utilizing antibodies. 28 days after the first dose, in the age group 3 to 5, 75 to 91 percent produced antibodies. In the age group 6 to 12, 95 to 100 percent produced antibodies, and in the age group 13 to 17, 99 to 100 percent produced antibodies. By day 56, 100 percent of the participants produced antibodies. It was seen in the dose group where 4 microgram and 8 microgram of vaccine was given, the amount of antibody was significantly higher compared to the 2-microgram group. And what about the neutralizing antibodies? Remember neutralizing antibodies are specific antibodies that stop the virus from entering our cell, all groups produced detectable amounts of neutralizing antibodies by day 28. By day 56, that takes 28 days after the second dose, all the groups produced neutralizing antibodies to the level found in the adult population. However, in the age group 3 to 5 on 28th day, the total antibody and neutralizing antibody was lower. This kind of lower antibody response might be due to the under trained immune response in the younger generation. So overall, synopharm seems to be safe with controllable side effects and produces good amount of antibody. But what about the efficacy percentage in the kids? In this study, they have not looked at the efficacy percentage. However, in a bridging study in UAE, which included 900 kids aged between 3 to 17 years, it was found that synopharm gave 100 percent protection against severe symptoms and overall protection was found to be 72 percent. So, efficacy seems to be good, it is safe and it produces good amount of antibody. However, apart from antibody, T cell response is also very, very important in case of long-term immunity. However, in this study, they have not looked at the T cell response. Moreover, they did not look at the neutralizing effect of the antibodies on the different variants, which is very, very important to understand how effective it is on the different variants. China and UAE have approved synopharm for kids aged between 3 to 17 years. What about your country? Have they approved any vaccine for the kids? Let me know in the comment the name of the vaccine and the country name where it has been approved. That's it for today, if you like this video, don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe for more updates. Thank you."
What are the side effects of Covid 19 vaccine?,Tiny Medicine,2021-06-14,CXepu7DyXV4,"Today, I'm going to tell you all the known side effects of the coronavirus vaccines. Most of these side effects are common to all major coronavirus vaccines, including Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, and Oxford AstraZeneca. And we can't ignore the blood clotting cases reported with AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines. The Sputnik V vaccine by Russia and the Chinese vaccine CinoFarm will also feature in this video. So if you are looking for an evidence-based, unbiased video about the side effects of the coronavirus vaccine, you are going to enjoy this video. Miner side effects are good signs. Immediate side effects are pain at the sight of the injection, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint aches. I consider them as good signs because they indicate that the vaccine is working and generating an immune response. These symptoms can last up to 48 hours and relieved with simple analgesics. Rarely, mild bruises or hematomas can form under the skin at the injection site. To prevent this, the nurses will advise you to apply firm pressure at the injection site for 5-10 minutes. Immediate major side effects of the vaccines. Though it's rare, like any other vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines are allergenic for some individuals. This can manifest as body itching, body rash or lip swelling. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic response with low blood pressure and spasms of the respiratory tree. Fortunately, this is very rare. People who are susceptible to allergic reactions are vaccinated under medical supervision. Right, let's talk about the rare, serious side effects of the vaccine. 168 individuals out of the 21.2 million people who receive the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, were reported to have developed blood clots. Six individuals from more than 6.8 million people who received the Janssen's vaccine in the United States were reported to have developed similar clotting events. As a percentage, that is only 0.008 percent. The risk of getting blood clots from the corona disease itself is 10 times higher than getting it from vaccines. So, what do we know about this disorder? It is called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. As these individuals form blood clots or thrombosis, while they have low platelet counts or thrombocytopenia. Some clots are observed in large veins in the head. This is called cerebral venus sinus thrombosis. Danger signs are blurred vision or severe headache. Clots can rarely develop in the deep veins of the legs. This is called deep vein thrombosis. Danger signs are painful swelling of a leg. Chest pain and shortness of breath could indicate a clot in the arteries of the lungs. This is called pulmonary embolism. If you are pregnant, below 30, or have a clotting disorder inform your doctors, so they might suggest you an alternative vaccine. Both the Jensen vaccine and the AstraZeneca use an adenovirus as a vector to introduce genetic material. In contrast, both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine are mRNA vaccines. They are not considered to cause blood clots. China's CinoFarm vaccine injects an inactivative coronavirus called BBI-PV or V. So far, it is not reported to cause clotting disorders. So what about the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V? Though it's a vector-based vaccine like the Jensen's and AstraZeneca, Russian scientists claim that the Sputnik V doesn't cause blood clots. Since benefits outweigh the risk, I took the AstraZeneca vaccine. If you are a critical thinker in the field of medicine, comment why you would or wouldn't take the jab."
LONG TERM Side Effects That YOU NEED TO KNOW of SINOVAC and Other COVID 19 Vaccines,Doc Gerry Tan,2021-05-28,yYlDGG0iVEM,"One of the reasons why some people haven't signed up to receive COVID-19 vaccination is that they're worried that there might be a known long-term side effects that will show up months or years later. So if you like this video, please click subscribe, like and a notification bell to be updated for new videos to be uploaded every week. Although it is true that there are still a lot of things we're learning about the vaccines like how effective are they against the variants and how long their protection lasts. There are still plenty of things we do know that gives experts the confidence in the long-term safety of these vaccines. While concerns about the long-term effects of the vaccines are legitimate, it is important to be aware that the organized anti-vaccine industry has targeted this issue as a way to so doubt and confusion about COVID-19 vaccines. Patients of mine have received via messages, WhatsApp messages, asking them to refrain from getting the vaccines because of chips, because these vaccines will destroy their DNA, encouraging instead these patients to use products to protect against COVID-19, including drugs like Ibermectin, which we know has not been proven to protect patients against COVID-19 infection. What's known about the short-term effects of the vaccine is that these authorized COVID-19 vaccines, almost all of them, have similar short-term side effects. And these side effects typically occur within one to two days after the vaccine. Patients of the patients have already received probably the first or second dose, and they have noticed some form of headache, muscle fatigue, weakness, and even chills and fever. And this can be pretty normal to feel the symptoms because they can be unpleasant at times, but it's actually a good sign because it means that your body is in the process of generating an immune response to the vaccine. We also tell us that severe side effects, if they do occur, which they occur very rarely, usually happens within the first two months after giving the first dose. In fact, the most recent example of this phenomenon is the Johnson & Johnson, including the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines, which were put on hold when health officials learned that there were a small number of people who received the vaccine's that experienced serious blood clotting problem. But of note of the different several millions of people that have already received these vaccines, regulators investigated the handful of these patients and found that in the end, all these cases in terms of blood clots emerged within two weeks of vaccination. And upon reviewing the information of the different cases, the European medical agencies and the FDA finally have realized that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risk. The risk of blood clots, once you get COVID-19 infection, is so huge compared to the risk of these COVID-19 vaccines. So history shows that this is really a common pattern. So when new vaccines are released, the unknown side effects usually occurs within two months of the vaccinations. It goes back even to at least the 1960s with the oral polyvaccine. Now, because of this, scientists and public health officials continually monitor vaccine data before, during and after a vaccine becomes available to the public. So find it to note that these COVID-19 vaccine technologies have been started for years and use in other treatments without issue. Let's look at, let's say, the inactivated virus, which is being used in the sign of vaccine inactivated virus, is the same technology that we're used to because of the flu vaccine. And we've been using flu vaccines to all our patients with chronic conditions without any problems. So we're pretty safe with the use of sign of vac because it's an inactivated virus technology that we know of. But now we also have AstraZeneca. Now we also have Pfizer vaccines. And of course, this mRNA vaccine from Pfizer are very efficacious, but they're pretty new technology. So with mRNA viruses, instead of introducing the body to an inactivated or weakened version of the virus, a piece of it temporary turns the body cells into tiny vaccine making factories using the synthesized versions of something called mRNA. This instructs the body to make the spike proteins at SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter the cell. It in turns stimulates the body to make long lasting antibodies to the virus. Now to ensure that no protein is made in quantities greater than needed, the mRNA has a so-called poly-A tail. In the cytoplasm, this tail ensures mRNA decay. What does it mean? It slowly dissolves on its own. So that as mRNA is used to make proteins in the cell, the length of this poly-A tail decreases until it is too short for the mRNA to continue being used as a protein blueprint. So once this happens, the mRNA then breaks down and is removed as cellular debris. So this process therefore limits how long the mRNA remains in the cytoplasm and ensures it does not stay in the cell longer than it is needed to generate immunity. It is therefore unlikely for the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to alter the genetic information. Why? Because the mRNA in the vaccine does not enter the nucleus of the cell where the DNA is stored and it degrades rather quickly in the body after it serves its purpose. Suffice it to know for those who are getting the Pfizer vaccines that researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades, being used before for influenza, Zika and rabies. Beyond vaccines also, cancer who research has used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. The question among many is, you don't know the long-term effects of these vaccines. Well, that's always the case with new vaccines, but suffice it to note that the vaccine's side effects usually occur within the first couple of months after vaccination, which is why the FDA insisted on two-month safety data before authorizing them for public use. So adverse reports so far since then, since the emergency use of the RISD have not detected any patterns of death that would indicate the problem with the vaccines. Yes, many were alarmed by the reports from Norway that 23 people had died shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, but investigations have not shown that these deaths were the direct results of the vaccine. Similarly, you may have heard of some patients who probably died after a sign-of-vac or AstraZeneca vaccination. They'll remember. The priority list for our vaccinations are the diabetics, the elderly, the obese, those with cardiovascular disease. These are some sick people who will probably have had the problem of sudden cardiac death or stroke regardless of whether they received a vaccine or not. So my point is, with millions of people being vaccinated and thoroughly investigated, there is no way that the vaccine has a calcally-fac on death, most likely its coincidental, meaning had it not been given the vaccine, there would have been no issue if the patient suffered a sudden cardiac death. But since the patient was given one day or two days before the sudden cardiac death of a certain vaccine, we tend to blame the vaccine. So investigations with regard to death right after or several days after vaccinations have not been proven to show a calcally relationship with regard to the death and the vaccine. So if you look closely at different COVID-19 vaccines, the other vaccines available in the country is the AstraZeneca. And the AstraZeneca vaccine is a viral vector vaccine that uses a modified version of a different virus to deliver instructions that teach cells how to fight the coronavirus. In the case of the COVID-19 case, it's the adenovirus, which is a common cause and flu like symptoms. It is mod, it was however modified so that it can enter cells but can't replicate or cause an illness. So scientists, actually this is not new technology because viral vectors have been there since 1970s and they have been studied for genetic therapy and cancer treatment. In fact, some vaccines recently for Ebola outbreaks have used the viral vector technology and studies have focused on viral vectors vaccines against other infectious diseases like Zika, influenza and HIV. So for those of us who are so worried about long-term side effects because most of these vaccines have probably been produced properly, I want to assure you this. The vaccine development process from clinical trials to ongoing monitoring do help uncover and understand side effects because clinical trials are a key part of vaccine development and involve evaluating use in tens of thousands of study participants. Now, all of the COVID-19 vaccines went through this rigorous process before emergency use of authorization. So in reviewing the results from the trials, the FDA must determine the known potential benefits should outweigh the known potential risk of the vaccine. So after the vaccines are authorized and used by the public, public officials are urged to continue monitoring data as an additional safety measures. They will plan to report follow-up data, including any events such as hospitalizations and deaths and they must continue research to generate more data on the safety and efficacy. So in short, for my patients who are really worried about the long-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, please be aware that there's good news because the possible long-term side effects if they do occur, we should have seen them within the first six weeks of the dose. So far, we have not. That's why it is the FDA that insisted that each of these vaccines that being given to people must be studied for at least two months after the last dose, knowing that based on history of vaccinations, serious side effects almost always occur within six weeks to two months of getting the dose. So although some of these effects are long-term, like polyanarchalapcy, they still were picked up within six weeks. So my own opinion is in the pre-approved studies where the vaccines that have been tested in tens of thousands of people, you can therefore clearly say with confidence that there wasn't a relatively uncommon, serious side effects. Nothing. And now that the vaccine have been given to more than 10 million people worldwide, with clear, clapped real world data in terms of efficacy and preventing death and hospitalization, I think you can say with some confidence that there doesn't appear to be right now any rare serious side effect that would be something that would cause a long-term problem, nothing to alarm us or a signal that there may be something long-term to harm us. But again, we need to be humble. We need to keep our eyes open and look what happens as we vaccinate more people. Fortunately, there have been no reports of any additional problem with regard, except that these vaccines are verifications in protecting our people against COVID-19 infection, in protecting our people against COVID-19 serious events in terms of hospitalizations and death. Again, thank you very much. I am Dr. Jerry Tan. I hope to see you again in my future video."
"J&J, Sinopharm, Sputnik V COVID-19 shots less effective against Omicron, study shows",Reuters,2021-12-17,raJMdBncl2A,"Another setback for J&J, a study showed COVID-19 vaccines from Johnson and Johnson, as well as China's Sinopharm and Russia's Bhutanik V, had no neutralizing activity against Omicron variant. By contrast, the study done by the University of Washington, a unit of verb biotechnology, and others also found that shots from Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer-Biantech retained activity against the latest variant, but the antibody response was much less than with the original strain. It has been a challenging time for J&J. The news comes just one day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Americans get Moderna's or Pfizer-Biantech's COVID-19 vaccines over J&J's due to a rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood clotting. This more, its vaccine has the lowest uptake in the U.S. Earlier this year, Johnson and Johnson encountered quality issues at a plant that produces its single dose vaccine. As for the Russian shot, the Russian Direct Investment Fund set an statement the Bhutanik vaccine induces what it called a robust neutralizing antibody response to the Omicron variant, citing a preliminary study by the Gama-Leya Center."
Growing proportion of COVID deaths occur among vaccinated: analysis,Eyewitness News ABC7NY,2022-05-12,LVKSBHhGmDc,"It is a staggering number we never could have imagined. One million Americans now dead from COVID. And just moments ago, a moment of silence in the nation's capital lawmakers gathered on the capital steps to mark the somber milestone. Flags are being lowered to half-staff across the country. This is cases and hospitalizations are back on the rise. New Jersey reporting its highest positivity rates in January. Now nearly 17 percent. Connecticut is more than 13 percent and New York more than 7 percent. I would disuse to put a Lauren Glassberg is in the newsroom with more. Lauren? Shade, 1 million deaths nationwide, 112,440 of those in the Tri-State area alone. Those numbers are hard to process when a little more than a two years ago, things like positivity rates, PCR tests and pandemic weren't really part of our vocabulary, let alone part of our daily conversation. One million COVID deaths, one million empty chairs around the family dinner table. Each irreplaceable, irreplaceable losses. President Joe Biden addressed world leaders at a COVID summit today, the same day the United States reached the grim milestone of one million deaths due to the virus. He ordered flags lowered to half-staff and urged for a greater commitment to fight the virus worldwide. None of us who actually work on this type of problem expected that we would actually hit this type of milestone. Dr. J. Varma is an epidemiologist a while Cornell and has spent much of his career figuring out ways to predict pandemics. He says he couldn't have predicted how resilient this virus would be. The virus itself has proved to be an unpredictably formidable adversary. An unpredictable and invisible adversary that gained some advantage, he says, by a politicized pandemic response. The fact that it was invisible had turned things like masks and tests and mitigation measures and vaccines into something political, which has, I think, been a major contributor to why we've hit this very unfortunate milestone in deaths. And even now, 300 Americans die each day from COVID. New York governor, Kathy Hocal, who tested positive on Sunday, said in a statement about today's tragic milestone, let's remain vigilant against the virus and continue to look out for each other so we can move safely forward through this pandemic. And that is the point we are still going through this pandemic. Hospitalizations are at their highest level since mid-March. And now, next month, the FDA plans to discuss vaccines and whether they should be modified and later this summer, we might have more information on how frequently booster shots may be needed."
COVID-19: Singapore to review Sinovac vaccine data before deciding on use,CNA,2021-01-13,dbaLYtfQlsM,"At the same time, Singapore is to review vaccine data from Chinese drug from Sinovac before any possible rollout. Researchers in Brazil are already reporting that Sinovac is only 50 percent effective. Once we receive the data, HSA will go through its assessment, and then our expert committee will also make its assessment whether it's suitable for vaccination to be used for vaccination in Singapore. I think when that time comes and we share more details when it's available. Another vaccine candidate developed by US firm Moderna has submitted its data to Singapore's health sciences authority and is currently under review. At the moment only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved in Singapore. You don't know, right? No one knows when that preferred brand might come about. There's uncertainty. We have made purchases, but we don't know if it will be authorized because it's still pending data, pending review, pending approval. So rather than hold out and wait, I think what we have today is an authorized vaccine that is safe, that's effective."
Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine effective vs. Lambda variant,UNTV News and Rescue,2021-08-16,roJABtTOpkA,"Infectious disease expert Dr. Anna Ong Lim said that COVID-19 vaccines like synovac is still effective against any COVID-19 variants. She made the clarifications after reports that lumped the variant might have a much higher transmissibility. Based on the data they have released, synovac gave protection to those who have been inoculated with it in Chile and other Latin America countries. You know we don't even have to look at other countries. The predominantly the hospitalization rate of the vaccinated is significantly higher compared to that of the vaccinated. In the Philippines we have evidence to show that the people in the hospital are mostly vaccinated and in other places, they are also the same. Meanwhile, the first known local case of lambda variant in the country is still undergoing vaccination validation status. The DOH said they are continuously conducting back tracing of her close contacts. So, she apparently was put in a place where we are trying to coordinate apparently based on the record she is also pregnant. Most probable, it's a local case because we see among the persons in the community and the same situation is being put in the same place because apparently they are cluster and are still in sequence. The DOH once again reminds the public not to be complacent and continuously observe minimum public health standards implemented by the government. Icomigal, UNTV, News and Rescue. We serve the people we give glory to God."
The Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine: What you need to know,What’s Buzzing,2021-06-24,wkD6dVF7eAk,"As the global race to produce a COVID-19 vaccine continues, China appears to have made huge strides with vaccines from two front runners, Sinovac and Sinopharm, already making their way abroad. But what do we know about China's vaccines and how do they compare to those being developed elsewhere? The Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac is behind the coronavirus and inactivated the vaccine. It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. By comparison, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines being developed in the West are mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus's genetic code is injected into the body, triggering the body to begin making viral proteins, but not the whole virus, which is enough to train the immune system to attack. One of Sinovac's main advantages is that it can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius, like the Oxford vaccine, which is made from a genetically engineered virus that causes the common cold and chimpanzees. The Moderna vaccine needs to be stored at negative 20 Celsius and Pfizer's vaccine at negative 70 Celsius. It means that both Sinovac and the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine are a lot more useful to developing countries which might not be able to store large amounts of vaccine at such low temperatures. How efficacious is the vaccine? A large phase 3 trial in Brazil showed that two doses administered at an enroll of 14 days had an efficacy of 51 percent against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 100 percent against severe COVID-19, and 100 percent against hospitalization, starting in 14 days after receiving the second dose. What is the recommended dosage? Sage recommends the use of Sinovac coronavirus vaccine as two doses, half a milliliter, given intramuscularly. The WHO recommends an interval of two to four weeks between the first and second dose. It is recommended that all vaccinated individuals receive two doses. If the second dose is administered less than two weeks after the first, the dose does not need to be repeated. If administration of the second dose is delayed beyond four weeks, it should be given at the earliest possible opportunity. Who is eligible for the Sinovac vaccine? Eligible for use in adults 18 years and older. Eligible for consideration by individuals who are not able to take mRNA vaccines due to anaphylaxis. Does it work against new variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus? In an observational study, the estimated effectiveness of Sinovac, coronavirus, and health workers in Menace, Brazil, for P1 accounted for 75 percent of SARS-CoV-2 samples, was 49.6 percent against symptomatic infection. Effectiveness has also been shown in an observational study in São Paulo in the presence of P1 circulation, 83 percent of samples. Assessments in settings where the P2 variant of concern was widely circulating, also in Brazil, estimated vaccine effectiveness of 49.6 percent following at least one dose, and demonstrated 50.7 percent two weeks after the second dose. As new data becomes available, the WHO will update recommendations accordingly. Is it safe? Sage has thoroughly assessed the data on quality, safety, and efficacy of the vaccine, and has recommended its use for people aged 18 and above. Safety data is currently limited for persons above 60 years of age, due to the small number of participants in clinical trials. While no differences in safety profile of the vaccine in older adults compared to younger age groups can be anticipated, countries considering using this vaccine in persons older than 60 years should maintain active safety monitoring. How does this vaccine compare to other vaccines already in use? We cannot compare the vaccines head-to-head, due to the different approaches taking and designing the respective studies, but overall, all of the vaccines that have achieved WHO emergency use listing are highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospitalization due to COVID-19. Side effects The five most common adverse side effects of Sinovax COVID-19 vaccine are elevated blood pressure, headache, injection site pain, dizziness, and rash. A.E. FIC member Dr. Ilyin Kuhuzhengko said the time it takes for adverse events to appear various, but most of them are transient and indicate that the body's immune system is responding to the vaccine. The vaccine side effects can appear soon after, like if the patient has stress-related response, it can be even less than five minutes, she told a briefing. If the patient has an allergy, it can be in the next 30 minutes or an hour. It varies, depending on the response, or it can even be like general pain, fatigue, my algae. The muscle pain that appears one to three days or as late as five to seven days, she added. Should pregnant women be vaccinated? The available data on the Sinovax coronavirus vaccine in pregnant women are insufficient to assess either vaccine efficacy or possible vaccine-associated risks and pregnancy. However, this vaccine is an inactivated vaccine with an adjuvant that is commonly used in many other vaccines with a well-documented safety profile, such as hepatitis B and tetanus vaccines, including in pregnant women. The effectiveness of the Sinovax coronavirus vaccine in pregnant women is therefore expected to be comparable to that observed in non-pregnant women of similar age. Further studies are expected to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women. In the interim, the WHO recommends the use of the Sinovax coronavirus vaccine in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant women outweigh the potential risks. To help pregnant women make this assessment, they should be provided with information about the risks of COVID-19 in pregnancy, the likely benefits of vaccination in the local and epidemiological context, and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women. The WHO does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination. The WHO does not recommend delaying pregnancy or considering terminating pregnancy because of vaccination. Who else can take the vaccine? Vaccination is recommended for persons with comorbidities that have been identified as increasing the risk of severe COVID-19, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. The vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. Several data shows that symptomatic reinfection is unlikely in these persons for up to six months after natural infection. That's probably it. They may choose to delay vaccination to nearer the end of this period, especially when vaccine supply is limited. In the meantime, WHO reminds of the need to stay the course and continue practicing public health and safety measures that should be used as a comprehensive approach to prevent infection and transmission. These measures include wearing a mask, physical distancing, hand washing, respiratory and cough hygiene, avoiding crowds, and ensuring adequate ventilation according to local national advice."
Fact check: Are more vaccinated people now dying of COVID-19 than unvaccinated?,CBS 17,2022-08-24,V9Z325DYJJc,"there's a new chart making the rounds on social media and it's easy to misinterpret what it's telling you. It appears to say most people dying if COVID-19 lately are actually fully vaccinated. CBS 17 digital reporter Johnny Macquarie is back checking it. Now what this chart shows is deaths in vaccinated people now out number those among the unvaccinated, but an expert tells me it leaves out a very important detail how to look closer at this chart you may have seen online. At some point after February, weekly deaths in vaccinated people surpassed those who didn't get a vaccine. That's the black line moving over the blue one. But UNC doctor David Weber says what it's missing is age. Most the cases we're seeing now of death so many of them are in older people much like we saw it two years ago. The majority of older people in the United States have been vaccinated. The majority of the population are in the states. The majority of the people who are vaccinated. The majority of deaths will be in people who are vaccinated. That's why the chart from the state Department of Health and Human Services includes a key phrase, age adjusted. The real question is not what percentage of deaths are hospitalization are in vaccinated or in unvaccinated. It's a very important question. The question is, what age group is that? The risk of death in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals. And because we know immunity fades over time, it also highlights how important boosters are, including the ones coming soon that target the oma Crohn variants. So that's really the question that you need to ask is vaccinated versus unvaccinated. What age group? And what age group do you need to ask is vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals? And what age group do you need to ask is vaccinated versus unvaccinated. What age group do you"
PH receives 1-M additional Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines | ANC,ANC 24/7,2021-06-27,VqJs_Lwuvzw,"The Philippines vaccine supply gets a back-to-back boost. One million additional doses of Sinobax COVID-19 vaccine arrived this morning. The fresh batch of the Chinese vaccine will be distributed to areas facing COVID-19 surges. The Philippines has so far received 17.4 million COVID-19 vaccine doses. 12 million of which were from Sinobax. The Philippines received 10 million. The vaccine is now 100 percent in health workers. In terms of the list, we have received 1,600,000 health workers. We are now pursuing the second dose. The Philippines also received its first shipment of nearly 250,000 Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.

Drilon urges gov't to rethink buying Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines with 50% efficacy,Rappler,2020-12-25,zAIwudnaPWU,"Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drellon Cauchons the government against obtaining COVID-19 vaccines from Chinese pharmaceutical company SinuVac. He says SinuVac's 50 percent efficacy, quote unquote, clearly pills in comparison with Pfizer's 95 percent, Moderna's 94.1 percent and even AstraZeneca's 70 percent. He doubts how the 50 percent efficacy can build public trust and confidence in vaccines. The Philippine government is expecting a shipment of the SinuVac vaccine to arrive by March 2021. It will be among the first COVID-19 vaccines to be administered to Filipinos. Presidential spokesperson Harry Rockey on December 15 defends the purchase of the SinuVac vaccine, saying it is behind in the queue for the once-by-fizer Moderna and AstraZeneca ."
Real-world study shows China's Sinovac vaccine 98% effective in preventing deaths among Indonesians,CGTN Global Watch,2021-05-21,qu1DUJ04_lw,"For the past one year, Brahmita has been working at a COVID-19 award. Every day she treats hundreds of patients dealing with a virus. She saw firsthand how the pandemic put a massive strain on Indonesia's healthcare system. When the pandemic began, it was overwhelming for our hospital because at the time there were many patients, but only three ventilators in the ICU. The Indonesia Doctors Association confirmed that more than 500 health workers died of COVID-19 in 2020. Those numbers were alarming, and for Brahmita, the Cinevac vaccine offered hope. I'm thankful the government prioritized health workers for the vaccination program because we're the frontliners. I'm also glad that in my experience, both doses of Cinevac didn't give me any side effects. A recent study by Indonesia's health ministry showed that Cinevac is 98 percent effective in reducing the number of COVID-19 deaths among health workers. We appreciate the result. We're happy with the result, but this is not the end. We still have to make another trial and continuously regular. We have a vaccine hesitancy. Let's say 20 percent of Indonesian population don't believe, doesn't believe about the pandemic exists. That's 20 percent. 20 percent is 50 million. The government is hoping with this recent study, the public would be more comfortable in receiving the Cinevac vaccine. Indonesia's health ministry aims to vaccinate 181 million people by January 2022. But experts say at this point, that seems unlikely. We talked about with the government about the rest of the week. I told that that the community is that's a long term goal that wanting and so many of the program that they have to do now is containing the decals of the 19 by the pandemic, sending the testing, and also not only testing, but without the isolation and quarantine program. Testing and dressing will not have a significant impact. Indonesia has been experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks in Southeast Asia. In January 2021, the government raised their budget for the National Economic Recovery Program, hoping to speed up economic growth in the country. Salkina Alualia, C.J. T.N. Chakarta."
Brazilian City Sees COVID 19 Deaths Fall by 95% After Sinovac Vaccine Used,Living Stories,2021-06-02,VD7oULXSDLI,"After all adult residents of the Brazilian city of Serrano were offered a trial sign of ac vaccine, deaths have decreased by 95 percent in the community.On top of the falling death rates, the city of 46,000 has also seen hospitalizations go down by 86 percent and symptomatic cases go down by 80 percent — the Associated Press reported. The improvements have established Serrano as a unique refuge from the increasing outbreaks and uncertainty in other parts of the world, where now as full as we used to be, Raj and Iqute, Rio Silva, an employee for a store that sells cheap refreshments and snacks, said in an interview. Weeks ago, people wouldn't form a line in here, wouldn't eat in, and I wouldn't let them use the bathroom. Now it's back only one person with COVID-19, a 63-year-old woman, is currently in critical condition in Serrano's Dr. Haraldo Cesar Rees Clinic. The 63-year-old woman refused the sign of ac vaccine to wait for a Pfizer dose instead, but most of those eligible chose to participate in the trial.The Associated Press reported, the World Health Organization approved the sign of ac vaccine for emergency use for people 18 and older Tuesday.The second vaccine authorization of the kind for the developer, for more reporting from the Associated Press, see below, the experiment known as Project S, lasted four months and tested sign of acs shot in real-world conditions. The preliminary results made public Monday suggest the pandemic can be controlled if three-quarters of the population is fully vaccinated with sign of ac, said Ricardo Palacios, a director at São Paulo states Patanthen Institute and Coordinator of the study, which was not peer-reviewed.The most important result was understanding that we can control the pandemic even without vaccinating the entire population. Palacios said, the results offer hope to hundreds of millions of people, especially in developing nations. Egypt, Pakistan, Indonesia, Zimbabwe and others are also reliant on the Chinese shot, which is cheaper than vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna.The city's population was split into four geographic areas regardless of age and gender, and most adults received two shots by the end of April. This released Monday showed that the pandemic was controlled after three of the areas had been vaccinated. It was not clear if vaccine uptake was the same in each area, the project shows the protection exists and that the vaccine is effective. No doubt Gonzalo Vecena, one of the founders of Brazil's Health Regulator and a Medical School Professor, told the Associated Press, Likewise, Denise Garrett, Vice President of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, which advocates for expanding global vaccine access, called the results good and very encouraging, and both Vecena and Garrett said unanswered questions remain and that more data is needed to properly analyze the results, including information about people who got shots but did not develop immunity.The city's population was split into four geographic areas regardless of age and gender, and most adults received two shots by the end of April.

The upswing was largely blamed on more contagious variants, hospitals in Riberaud Preto are so full of COVID-19 patients that the mayor imposed strict shutdown measures last week, including halting public transportation and limiting hours for the city's 700,000 residents to buy groceries. Some will wait months for their vaccines, almost all shops are closed, and 95 percent of intensive pair unit beds are occupied by virus patients. El Mano Silvera, 54, works at a local drug store and for the first time wishes he lived in Serrana, which was looked down upon before the vaccination drive, my friends from their use to call me all the time. Now I'm the one calling them, Silvera said. Before the pandemic, we had a big city vibe here, it was really busy. Now it's like a desert, just months ago, it was Serrana struggling to cope, according to Dr. Joe and Atilda O'Antonio Madalozo Jr. For every patient who recovered in the first three months of 2021, two more arrived in bad shape, he said."
FDA approves Novavax's updated COVID-19 vaccine,Yahoo Finance,2023-10-03,oR4JMYmHKjM,"We have some late breaking news here. Nova Vax is updated COVID vaccine approved by the food and drug administration. The shot still needs an updated recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control. But the company says that should be happening quote, imminently. And once that recommendation comes, the vaccine will be available for available for patients at pharmacies, doctors offices and distribution centers. This news coming just weeks after Pfizer and return is updated vaccines became available. Shares of Nova Vax up about 12 and a half percent on the news. And Nova Vax has said it is ready to ship six million doses of this vaccine once it does get the CDC approval as well. Yeah, it means it's the rollout though of some rivals has been kind of bumpy, right? I mean, we saw in the government green, give the green light to Pfizer and Moderna, but you've heard these issues of not just insurance issues, but availability issues too. Right, exactly. And Nova Vax has been viewed sort of as an also ran in some quarters because it was so late to the game to get approval for its vaccine, which of course uses a different type of biotechnology than do the mRNA vaccine. It's more of a traditional formulation, if you will. So it'll be interesting to see what the uptake is of Nova Vax versus, you know, even if you can't find the others, will people be as willing to try this one? I think that remains an open question, but for, you know, a single product company, like so many of these the smaller players in this industry are, there's a lot riding on that uptake for the likes of Nova Vax. Down day investors like to look at that, taking up about 13 percent."
What Are Side Effects of the Novavax COVID Vaccine? (Novavax Now Approved in US).  Doctor Explains,Dr. Jen Caudle,2022-07-22,0l2jjH26uE0,"Exciting news, the NOVAVAX vaccine has been approved for use in the United States. This NOVAVAX vaccine is a COVID vaccine. It is the fourth COVID vaccine to be approved for use in the United States, and it uses a different technology than those of the mRNA vaccines and that of Johnson and Johnson. In fact, the technology that NOVAX uses is similar to the technology in the flu shot and the shingles vaccine and many other vaccines that we're already familiar with. It's 90 percent effective. The side effects are very similar to the other vaccines. The risk of myocarditis does exist, but that risk is low. Remember the risk of myocarditis or heart inflammation after getting COVID itself is much higher. Guys, this offers another option for people. If you've not been comfortable with Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson and Johnson, this might be the vaccine that helps get you vaccinated against COVID. Make sure, oh, by the way, it's 2 doses for 18, those 18 years of age and older, 2 doses separated by 3 weeks has gotten emergency use authorization. Stay tuned for more information. Make sure you ask your doctor about it."
What you need to know about Novavax,Riverside Health,2022-07-25,XD-Bu6SAEwg,"It's very exciting news that on July 19th, the CDC authorized the use of another COVID-19 vaccine from NOVAVAX. What makes this vaccine different is that it is based on a different vaccine technology. It's a protein-based vaccine. Protein-based vaccines have been used in the United States for over 30 years. And so this may be an option for those individuals that have not yet been vaccinated because they were concerned about the messenger RNA technology. So the NOVAVAX vaccine that was authorized by the CDC is a two-dose primary series at this point. And so it would be intended for those 18 years of age and older that have not yet been vaccinated in the United States. We do anticipate that there will be booster dose development over time and perhaps even expansion to other age groups. But for now it's 18 and above two-dose primary series given 21 days to eight weeks apart for those 18 years and older. So when we think about other vaccines that have used the protein-based formulations, some of those that have been used for a number of years include hepatitis B. That was the first vaccine developed over 30 years ago. We also use that technology for flu vaccine and some of the childhood vaccinations such as whooping call. The side effects of this vaccine are very similar to what we see with other protein-based vaccines such as the influenza vaccine or other COVID-19 vaccines. So the most common things that you may see would be pain at injection site. Perhaps a little bit of fatigue the day after you get the injection. You may have mild headache, mild fever, and some mild joint and muscle pain. One of the things that you may be hearing is that there's come some concern about vaccine efficacy waning over time, especially with the newer variants that are circulating. Currently in the United States as well as in Virginia, BA-5 is the predominant variant and BA-4 closely behind that. The vaccines that were originally developed were not developed for these variants and so while they still provide very good coverage, very good protection against serious illness, hospitalization, and death, we do know that they're not as robust about against just preventing disease. So there are a couple things that are happening right now. The FDA is working with all vaccine manufacturers to develop variant specific vaccines with the goal of having those vaccines available by the fall in the United States. Additionally, the NOBA vaccine that was just approved while it was developed when before Omicron was circulating and when other variants were predominant. Some recent information out of Australia as well as the United Kingdom shows that a booster dose, which is not yet authorized in the US, but maybe soon, a booster dose actually has very good efficacy against Omicron. So there are several options that we expect will be available over the next few months, so stay aware and informed about your options for those booster doses. NOBA Vax actually was part of the original operation warp speed and NOBA Vax has been available in other parts of the world for some period of time. But when they got ready to launch in the United States, there were some manufacturing capacity concerns and NOBA Vax wanted to make sure that they had the full capacity to support what the United States needed, hence why they waited until earlier this spring to present information to the Food and Drug Administration for authorization. Riverside is currently working with Virginia Department of Health on when the NOBA Vax vaccine will be available for us to order. We know the United States has purchased doses of this vaccine, so like all of the other COVID-19 vaccines, it will be provided free of charge. As soon as it's available, Riverside does intend to offer this vaccine, both to team members that perhaps have not yet been vaccinated because of a medical or religious exemption due to messenger RNA vaccines or at community-based clinics."
The Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine Explained,UC Davis Health,2022-06-09,64sbMN4w7Vo,"The Pfizer, Biantec, and Moderna vaccines are the messenger RNA vaccine. And then the Novavax is more of a traditional protein-based vaccine, where the protein is made in actually made in moth cells and then it's concentrated and harvested from the moth cells and then that protein, the spike protein, then is included in the vaccine. So it's very similar to a tetanus, diphtheria vaccine, to hepatitis B vaccine, for example. So it's very similar to other vaccines that were routinely used to getting it. It's very similar to the other vaccines with the side effects. So it's an intramuscular injection, it's two doses. I'm a does result pain and so onus at the injection site, maybe some swelling and redness and maybe some fatigue. There's more side effects after the second dose compared to the first dose, but the side effects between the vaccines are basically very similar."
"Latest FDA Novavax approval, new long COVID study data, plus CDC updates STI treatment guidelines",AMA Update | American Medical Association,2023-10-11,q-GYxA2BMfQ,"Hello and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast. Today we have our weekly look at the headlines with the AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia in Chicago. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's Chief Experience Officer, also in Chicago. Welcome back Andrea. Todd, thanks. It's great to be here. Well, Andrea, let's start with some big news from last week. It looks like we have another COVID vaccine to choose from. What's the story here? Yeah, that's right. Last week we saw the FDA authorized the updated Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. And that's for anyone aged 12 and older, who has not already received their updated mRNA vaccine. Just as a reminder, the Novavax vaccine relies on protein-based technology and that's to train the immune system to fight that virus that causes COVID-19. It's a different technology from Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccine. Novavax vaccine has been updated to target the XBB 1.5 Omicron Siberian. And we know it's also been shown to be effective against EG5, which is the dominant strain here in the US as a part of that FDA authorization that original Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is no longer authorized for use in the US. So just to clarify, are we waiting on the CDC's recommendation now? The Novavax vaccine has already been recommended by the CDC in September when the advisory committee on immunization practices met to review those updated COVID-19 vaccine. The first question included information on Novavax. It wasn't yet authorized by FDA at the time, but Novavax did present their data to ACIP. And they voted to broadly recommend the vaccines that are authorized by the FDA for the 2023-2024 season. And then we saw in a statement this past Monday, Novavax said that they've already shipped millions of doses to distributors. And the vaccine should start to be available sometime this week in thousands of locations across the US, including pharmacies and physician offices. And I just got my COVID vaccine over the weekend, and I was walking out and I said, oh, no, I forgot my vaccine card before realizing this was no longer necessary. So on this topic, the CDC shared information about the future of those now iconic vaccination cards that we used to use in the pandemic. What's the news there? Yeah, so we saw CDC say they're no longer going to be distributing that those vaccine cards, which up until this point, as you were saying, those have been updated regularly with people's updated booster information. The CDC did encourage people to contact their state health department immunization information system or IIS if they want to keep track of their vaccination history, including COVID-19 vaccines. Your state health department to be clear is not going to issue you a vaccination card, but they can provide a digital or paper copy of your vaccine record. According to the majority of pharmacy chains, you don't need your old card to get that updated vaccine. Some pharmacies have said people are bringing in their vaccination cards to their appointments and pharmacists will still fill in that information with the new dose. It's also worth noting that the US government is no longer requiring people to show their vaccination card when they're coming in from outside of the country. And most other countries have also stopped requiring that proof of vaccination to enter, but it's still, of course, obviously wise to check with your destination before leaving the US. How times change and for the better staying on the COVID that subject for a moment there was a new study with findings that could one day help to treat diagnosed long COVID better Andrea, tell us more about that. So that study was published in nature and it used blood tests to identify biological markers that could be associated with long COVID. The researchers took advantage of machine learning to analyze those immune markers and hormone levels in about 270 adult participants. They were not allowed to include those with and without long COVID symptoms, at least one year after having COVID. And the found the activity of T cells and B cells was irregular in those patients who had long COVID. Now one of the strongest predictors of long COVID was that these patients tend to have lower cortisol levels. And they're not going to be able to explain why many people with long COVID experience that profound fatigue. The study also found that some dormant viruses like the ones that cause mononucleosis or Epstein bar can activate again in long COVID patients. It's not clear yet whether the dormant viruses are causing symptoms or they're fleeing a problem with the immune system. So a small study so more research is going to be needed to understand the significance of these results. But still I think finding those clear differences and blood biomarkers of people with long COVID could be a key first step in helping us develop a test to help diagnose the illness and develop future treatments. That would be really, really important. And do we have any recent data on how many people have been affected by long COVID. Yes, so we have estimates of people in the US with lingering COVID symptoms, which we know very, very widely. In a new survey from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, they say long COVID may have affected as many as 962,000 children and 17.9 million adults. So in 2022, about 1.3 percent of kids and 6.9 percent of adults had ever had long COVID. The survey showed that long COVID was most prevalent in women and people who are Hispanic adults who lived in rural areas and adults age 35 to 49. It also showed that Asian adults were the least likely to have long COVID as were people whose family income was 400 percent more than the federal poverty level. Long COVID does remain rare in children. However, the survey showed that it was most prevalent in girls in kids ages 12 to 17 and in kids who are Hispanic. Certainly still have a lot to learn there, but good that we're seeing those continued efforts and understanding on COVID. Andrea, we're going to switch gears from COVID to a different topic. CDC also released guidance for a tool to help fight sexually transmitted infections. What do we need to know there? The last week we saw the CDC released draft recommendations on the use of post exposure profile access with doxycycline or doxypep for preventing some bacterial sexually transmitted infections or STIs. That includes chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. Those recommendations are based on research that found 1,200 milligram dose of doxycycline, maybe effective in preventing infections. If it's taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, this is different from that traditional approach of prescribing antibiotics to treat an infection after their diagnosed. The clinical trial, the combined incidence of gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis was lower by 2,3 with doxypep than following the standard of care. The CDC recommendations for doxypep would apply to men who have sex with men and transgender women in an interview with CBS news, CDC's Dr. Jonathan Merman, who was a co-author of the draft recommendations said it's going to take game changing innovations for us to turn the STI epidemic around and doxypep is the first major new prevention intervention we have for STIs in decades. Dr. Merman went on to say that the implementation of the doxypep approach could prevent an estimated tens of thousands of infections. Those are some pretty sizable numbers. Andrea, you said that these are draft recommendations, so what happens next year? Yeah, so that's right. And the CDC right now is seeking public comment on its proposal and that comment period is open until November 16th. This gives clinicians people affected by STIs and other partners the opportunity to weigh in before we see CDC finalize those recommendations. The FDA has not officially approved the medication for STI post-exposure prophylaxis, but doxypep will remain available as an off-label prescription when used for STI prevention. These draft recommendations come at a time when the rates of STIs have risen across the US. We know there were 2.5 million STI cases reported in 2021. That represents a 7 percent increase from the year before. I think it's also important to note that the CDC's experts on antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic stewardship did provide consultation during the development of these guidelines and they're involved in planning how CDC is going to attract the impact of these guidelines, because there are important questions that remain around the development of antimicrobial resistance. For example, as well as the effectiveness of this approach for other populations and impacts on the microbiome, we don't know yet when the final recommendations are expected, but will continue to monitor the story and share any updates as they become available. Andrea, thank you so much for that update and for your perspective as usual. That wraps up today's episode.

"Novavax vaccine questions answered with Sandra Fryhofer, MD | AMA COVID-19 Update",COVID-19 Update | American Medical Association,2022-08-01,1sE9roUR4mM,"Hello, this is the American Medical Association's COVID-19 update. Today we're discussing the latest recommendations from ACIP on the newest COVID vaccine, NOVAVAX. Who can get it and when dosing as well as details about side effects including the risk of myocarditis? I'm joined today by Dr. Sandra Freihopher, AMAs liaison to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP and a member of ACIP's COVID-19 Vaccine Work Group. Dr. Freihopher is also the chair of the AMA Board of Trustees. I'm Todd Unger, AMAs Chief Experience Officer in Chicago. Welcome back, Dr. Freihopher. We're going to start by giving getting some details about this new COVID vaccine NOVAVAX. We tell us who can get it and how it's different from other COVID vaccines. Well Todd, this is very exciting news. We now have a third type of vaccine in the fight against COVID. A Tudor series of NOVAVAX Protein Subunit COVID Vaccine is now recommended for unvaccinated adults 18 and older for primary vaccination against COVID. This protein-based platform is new for COVID vaccines, but it's not really new. This technology has been around for more than 30 years. It's already been used in making other vaccines, for example, for flu, hepatitis B, and woping cough. This vaccine contains harmless spike protein subunits with an adjuvant added to boost immune response and unlike mRNA vaccines, protein-based vaccines do not contain any genetic material. Our vast experience with protein subunit vaccines should be reassuring to those who worry about the newness of mRNA vaccine technology and as many as 26 to 37 million US adults have not yet been vaccinated. And I hope this more traditional technology platform will convince some of these vaccine holdouts to roll up their sleeves. The United States already has 3.2 million NOVAVAX doses ready to ship. That's great news. I just want to key on on one thing you said. You said that NOVAVAX is for primary vaccination. Can it be used as a booster at this point? No. NOVAVAX can only be used since a primary series. FDA has not authorized it as a booster yet. However, there's a lot of interest in the prospect of using NOVAVAX as a booster, especially since mRNA vaccines don't seem to be that durable. And this was a big topic of discussion at the ACIP meeting. The company says they'll be submitting booster data to FDA really soon. FDA representative said that booster data would be reviewed very quickly as quickly as possible once that data is submitted. The company also announced it started a study in May looking at NOVAVAX boosters after an mRNA primary vaccine series. This study has five different arms and will test various types of NOVAVAX boosters. The original version as well as Omicron specific monovalant and bivalant boosters. So more to come, but to be clear, right now it's only recommended as a two-dose primary series. You can't give NOVAVAX boosters at least for now. All right, that's very definitive. Let's talk about effectiveness. How well does it work? And does it work as well as the mRNA vaccines and will it work against Omicron? Well, great questions. The study data submitted to FDA says overall it was about 90 percent effective at preventing COVID. However, it did not seem to work quite as well in those 65 and older vaccine efficacy in this older group was 79 percent and for some unexplained reason for which there's no, does it make any physiological sense? Vaccine efficacy in those of Hispanic ethnicity was also a little lower at 77 percent. But here's the catch. The studies submitted to FDA were done before Omicron started circulating. So we just don't know how it will work against Omicron. The NOVAVAX studies were done during a time when the alpha variant was predominant and a South African study showed that NOVAVAX was only 51 percent effective against the beta variant. The Omicron surge started in December 2021 and still dominates. Omicron's BA5 sub lineage now makes up 65 percent and BA4 makes up 16.3 percent of specimens tested and who knows what variants next on the menu. And we really can't compare vaccine effectiveness of NOVAVAX to that at mRNA vaccines based on the data that we currently have available. How does NOVAVAX compare as far as side effects to mRNA vaccines and what about myocarditis? Is that also a concern? Well, just like the mRNA vaccines, these vaccines are reactogenic. So expect the TIG, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, maybe some nausea, vomiting, maybe a little fever. These side effects usually go away within one to two days. And unfortunately, as we've seen with the mRNA vaccines, there have been reports of myocarditis and pericarditis after NOVAVAX during the clinical trials and also in early post-authorization data. We know that the risk of heart complications is higher after COVID disease than after mRNA COVID vaccination among males and females of all ages. However, we can't directly compare myocarditis rates between NOVAVAX and mRNA vaccines based on currently available data. Now, in the NOVAVAX clinical safety study, there were only four to six cases identified out of more than 40,000 vaccine recipients. As of the beginning of May of 2022, nearly 750,000 doses of NOVAVAX had been administered in other countries and global post-marketing safety data have revealed 36 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis. Myocarditis risk was addressed by the FDA and its guidance fact sheets. And FDA explains the chance of myocarditis is very low, but it can occur usually within 10 days following vaccination. It also says patients that have chest pain, shortness of breath, the fast heartbeat, heart fluttering, or a pounding heart should seek medical care right away. Post-authorization safety monitoring will continue and will be so important in further defining myocarditis risk. Dr. Freihoper, a lot of our listeners are physicians out there that administer vaccines. Can you talk about some of the specific details regarding storage, administration, and dosing? Sure. It comes in 10 dose files and it's preservative free. A dose is half a CC and contains five micrograms of protein subunit antigen along with 50 micrograms of a proprietary adjuvant matrix M, which boosts the immune response and you give it intramusculally in the deltoid muscle. NOVAVAX has several logistical advantages. It's easy to store, easy to prepare, and easy to administer. You stored it regularly for greater temperatures, but don't freeze it. No delusions necessary, but vaccine has to be discarded if it's not used within six hours after the first puncture of the vial. And because there are 10 doses in each vial, it's likely that there will be some doses wasted, which is unfortunate. One thing that was expected and is somewhat inconvenient, there's no expiration date printed on the vial or on the carton. And you have to go to a website, NOVAVAXCOVIDVaxing.com to check for the expiration date. Interesting. Well, let's think about the dosing part specifically. How long does it take to complete the series? Well, in the study, vaccine doses were administered three weeks apart. However, CDC guidance says you can extend the interval between doses to as long as eight weeks. This extended interval guidance is based on data from mRNA vaccines. There are no specific data on extended intervals for NOVAVAX. And this is all based on the mRNA vaccine studies. Some studies of mRNA vaccines have indicated a lower risk of myocarditis and greater immune response with that extended interval. The eight-week interval could be considered, especially in young adult males, to reduce potential for myocarditis and at the same time optimize vaccine effectiveness. This extended interval recommendation does not apply to those with immunocompromising conditions. CDC recommends sticking to that three-week interval for patients with immunocompromising conditions so we can get them, their immune, their protection built up as quickly as possible. And NOVAVAX has to be used for both doses in the primary series. I repeat, the same vaccine product should be used for both doses in that primary series. You can't mix and match with a different product or type. Well, unfortunately, we're finding that COVID out there is not happening in isolation. One thing that is coming up, we've been or not, is flu season, which will soon be upon us. Can NOVAVAX be administered at the same time as other vaccines? Well, good news there. It's fine to give flu shots and COVID vaccines at the same time, and that also goes for the NOVAVAX vaccine. Also, there's no problem giving NOVAVAX or any of the other COVID vaccines with other vaccines with one exception, orthoprox virus vaccines. Now, we're in the middle of a monkeypox outbreak. ACAM 2000 in Genia, so the two vaccines available for orthoprox viruses. ACAM 2000 has been linked to myocarditis. We don't know if there's an increased risk of myocarditis with Genia's yet, but if you've received a dose of one of these orthoprox vaccines, CDC suggests waiting four weeks to get a COVID vaccine dose. However, if you've already received a COVID vaccine and you're now at risk of monkeypox due to exposure, no need to wait. Go ahead and get the monkeypox vaccine dose now. And remember, NOVAVAX and other COVID vaccines are reactogenic and can have significant side effects. The shingles vaccine, Shingricks, also is very reactogenic. So you might want to think twice about giving both shingles vaccine and COVID vaccine on the same day. Any final thoughts regarding NOVAVAX? The COVID pandemic has contributed to health inequities. American Indian and Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic and Latino persons have been disproportionately affected by COVID-associated hospitalizations and deaths. COVID vaccines represent a potential way to decrease disparities over time. We know that vaccination prevents COVID cases, hospitalization, and death. As of July 2022, more than 599 million doses of COVID vaccines have been administered in the US, but about 26 to 37 million US adults have not yet received even a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine. I hope that having this more traditional vaccine platform option available will move the needle for at least some of those still not vaccinated. And at least for now, this vaccine is available free of charge. That's great news. Thank you so much, Dr. Fryhofer, as always, for sharing your expertise and that detailed report that wraps up our COVID-19 update for today. And we'll be back soon with another update video and podcast soon. For resources on COVID-19, visit AMA-ASSN.org-COVID-19. Thanks for joining us today, and please take care."
What Is the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine?,The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,2022-06-14,s58a53Fxr9s,"I'm talking to you today Thursday, June 9th, from the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. What I want to talk about is a new vaccine, a new weapon in this fight against COVID. So on June 7th, two days ago, the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccine Advisory Committee met to discuss a vaccine that's made by Novavax. Now, this vaccine is a different strategy than the previous Pfizer vaccine or Moderna vaccine. Because the way those vaccines work is you give the person the gene that codes for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the surface protein, and then your body, cells in your body, make that protein. That's the way those two vaccines work. And the antibodies that you make then against that protein, that surface protein, prevent the virus from binding to cells and therefore protect you. This is a different strategy. Here, instead of giving the gene the toads for the protein, you actually give the protein itself. You give the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It's adjuvanted with an adjuvant that is called Matrix M, that is the same adjuvant that should have been used in Schingrichs now for about five years. So there's a lot of experience with that adjuvant. And most importantly, I think this particular technology, giving the protein itself to induce an immune response, is a well-worn technology. We've been using it to make the hepatitis B vaccine for 30 years. And we also use the same strategy to make the human papillomavirus vaccine and one of the influenza vaccines called flu block. So what do we know about this vaccine so far? What we know is that in the groups that were tested so far, which is about a 30,000 person study, that the vaccine is very likely to protect against moderate to severe disease caused by the current circulating strains. I think we also know that it's generally safe, but there were a few cases, three cases of young men who, after the second dose of the vaccine, had mild short-lived transient myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle. That's very similar to what was seen with the mRNA vaccines. Now, we'll see whether or not this holds up when the vaccine is given to more people, but it is a concern. And I think that we'll be looking at this to see whether or not what happened with the mRNA vaccines might also be true with this particular vaccine. Thank you."
What is the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine?,ChristianaCare,2022-09-13,5WJ6qn17Nww,"The Nova Vax vaccine is a new vaccine that was actually approved back in June and it's different in that it relies on very traditional technology. It's known as a protein subunit vaccine. It's been used for all sorts of different vaccines in the past, so it's a very known quantity. Now it is based on the original strain of COVID, but it has similar protection as the mRNA vaccines in terms of hospitalizations and severe disease and death. So if you're still hesitant about getting a COVID vaccine because you're worried about the mRNA technology, not that I think you should be, but if you are, then the Nova Vax vaccine may be a great option for you because it is very much a known quantity in terms of the technology that's used for the vaccine. It is approved only for 18 and up and it is approved only for the primary series, but certainly having the primary series at this point is still much better than being unvaccinated."
How does the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine work?,CityNews,2022-02-26,L5CDgfSxVGw,"The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Novavax, has finally been approved for use in Canada, and some experts say that it might win over those who have been hesitant to take the shot thus far, because it's not an mRNA vaccine. So how exactly is it different and how does it work? And infectious disease doctor explains. Novavax is a type of vaccine that's probably more familiar to people because in most of the vaccines we get are actually made out of some component of the infectious disease of the pathogen. In this case we're getting a little piece of the protein that the virus produces. Dr. Alon Vazeman explains that Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines provide the body with the genetic code of the virus protein. The body then makes that protein which in turn triggers the immune system to attack it as an unknown entity. In a way, Novavax skips ahead one step. It's set up using our own bodies machinery to create that protein. This is vaccine just gives it to us and shows our immune system the foreign antigen, which is what we use to create our antibodies. So it says here's what it looks like. Produce the antibodies to this. Next time you see something like this, next time you should attack it. Dr. Vazeman says mRNA vaccines were the first out the gate because the genetic sequence of the virus was determined very early on in the pandemic, but it is a common misconception that the vaccine that took longer to develop and uses an older method may be better. There isn't a lot of validity to say that, you know, Novavax is a traditional one. So to speak and therefore we can rely out it more. Some people heard the word novel when they heard about mRNA vaccination and they thought this somehow meant that it will be more unsafe or untested or something, even though it had been tested on a white group of people. So for some people who perhaps are anxious about using a new type of vaccine, this vaccine provides them alternative. Apart from that, the doctor says there's no scientific basis to choose one type of vaccine over the other and all vaccines currently approved in Canada are safe and effective. It's not necessarily the case that the mechanism of the vaccine tells you how efficacious the vaccine might be for the average person. For now, there isn't any specific reason why you might choose one for another. And when it comes to how effective Novavax will be against COVID-19 variants, the doctor says only time and real world data will tell. For more on this story, you can go to our website citynews.ca.

FDA flags risk of myocarditis in Novavax COVID vaccine,Yahoo Finance,2022-06-03,GsmkoloGeBM,"Welcome back and we want to head straight to the Wi-Fi Interactive where we are looking at the pharmaceutical industry today in Novavax, one of the worst performers on Wall Street and that is after an FDA warning on its COVID vaccines. And you can see, year to date, down 68 percent, Yahoo! Finances, Angelique Hemlani is here with the details. Anj. That's right, Jared. Of course, that coming as a result of the FDA out with their data analysis from Novavax's data that they submitted for the emergency use filing for that meeting coming up on June this summer, the advisory committee to the FDA is going to be weighing all this information and deciding whether or not to recommend Novavax's vaccine. We saw in that report today from the FDA saying, quote, multiple events of myocarditis, slash paracarditis, were reported in temporal relationship to the Novavax vaccine. And that is cause for raising concern for cause or relationship. So that is looking at something that we knew we heard of after those mRNA vaccines, Moderna and Pfizer both had similar relationships associated and that's something that really made Novavax a fan favorite among those looking to find less likely of having a side effect type vaccine. We had spoken to CEO Stanley Erk earlier on and he had specifically said that this was supposed to be a safer vaccine. Here's what he had to say. We don't have tens of millions of doses out there yet and so you don't have the opportunity to see what rare or infrequent events there are. We haven't seen any or much in our label, we'll reflect that. But we have a very standard protein-based vaccine that has so far proven safe. So as you can hear, saying that it's so far safe, we'll see more in the broader population, but there are concerns that we will see more cases of that Novavax in a statement saying quote based on our interpretation of all the clinical data. It is insufficient evidence to establish a cause or relationship, but they will continue to monitor those events. And of course, we have to also keep an eye on the calendar because the CDC now, as we talk about vaccines, the CDC has now finally given a date for those kids under five vaccines. We know that the FDA of advisory meeting is on June 15th and then a couple days later on the 17th and 18th is when we're getting to see the advisory committee for the CDC. So stay tuned. Yes, certainly. Many of us, particularly me, with kids under five years old, are very interested to see the outcome of that. But, Angela, you mentioned the CDC. They were all out with news today. But this time, they were talking about monkey pox cases in the U.S. more than doubling over the last week. Still, though, just at 20. So how worried should we be and what is the CDC telling us now about the outbreak? They are still saying that there is no reason for alarm necessarily. We do know now that there are 21 cases reported in 11 states. They have noted that the strain that they're looking at is mostly from the West African clade, which is not the most severe, though. It does obviously have some painful symptoms for those who are infected. We've still got FDA approved vaccines available more than enough supply, as well as approved treatments. They are saying, though, that while it is mostly identified in men right now, and especially males who have sex with males, we are noting that anyone can get monkey pox. So that's something that you have to keep an eye on. But there is a lot of focus on making sure that there's more communication about what to look for within the community and make sure that anyone who's a healthcare staffer can really ensure that they're scanning more for this so that we don't miss any of those cases. So we know that there are testing companies really racing to meet the demand, even though there isn't necessarily a stress on the testing system like we saw with COVID, but there is some concern that we might need some more testing available. Back to you."
How the Novavax vaccine differs from others,9NEWS,2022-06-09,StEyi8hNe50,"Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine. It's protein based and created in more of a traditional way using technology that differs from three vaccines already in use in the US. In general, the more we have the better. Novavax says two doses of its vaccine provides about 90 percent efficacy in protecting people 18 and over against COVID-19. However, the clinical trials were done before Omaquan became the dominant variant in the US. The most common adverse reactions included headache, nausea, or vomiting, injection, side pain, and fatigue. There's also some evidence of a rare swelling of the heart that's also been reported at times in people who got one of the other COVID-19 vaccines. This vaccine is made using small laboratory-built pieces of the coronavirus to stimulate immunity. I think there are still some holdouts that said, oh, the platform, the mRNA platform is too new. And Novavax is our older technology. Health officials hope that will make it more appealing to people who have concerns about the newer technology. Right now, about two-thirds of the population is fully vaccinated with at least their initial series. But less than a third have gotten a booster according to the CDC. If the FDA gives emergency use authorization, Novavax expects its first shipment to the US to be a few million doses. For health minute, I'm Andy Gayther."
How the Novavax COVID shot is different,FOX 5 Atlanta,2023-10-05,6ACJ46j3ouA,"the fight against COVID. The FDA has approved novovax's new shot, but this one is different from the established injections from Pfizer and Moderna. Fox Vice Christopher King joins us live and he spoke with an expert about how this new vaccine Christopher could help you stay out of the hospital. Yeah, Christine and Russ, the new technology or the new vaccine relies on technology similar to a flu shot or a childhood variant. There's a test that's a test that's not available to other people. It's a vaccination and expert we speak with says that should give families more options. I got the the latest COVID vaccine today Susan gully wants to make sure she's protected against COVID-19. This is like my fourth shot. The FDA on Tuesday approved a new shot from Novavax for people ages with an immune boosting chemical that's different from Pfizer or Moderna's mRNA shots already on the market. This is not messenger RNA. It's a protein subunit. Dr. Jane Morgan is the executive director of health and community education at Piedmont Health Care. She also heads Piedmont's COVID Task Force. Instead of stimulating the body to make this spike protein, if you will, it is actually injected whole and ready to go as a protein subunit. They are equally effective protection against COVID wings over time and health officials have already seen increases in late summer infections. Now you have a choice between whether you'd like to be vaccinated with one type of vaccine versus the other. Dr. Morgan says the Novavak shot gives you more weapons in the fight against COVID. On Novavak's Moderna and Pfizer, and I think the public should also have confidence in moving forward with all three of these vaccines. If there are some fence riders, then hopefully this brings you down from the fence. Again, that Novavak shot has approved for ages 12 and up. The Pfizer and Moderna shots approved for ages six months and up. Novavak says their new vaccination should come out in the coming days. Live in Midtown, Christopher King, Fox 5 News. Christopher, thanks so much."
Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine Q&A With Dr. Cindy Gay,UNC Health,2022-06-16,WRSStTnrtmw,"Music There are different ways to design a vaccine. The Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines use a strategy whereby in the vaccine they deliver an instruction or a code and that gets delivered into inside our cells and then our own cells are instructed to make a piece of the virus that elicits an immune response. With the Novavax vaccine, it's a protein-based vaccine which is a much more traditional vaccine. There are several vaccines that are proved and used in the United States for various infections and have been so for decades. With this strategy of a vaccine, the vaccine itself delivers the piece of the COVID-19 virus that we want to elicit the immune response to. It's the same spike protein that is eliciting a response with the other COVID-19 vaccines, but in this case it's been delivered directly in the vaccine. The results were really quite promising and released some time ago. The Novavax vaccine was 90.4 percent effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 illness. The data that's been submitted to the FDA is, covers a certain amount of time including when the Delta variant was circulating and much less so with the Omicron variant. In addition to the data we have from the Space 3 study, they have done additional analysis to test the vaccine against the Omicron variant in a lab for example and looking at immune responses and what's more important in neutralizing responses. There is some listening immune responses to the Omicron variant. It's less compared to the protection or the responses we saw with the initial Wuhan strain and the other variants. They also looked at responses after getting a booster dose which was provided through the Space 3 study and saw that the responses to the Omicron increased quite nicely. The UNC was a site for the Phase 3 study of the Novavax vaccine. It is a two-year study so our site like the others are continuing to follow their participants who enrolled for any safety issues and for additional immunological testing. In addition, the UNC was the site where we enrolled adolescents. So adolescents ages from age 12 to 17 who we are also continuing to follow on the study and will be followed for up to two years. In the United States, given where we are with vaccination rates, it's most likely that the Novavax vaccine, if approved for EUA, Novavax plans to submit for EUA approval to use as a booster. So in the United States it's more likely that the Novavax vaccine would be used as a booster dose. However, this EUA submission and approval would be for primary series. There are many of us that are hopeful that some individuals who remain unvaccinated given some concerns with what they see as newer vaccine strategies with mRNA vaccines would be willing to get a more traditional approach to vaccines. So for those who remain unvaccinated and are willing to try this vaccine, it would be great. The vaccine is already approved in several other countries including the European Union. It has been cleared by the World Health Organization. So it is being administered for primary series in many settings. One of the key advantages of the Novavax vaccine is that it does not have to be frozen. So storage and the logistics of delivering this vaccine in rural or in low resource countries would be much much easier. So in many ways it makes it a much more accessible vaccine once it becomes more widely available and including in the United States, which does have a lot of rural semi-rural settings where having the freezers that are needed and transportation of the vaccines is an issue.

FDA advisory group recommends Novavax Covid vaccine,CNBC Television,2022-06-07,8KffbrIuATg,"vaccine maker Nova Vax Meg Trial has it Meg. Hey Sarah, well FDA's group of outside advisors have just taken a vote to recommend Nova Vax's COVID-19 vaccine. The vote was 21 yeses, zero knows one abstentions, so really overwhelmingly in favor of recommending what would be the fourth COVID vaccine to enter the U.S. market for emergency use authorization. Of course, the FDA now takes the recommendation and will make its own decision potentially within the next few days or weeks. We will see what happens with that. But the argument here really has been an interesting one. This is a company that conducted the clinical trials was part of Operation Warp Speed. A lot of the data it was using to support the application were from last year before the Omicron variant even emerged. And the argument from a lot of the committee members is these data look very similar to the data we use to clear the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines initially. And if we're using the same standard, then it should be cleared. And there's a hope expressed even by the FDA that perhaps that this being a different vaccine technology will get the last few people who haven't yet gotten the vaccine potentially over the finish line with one they might be more comfortable with than one of the newer mRNA vaccines. Sarah, so the stock is still hot. It's not that. It doesn't open to backup. But Meg, how many years have we been talking to Stanley Ark that the CEO he's been on this show? He's been with you a bunch of times. They have been, they thought they were getting approval like two years ago. I guess the question now is, is, is there a market for this? Because the CEO of Moderna and Davos was saying they're throwing away vaccines at this point. Yeah, that is a very big question. You know, the CDC noted there are about 27 million Americans over the age of 18 who have not gotten their primary series in the US. We don't have good data on how many of those people might have been waiting for a more traditional vaccine technology and might consider getting this one. There is a huge amount of optimism that this is going to dramatically change that picture, but perhaps it could change a few people's minds. We'll have to see. Of course, this isn't even looking at it as a booster dose. We need more data on that for that to enter that part of the game. But it could potentially get it out there. At least as the first vaccine for Novavax, first product for this company in a long time working on it. Yeah, that's a milestone. For sure, Meg, thank you. Meg, Terence."
Novavax vaccine is different because it is a protein based vaccine: Physician,Yahoo Finance,2021-03-12,fqvdxpdjXJ4,"Let's take a look at chairs of Novavax. We are seeing that jumping in the session up nearly 7 percent. The drug maker published late-stage trial data that showed its COVID-19 vaccine was 96 percent effective against the original virus and 86 percent effective against the UK variant. Let's bring in Dr. Dan Baruch. He is the director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deakinis Medical Center. We've also got our very own Anjali Kamlani joining in on the conversation. Dr. Scretto, have you on today? Let's start with this vaccine though. We've already got three in the market here in the US. How is the Novavax vaccine different? And what does it mean ultimately if it does get FDA approval? Well, thank you. It's good to be here. This is welcome news and a very exciting news of another vaccine candidate. The Novavax vaccine is different from the the ones that are currently approved for emergency use in the United States in that the Novavax vaccine is a protein-based vaccine as opposed to the mRNA vaccines or vector-based vaccines of Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. So it's a new vaccine as well as a different class of vaccines. So it's a very welcome addition to the vaccine portfolio. And our hope is that it will be approved quickly. Dr. Anjali here, let's talk about how that stacks up. I've been talking to experts about how, you know, with that 96 percent efficacy against the original strain, it could potentially give it the banner of most efficacious in the world. But some are saying it's an apples to oranges comparison. When you're talking across the board, and this came up as well in discussions about the J&J vaccine, so lay it all out for us. It's very difficult to directly compare the numbers of one trial versus another trial, because all of these trials are done differently. They're done at different time frames during different states of the global surge, also in different geographic areas, and also some of the trials explicitly are testing for efficacy against the variants and the ones last fall, for example, were not. So it is known that probably all the vaccines will show a decrease in efficacy against particularly the B1351 variant in South Africa. And so looking forward, I know that the data is now out of the UK, and there's been discussion about whether or not the FDA is likely to use that in the emergency use authorization filing. We know that they did accept the global data for Johnson and Johnson's filing, but if the if Novak doesn't have a US data available, what's the likelihood that they'll accept this information? I can't say about the regulatory approval timeline. There is a large phase three study that's ongoing in the United States, and we expect that study will yield data shortly, perhaps next month. So whether the FDA will see the UK data as sufficient or whether they will want to wait for the US data is really a regulatory decision that I don't have an answer to at this point. Dr. I mean, we're talking a lot. We heard the president talking about what his timeline is as it keeps going. Just we're highlighting May 1st for all US adults to get in line to get vaccinated, but when you think about the number that we now have in the US, a lot of experts are saying that we should be getting rid of some of those to the rest of the world to kind of help in relief efforts there and how intertwined all of these recoveries are going to be. What's your take on maybe how it could look like we might be hoarding vaccines at this point? So first I'd like to say that the acceleration of the vaccine timeline is incredibly exciting with the approval of the J&J vaccine, the partnership with Merck, the acceleration of the vaccine rollout from Pfizer and Moderna, and potentially other vaccines may soon be approved in the US as well. So I think that the most important thing now is to accelerate the vaccine rollout and get everyone in our country vaccinated as quickly as possible as well as everyone in the world. Now the latter is a tall order and certainly if the United States has excess vaccines, which it looks like we probably will, then I believe that the plan is to donate those to help with a global vaccine effort. Also these manufacturers are manufacturing literally billions of doses of vaccines for the global for the global vaccine campaign. This is a global pandemic and it requires a global solution. Of course we have to vaccinate and protect everyone in our country, but we also have to realize that it is a global pandemic and if we don't take care of the global pandemic, then the continued pandemic anywhere in the world could threaten a resurgence of the pandemic everywhere in the world. So it really does require a global solution. Dr. Buruk, I know you worked with the J&J vaccine and I wonder about, you mentioned the partnership with Merck and the production of that. We know that the company is looking at a two-dose option of its vaccine and this partnership is largely going to affect supplies in the later part of the year. So I wonder on the conversation of its efficacy as a two-dose vaccine and then also the idea that whether or not we'll need that supply towards the end of the year. So for certain the world will need the increased supply towards the end of the year. Whether the United States will need that supply I think remains to be seen. It's good to have some redundancy in the system just in case any one manufacturer and it could happen to any of the companies whether any one manufacturer will hit some sort of hurdles or some sort of a stumbling blocks in probably what's the most aggressive vaccine manufacturing campaign in history. So it's good to have some redundancy in order to really meet the timelines set up by President Biden. But if all goes well then it's possible that there will be sufficient vaccine for everyone in the country by May."
Bay Area Doctor Weighs in on Novavax COVID-19 Shot,NBC Bay Area,2022-06-07,PdWyyjn2tmA,"COVID cases and hospitalizations were on the rise, but now it appears that the Bay Area has plateaued. Check out this line graph of the last three months in April. Cases started out low, but then they started to climb. Last month, we started seeing more cases and the beginning of a surge. But then take a look at the end of the line graph, where cases start to dip. Right now, our positivity rate for the state is just under 9 percent. And we could soon have a new option for a COVID vaccine. Some believe this one could be a key to reaching people who've been hesitant to get the other shots. And BC Bay Area's Elena Jones explains how this vaccine is different and what Bay Area doctors is saying about the benefits and the risks involved. Anytime you increase immunity in a population, it's better for all of us. As the Bay Area starts to level off and it's latest COVID surge, there's a new vaccine up for debate that doctors hope could help reduce the next spike. What I'm hoping for is that NovaVax being a more traditional vaccine. Anyone who's been hesitant to take the vaccine will be more comfortable taking this one. Dr Monica Gandhi, infectious disease expert at UCSF explains, NovaVax, a protein-based vaccine doesn't use mRNA or DNA that's been a source of concern for some who've avoided vaccination. Instead, this uses a combination of spike proteins and immune boosting ingredients that fight off coronavirus. She believes the benefits go beyond the initial vaccine. When you mix vaccines, we get a broader response. And so I can see this is a booster for older people and vulnerable populations this winter. The newest vaccine could be cleared in a matter of days with the Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee unanimously voting today to recommend going forward with approval. Similar to vaccines already on the market, it comes with some risks. Gandhi says young men could see the same type of minor heart inflammation after their second dose, but at a much lower rate. If you extend the dosing interval between doses to eight weeks, mild carditis and that mild risk is even lower. A vaccine variety, Gandhi hopes, will convince more to roll up their sleeve.

Death from COVID-19 isn't more likely for vaccinated people,VERIFY,2022-11-30,Epfi5QWzqrY,"The CDC estimates more than a million people have died from COVID-19 in America, and thousands more are still dying every month. We recently got several questions from viewers asking about claims that the virus has actually become deadlier to vaccinated people than to those who have not gotten the COVID vaccine. So is that true? Are you more likely to die from COVID-19 if you're vaccinated? We used these sources to verify. The claims originate from reports that said in the month of August, 58 percent of people who died from COVID were vaccinated. That would make it the first month ever, where the majority of deaths were amongst vaccinated people. That's true, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of CDC data. But just because the total number was higher doesn't mean the rate of deaths was. Even though vaccinated people made up 58 percent of the deaths in August, they made up just over 67 percent of the population. So vaccinated people aren't more likely to die than the unvaccinated. They're just way more of them in general. The most recent CDC data showed that unvaccinated people died from COVID at more than five times the rate of those who got their initial shots and nearly 19 times the rate of those who also got the updated booster. So we can verify, no, you're not more likely to die from COVID-19 if you're vaccinated. COVID is still disproportionately killing the unvaccinated. With your fast fact, I'm Casey Decker."
Nearly all U.S. COVID deaths are unvaccinated people,CBS News,2021-06-25,esFzR6zTX74,"And you're studying report finds nearly all COVID-19 deaths happening right now in the US are among unvaccinated people. The Associated Press analyzed the latest CDC numbers and found that of the 18,000 virus-related deaths reported last month, only 150 of them included fully vaccinated folks. For more on this, let's bring in Dr. Bob Lehita. He's the director of the Institute for Autoimmune and Rammatic Diseases at St. Joseph Health. So Dr. Bob right now just over 45 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated. If everyone got their shot, what could we see where could we see daily COVID deaths drop to? Oh, Vlad, we could see daily COVID deaths drop to almost zero if people would increase their vaccinations. And this is what's tragic about the story is that every death that occurs now is totally preventable. You know, there are less than 300 deaths per day. And every, or I would say 99 percent of the people who die right now are unvaccinated. And this is really a very tragic thing when you think of the family's relatives and all losing someone. And when the death could have been totally prevented, Vlad. Let me ask you about this. Apparently there's a new and slightly changed version of the COVID variant first identified in India, what's known as the Delta variant. Now this new one is called Delta Plus. What can you tell us about it and how concerned are you about the slightest mutation? Well, I'm particularly concerned about this latest mutation and Marie because number one, it is a variation of the Delta variant. It increased transmission has been the case for the Delta variant, this Indian variant. The second thing that is unbelievably, it's hard to put my hands around it is that it doesn't respond well to the monoclonal antibody, which we've been using to prevent further deaths. And the worst thing about it is it attacks the lungs. I call it a new, a new mo, new mo tropic virus. It prefers the lungs, which you know the regular coronavirus or the COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on people's lungs. But it I call that a neuro tropic virus because it liked to infect the brain. It was about a thousand times more likely to affect the brain. This Delta variant, that's the Delta Plus, prefers the lung. It's about a thousand times more lethal to people's lungs and the lungs filled with fluid and the micro-emboli and respiratory failure ensues. So it's a real, it's a real issue for us right now. Dr. Bob, a CDC advisory board said earlier this week that annual booster shots might be needed for the elderly or transplant recipients. What about the general population? Yeah, that's a, that's a big one of lad because here the vulnerable people should probably get a yearly shot. By those who are vulnerable, besides the transplant, patients and those who are immunosuppressed, there are those with chronic heart conditions, with bad, bad diabetes, they should probably get an annual shot. This is what the WHO is saying. What they're also saying is that the general population, the healthy population, the young people, all those above 12 who are below, say the age of 70 should get their shot every two years. So that's very important. But again, it's still under study and the data are not out. And I might even say that if we looked at cellular immunity, we're only looking at humoral or antibody immunity. If we looked at cellular immunity, we could maybe carry that out to three or four years for a booster for those of us who are normal and unaffected by comorbidities. Researchers at Oxford University say that they have come up with a way to predict how effective a vaccine might be using a blood test. Can you explain how that works? Yeah, that's, that's basic. And it really involves, again, the measurement of something we called humoral immunity, which is neutralizing antibody. Specifically, they look at anti spike proteins. Remember the spike is the thing on the virus that is, that is pushed to the surface of your cells and makes your immune system wary and knows that you're infected. So they're looking at that anti spike protein and anti receptor proteins. These are things they're looking at in those who have been vaccinated and those who have not going out of the phase three trials. We are essentially doing the same thing here in many ways and that is looking at those people who were in the late phase three studies and seeing which of them get infected and which of them do not because we know who was on placebo and who was who actually got the vaccine. So right now they've developed a blood test looking at serology, which means the serum antibodies, the neutralizing antibodies. But no one has looked at the more complex cellular immunity, which again could be a great blood test if we could, if we could miniaturize it, make it easier to look at. So clinical trials for the Nova Vax vaccine showed it is 90 percent effective against the virus and most variants. It's also cheaper to make and it's easier to store Dr Bob. So why hasn't there been a push to start using this in the US? Yeah, this vaccine is very interesting. This is another two dose vaccine, but this offers you greater than the 90 percent protection against the variants. We're not so sure about the Delta Plus variant that I spoke about a minute ago, but it does show that it is very protective. However, here's the kicker. There have been three vaccines developed and they got, they got early emergency use authorization and we have an abundance of those vaccines in the marketplace right now. There were three vaccines that are pending full FDA approval. So I think in the US they're saying, why do we need another vaccine? Even though this vaccine is a lot easier to take, it's very, very effective and it's based on the subunit injection, which means you know hepatitis B. That's a subunit protein that we get injected into us for immunity and also hooping cough. That's a subunit vaccine. And so these vaccines, the whole theory behind this that is if Novavax early on had paired with a company say like Merck. And you know, remember the company BioNTech paired with Pfizer and then there was a there was Moderna, which paired with another large pharmaceutical company, but Novavax didn't do that. They were about ready to do their their face, three's back in mid 2020, but it didn't happen. And so consequently they are behind the ball as it were and the Novavax vaccine. I don't think we're going to see for some time because we have right now an abundance of vaccines, those two M RNA vaccines and that J and J vaccine, which is a one shot deal. However, I think the Novavax vaccine is really effective, even though it's a two dose protein subunit vaccine. All right, Dr. Bob LaHita, thank you so much. Thanks, Anne Marie, thanks, Vlad."
"While breakthrough deaths increase, vastly more COVID deaths occur in unvaccinated in TN",WSMV 4 Nashville,2021-09-17,Mwn054nmV84,"While new data tonight shows unvaccinated Tennessee and are overwhelmingly dying from COVID compared to those who are vaccinated but news for investigators also found the number of vaccinated people has risen to a troubling number. Our Chief Investigative reporter Jeremy Finley found a way you could we can relate to all of these numbers. Public Health experts put it this way you have two choices to get you home tonight. You can drive this car known for its safety features or you can drive this one that doesn't have any safety features. Either way you're going to get hit by a bad driver swerving all over the road. Which car do you want to be in? Now apply that comparison to getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The car with no safety features in this case they're unvaccinated so far 13,647 unvaccinated deaths compared to those choosing the car with the safety features. 232 have died who were vaccinated those are your odds. When I look at that data I see a success and I also see a failure because in public health you don't want a single person to die. But you probably notice something that safer car 232 deaths break through cases. That's a lot of cases. You're going to have people that will see this and say there are more than 210 who are vaccinated who have died so why should I take the vaccine? If there are more numbers in the unvaccinated lane I don't want to be there no matter what I understand about medicine or health care I want to be over there where more people are surviving. And here in Nashville the difference is even greater. 1332 COVID deaths in unvaccinated people only 13 deaths from COVID have been invaccinated people something to think about the next time you get behind the wheel. Jeremy Finley news for Investigates. A lot to think about great perspective there Jeremy if you'd like to look at the data for yourself we've got it right now on the news for app and of course as we learn new information on COVID booster shots vaccines and everything in between we're going to post it there and on our website."
"US reports more than 800,000 total Covid-19 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data",CNN,2021-12-14,uH35uw7Ira4,"Well, there's a grim new milestone to report tonight, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 800,000 people in the United States have died of COVID since the start of the pandemic. Also tonight, new CDC data shows the Omicron variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant and is being detected at a rate of about 3 percent around the country right now. Here in New York, Cornell University is shut down its campus after more than 900 COVID cases among students this week. According to university officials, a quote, very high percentage of those cases are Omicron variant cases in fully vaccinated individuals. There is good news about Pfizer's anti-viral COVID-19 pill, according to the company's final analysis. They say it is nearly 90 percent effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients. I want to say I talk about it all, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, and a former member of the Biden Transition Team COVID Advisory Board. Professor Osterholm, I appreciate being with us. So, this outbreak at Cornell, what does that tell you? I mean, 900 new infections, university shut down, I mean, more if not all fully vaccinated individuals. What does that say? Well, frankly, it's a harbinger of things to come. This is a highly infectious virus. As we see it move around the world and become established, even at a few percent, we're starting to see in more and more really large outbreaks developing. And so I think that we are watching a war right now between the Delta variant and the Omicron variant, as to who's going to become the king of the viral hill. And I think right now, Omicron's transmission potential means that it probably will win. So, you know, professional sports leagues are highly vaccinated, highly tested. The NFL, the NHL are seeing rise in infections, a league-sourced selling scene end that 28 players tested positive today after 37 did yesterday. I mean, what does a rise in cases among proathletes tell you about what might be going on in the general population and people who aren't regularly being tested? Well, you have to realize, again, we have a different categories of people who are vaccinated. Those unvaccinated, of course, which we realize are continuing to drive a large part of the serious illness with the Delta situation. But we're also beginning to see more and more people who have not been boosted, meaning that there are six or more months out from their original first two doses of the mRNA vaccines. Right now, only about 30 percent of the country has actually been boosted, of those that could be. Many of the athletes we're seeing right now are actually in that category. And that's why, as you heard yesterday, the NFL, in fact, put in place mandatory vaccination for teams, not the players, but everyone else on the teams because of that very issue. So this is why we've talked over and over again about why boosters are so important. That's what's going to continue to drive this situation. So what do you expect of this winter to be like in the U.S.? You know, Anderson, every morning when I get up, I try to scrape the five inches of mud off my crystal ball and be able to predict that. And, you know, so far we've done a pretty good job of predicting where this would be. I think the battle between Omicron and Delta is going to be a key one. If, in fact, Omicron is not as severe, and I know many people don't want to hear that because they're afraid that that'll give people complacency. But I think the data were so far shows that it's not as severe. But if you have it offset by many, many more people getting infected than we even would with Delta, then you might still have the same impact on the healthcare system. And right now, we're watching Delta explode in this country, particularly in the east and the southern states right now are starting to see some increase. And so I think that if Delta wins out, then in fact, we're going to see a major increase in severe illness. If Omicron wins out, we may see an increase in severe illness. And we just don't know yet. You know, obviously, look, a lot of people listening right now at home are probably just kind of despairing because it just seems like we're going backwards. There's one step forward, and then we go backwards. Does this just go on and on like this for years? I mean, I, you know, some people had suggested, well, ultimately the virus will kind of weaken, and it's the ability to spread will weaken. And that's when, you know, and more people will be vaccinated, and that's when we sort of emerge into a new normal. Well, one of the challenges we have right now is we don't really understand what it takes to be immune as a human. We know that the vaccines we have are remarkable tools, but we're also realizing they may only provide limited long-term protection. And so until we can get potentially, a better understanding of that, the question will come up, well, we need new boosters in six months from now. We don't know. And we just have to be honest with the public and say that. This is a time where science is learning by the day and then trying to translate by the night to the public. And so it's very clear we aren't a confusing situation. I don't think it goes on like this forever, but for the misimmediate period, it's not clear what's going to happen over the next few months. We can say no matter what happens though, you're going to be better off if you're fully vaccinated first times and get your booster dose. You'll be better off. And what do you make of Pfizer's new pill to treat COVID? I think it could be a real game changer. I think it's a very important development. My concern is exactly what I've said for the last year while in vaccines. You know, I've been saying, there's the last mile in the last inch. The last mile is getting the vaccines to the people, the last inch is getting the needle in the arm. We've seen that 40 percent of the U.S. population won't take that needle. We're already hearing feedback from the street that some people are saying, well, that back that new drug is just part of the Biden administration of a Biden poison pill. We're going to stick with our eye of a mechthen and I get the drug. These will be the same people that have not yet been vaccinated. If that happens, we will waste an incredibly, incredibly important tool in reducing severe illness. And so time will have to tell on that."

AP: Nearly all recent COVID deaths in US among unvaccinated,We Are Iowa Local 5 News,2021-06-25,IVGpZAbeQ7Q,"tonight new information about COVID-19 deaths and those who aren't vaccinated and an analysis by the Associated Press showing nearly all COVID deaths in the US are now in people who didn't have a vaccine shot. It is a staggering example of how effective the vaccine has been. Local 5's, Jackie Schmilling reports. The Associated Press taking a look at available government data from May showing breakthrough infections and fully vaccinated people accounted for fewer than 1,200 of more than 853,000 COVID hospitalizations. So that's less than 1 percent. The overall trend emerging from the data echoes what many health care experts are seeing around the country. The CDC director saying the COVID vaccine is so effective that nearly every death due to COVID-19 at this point is preventable. Death's plummeting so far in the US from a peak of more than 3,400 a day in mid-January. So just another reminder, get your vaccine. Nearly everywhere in Iowa doesn't require you to get an appointment before you go. Jackie Schmilling, Local 5 News. We are Iowa."
Unvaccinated COVID deaths,ABC4 Utah,2021-09-14,78PjB7NINVM,"comes as new data from the CDC showing people who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 are 11 times more likely to die or 10 times more likely to become hospitalized with the virus. It was for Haley Hendrix looking into this data here in Utah for us. She joins us now live in Salt Lake City with more on what she found. Haley. Well, Glenn, local doctors tell me the CDC's data reflects hospitalizations and death rates here in Utah. But now the virus seems to be impacting younger populations compared to last year. Data from the Utah Department of Health shows throughout the pandemic coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths are highest in Utah's older than 65. With vaccination rates now greater than 80 percent for seniors, doctors say the age of those hospitalized and died from the virus is getting younger. And that's why we are seeing fewer of them in the hospital or in the ICU. And why where you have lower vaccination rates among younger folks, they're being admitted when they're at vaccinated. COVID-19 has claimed the lives of more than 2700 Utah's. 719 of those people were 25 to 64. Of the family members saying, I wish I had convinced my wife or husband or my loved ones to get vaccinated. And I wish I can turn the clock back. Nationally, the CDC predicts by October up to 18,000 more people could die from the virus. Data shows the needle continues to move here in Utah and doctors hope those who have not yet received the shot will reconsider. Nearly nine months later, and the world has administered hundreds of millions of these now very effective, very safe vaccines. Looking at what happened with our older age groups, once they got vaccinated, the rate of hospitalization and mortality is much lower. Well, doctors say, well, vaccination prevents the majority of contract of people from contracting severe COVID. They say antibody treatments are also helping some who are at high risk of developing severe complications. We're putting live in Salt Lake City, Hayley Hendrix, say, busy for news. Thank you, Hayley."
"U.S. reports over 2,100 coronavirus deaths in one day with vaccine on horizon",CBS News,2020-11-25,2N8MSxAorQI,"More than 2,100 COVID-19 deaths were reported in the United States on Tuesday, making it the deadliest day the country has seen in six months. The virus continues to hit hard in America's heartland. Record numbers of COVID-19 deaths have been reported in at least nine states, including Maine, Wisconsin, Missouri, and North Dakota. Data shows that the Dakotas currently lead the world in COVID-19 deaths per capita. This all comes as millions prepared to travel and gather for Thanksgiving. Our David Begno leads our coverage from Fargo, North Dakota. Did you know that right now the Dakotas, both North and South, lead the world when it comes to the number of people dying on a daily basis per capita? Now that's a fact. But there will be people who listen to that and say it's fear-mongering, it's fake news, or they'll just look the other way. That is the reality in this part of America, both of the Dakotas. I talked to a well-known radio host. He's a Democrat in a richly red area, and I asked him, how do you think North Dakota is handling the pandemic? If you were grading it, it would be an F, probably an F minus. It's that bad. Joel Height Camp hosts the number one talk radio program in North Dakota. The former Democratic State Senator takes tons of calls about COVID every day and a largely Republican state. And you have a right to call into this show anytime you want. Well, the high to hypocrisy in North Dakota right now is how we care for our elderly. If you go into Costco, you go into Walmart, you go into any of these places, they say, put your blank mask on. You're going to put it on. But you know what? They're not willing to do that around Grandpa and Grandma after they've been out in the bar. And I can't figure it out. Just yesterday, North Dakota reported 37 new COVID-related deaths. That is a new high. They have the second highest mortality rate in the world, and some of their hospitals are overwhelmed. That's why the U.S. Air Force has sent 60 nurses to help staff hospitals around the state. In South Dakota, the debate over wearing a mask continues. Statewide. I think if we choose to wear it for our own protection, that's on us. But to force us to wear it, you know, like I'm just, I'm against that. Around 50 percent of South Dakota's say they do not wear a mask. Shelby Krabbenhoff, CEO of Sanford Health, the largest health system in the Dakotas, suddenly retired last night after creating a firestorm this week by saying he wasn't going to wear his mask at work because he had recovered from the coronavirus and was immune. Now in a statement, his own health system said they had mutually agreed to part ways and that his views didn't reflect those of the company. He also downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic to our Sioux Falls CBS affiliate, Kelo Land. It's hard for me to say we are at a crisis. That would be misleading from a clinical standpoint. He is not a doctor, but his chief medical officer, Alison Suttle, is, I asked her, would you classify what is happening here in the Dakotas as a crisis? I would. 36 hours after she contradicted her CEO on CBS this morning, he is gone. Dr. Suttle is also calling on South Dakota's Republican governor, Kristi Nome, to mandate masks statewide. But the governor refuses to. North Dakota's Republican governor, Doug Burgham, did that two weeks ago. How much is Trump's messaging affecting local politics here in North Dakota? It affects everything here in North Dakota. If he tells a lot of these folks that the science doesn't back it up or that you can shove a light bulb up your keystone, it's all going to make things better, some people here are going to believe it. We hear that loud and clear and please don't shove anything up your keystone to protect yourself from COVID. It's not going to work. One more story before we go, Yankton, South Dakota, small town in the southern part of the state, they met the commission did, the elected officials met to decide whether or not to implement a mask mandate. They decided against it and the local newspaper said they wanted more time to educate folks. Here is a sincere question. How much more time do you need to educate people that masks matter? We're eight months out of the pandemic, 225,000 people plus have died. How much more time do you need? Glad to hear Marie back to you. It's a great question, David. Let's get into it with immunotherapy researcher and Dr. Leo Nassola, he is joining me now to talk about this. So, Dr., we could be getting closer to a coronavirus vaccine with some promising results from Pfizer and others yesterday. The CDC director, Dr. Robert Redfield says, he sees the first vaccine dose as being rolled out the second week of December. Now, Monsef Slatwy, who leads the vaccine development for operation warp speed, was asked about the timeline on CBS this morning. I want to play a bit of what he said and we'll talk about it. He should be, I hope, close to an approval first of the Pfizer vaccine that has shown 95 percent efficacy. We'll be reviewed by the FDA on December 10th and maybe on the 11th or the 12th approved. Within 24 hours from approval, we plan to distribute the vaccine. In the case of the Pfizer vaccine, Pfizer themselves will be shipping the vaccine doses to the exact location that each state will have identified as the areas where they want the vaccine doses. And doses will be proportionately to the population distributed for each state. So, Dr., we're potentially just weeks away from a vaccine. Who would be eligible to receive the first doses? Hi, Vlad, good morning and thank you for having me. I think overall this is really good news. I think we are all ready for a vaccine and when the FDA approved the emergency authorization for it, things would start to feel a little different. So vaccine distribution has been discussed widely and I think it's very difficult to say who should get the first doses of vaccine without seeing the results from those vaccine studies. You see, we need to know what the vaccine safety profile is when it comes down to the vulnerable population. So postulating that this vaccine is safe and effective in the elderly, most likely, folks that are living in nursing homes and healthcare workers should be able to receive the vaccine first. All right. So, I guess the question that is sort of on my mind, Dr., is we keep talking about the great and wonderful news of these vaccines. But that to me still seems kind of far away because Thanksgiving is tomorrow and Christmas is in a few weeks and people are behaving as you heard in that piece from our correspondent David Begno as if either the vaccine is already here or that they still need to wait for the information. We know the information, the CDC and doctors ranging from Dr. Deborah Birx to Dr. Anthony Fauci to Dr. Robert Redfield, they all say that the mask, wearing a mask is probably the best thing you could do. It probably is even better than the vaccine because it protects those around you. So why are people still not getting that message? Well, I completely agree with you and Decorate COVID-19 Statistics in the United States are shocking. The United States are seeing more cases of coronavirus than ever before. And if 1,000 deaths a day won't make you wear a mask, I honestly don't know what would. We have flattened the infection curve before and we could do it again by collectively practicing how we know to slow the spread of this virus that is wearing a mask, wearing hands, avoiding gatherings and indoors. But some parts of the population are not doing that. So I think we're running out of options to convince the public because we have limited our stamina for it. Let me ask you about side effects. The doctors who met with the CDC advisor said this week that the pharmaceutical company should be transparent about any potential side effects. People may experience after getting the first dose. Pfizer and Moderna have both acknowledged that their vaccines could have or do some side effects. I mean, if the side effects aren't life threatening, should that matter to people? Well, in clinical studies, especially in vaccine clinical trials, there is extensive clinical data review and usually there is a standard review process to look closely at the safety data. And that includes understanding potential side effects. We have yet to see those papers and we have yet to see the published data. But so far, I'm not concerned. I think transparency is essential in times like this, especially when some are trying to politicize science. But the good news is that vaccine developers have committed to be completely transparent and to make the data available for scientists and they will follow the standard safety review processes. Let's talk about kids. The state of Tennessee says once a COVID vaccine becomes available, it will be optional in K to 12 schools. Should kids get vaccinated and are these vaccines safe for children? So we don't know that yet. Again, the data from those trials have not been published. But let's be clear, we need robust national vaccination campaigns. I think mandates and tactics to compel vaccinations in more in chooseive ways like limiting access to services or jobs are tricky. Anytime that society is very polarized, I'm not sure how mandates would play out. And I think this is a time for us to bring people together and continue the messaging that vaccines save lives and everyone should get around on the same tent. That's a good message. The CDC is also considering new guidance to reduce quarantine time if someone was possibly exposed to the coronavirus. So this is sort of interesting. And I know that there are people because we've politicized this pandemic so much, not we, but our politicians have politicized this pandemic, that there will be some people that will say, yes, see, you didn't need to quarantine or isolate in the days and the number of days that was previously stated by our medical professionals. But Dr., just before we get into this question, remind our viewers again that there is still so much that we don't know about this virus. There's still so much that we're learning you as a medical professional are learning every single day. So now the question, why would the agency consider shortening the advised quarantine time to between seven and 10 days as opposed to 14 days? Well, you're completely right. There is no shortage of unknowns when it comes to COVID. But at this time, it makes sense to see the CDC evaluating the applicants to shorten the quarantine timeline. I think the best majority of people getting infected in the first three to five days in the practicality of a 14 day quarantine during the winter is it's very difficult for some people to comply in it, I think, as we're headed into a more difficult season, shortening the quarantine time makes sense. Yeah, I mean, I just have to go back to what I said earlier. I mean, a lot of what the medical community, the CDC, is asking of Americans is to be cognizant of those around you. That's really what this is all about, right? It's not about how you feel or how the virus has affected you. If you are, you know, sadly, tragically unlucky enough to be infected with coronavirus, but you don't show any symptoms and you get through it without any problems, that's great. And in 10 days, you feel fine, you feel like you're ready to get back to work. That's wonderful. But what about the people around you who may not be, who may be more vulnerable to the virus and who are not going to be blessed with, you know, the fact that you were able to get through it without any issues. What sort of what I keep thinking about? That's right. And I think it's a collective effort. But here's what we are missing. We need to allow COVID testing at home without a doctor's order. This is not the time for us to be gatekeeping tests from people. Folks at home should be allowed to get those tests over the counter. We can stop outbreaks if we understand where they are. And I think if you test positive for COVID, there is no wanting the right, right? That will get out of the house. So I think the FDA should update the guidance on testing and let people by COVID tests over the counter. All right. Dr. Neal LaSolla, we appreciate it. As always, have a wonderful Thanksgiving. Thanks for being with us. Thank you. Stay safe. You're too. Happy Thanksgiving."
More vaccinated people are getting hospitalized with COVID-19. But unvaccinated still make up the ma,FOX43 News,2021-10-11,OCX7EnzjPH4,"Thank you for joining us. I'm Rachel Young Kunis. The number of vaccinated people who are ending up in the hospital with COVID-19 is on the rise. Fox 43 Jamie Bittner is in Derri Township Dolphin County with what people should know as booster shots begin to roll out. All right, there goes a Pfizer. Yep. For many city in these chairs at Hershey Pharmacy. This is COVID shot number three. We're seeing a lot of Pfizer booster doses in those boosters are now becoming an even bigger deal as new data from Pennsylvania's department of health shows the number of vaccinated people getting COVID-19 is going up with a highly contagious Delta variant. Vaccinated people now account for 26 percent of COVID related hospitalizations over the past month. So we're seeing a fair amount of breakthrough case with Pfizer out of the three COVID-19 shots you could get only one is approved for a booster so far. That's Pfizer, but this month discussions are expected to begin again to approve one from Aderna and Johnson and Johnson too. It does give you a high level of protection. You know, certainly nothing is 100 percent but it's much, much better protection than not being vaccinated. Pennsylvania's acting physician stress is any shot is better than no shot. She points out unvaccinated people still make up for 74 percent of the past months, nearly 5,000 hospitalizations. And she says they are among the sickest. So the vaccination is going to keep you exactly what it's supposed to keep you from becoming seriously ill. What health officials don't know yet is how long vaccine efficacy lasts after the initial shot and who was most impacted. That's data the state is still studying. Since a lot more people are vaccinated, we see more cases in vaccinated individuals as expected, but the great news is the vaccines are still working and working very well.

"New study shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce risk of severe illness, death l GMA",Good Morning America,2022-01-07,XaDaHsMsil0,"the fight against COVID with cases surging nationwide. Some good news right now from the CDC about vaccine protection. A new study of a million fully vaccinated adults shows that severe illness is extremely rare less than a fraction of a percent. Our chief national correspondent, Matt Gutman is there in Burbank, California with the latest. Good morning, Matt. Hey, good morning, Cecilia. We have long known that vaccines are highly effective, but this new study lends hard numbers to that understanding. Basically, if you are vaccinated, you are more likely to be struck by lightning than to die of COVID. This morning that new data showing how effective COVID vaccines have been. A new study of more than a million vaccinated adults done pre-omacron should less than a fraction of a percent suffered severe COVID-related symptoms and an even smaller fraction of a percent died. Those who did become severely ill or die were primarily older adults, immunosuppressed or those living with multiple underlying medical conditions. We are seeing more and more sick patients come into the hospital that aren't vaccinated. In Michigan, the state's largest healthcare system saying it will now have to limit elective care. Beaumont Health calling Omacron one of the most contagious viruses we have seen in our lifetime, adding that more than 400 hospital employees are now out with COVID symptoms. We do all of the roles. We'll push the stretcher, we'll clean the floor, we'll hold a hand of a patient. And when you start to become truly understaffed where you can't even open an area because it's not safe, there's not enough people to monitor. It starts to get a little bit scary. And here in Los Angeles, more than 800 police and fire personnel are out with COVID, the city defending staff levels, despite rising ambulance response times. California officials also facing questions about the Super Bowl. I'm in the surgeon cases, Mayor Eric Garcetti saying he is certain the big game can be held at LA Sofie Stadium. Confident that will happen here and it will be able to have a great Super Bowl celebration. But the NFL is preparing for backup as it normally does, reaching out to other venues like the AT&T Stadium in Dallas. The NFL telling ABC News, we have contacted several clubs to inquire about stadium availability. In the event, we cannot play the Super Bowl as scheduled due to weather-related issues or unforeseen circumstances. And we're now seeing this national push to recalibrate how the nation thinks about COVID with six of President Biden's former advisors now calling on the President to adopt an entirely new pandemic strategy, one that focuses on the new normal of living with the virus rather than trying to wipe it out.

"COVID-19: Excess deaths 'too high', says Independent Sage member",Sky News,2022-03-22,7xvDHvHXA6A,"Joining me now, Professor Christina Pagel, who's Professor of Operational Research at University College London and a Member of the Independence Age Committee. And so what do you think is the key thing that we've learnt from these figures this morning? I mean, to me what really stands out is obviously 133,000 excess deaths is a lot of people who died who, without the pandemic, likely wouldn't have died. But we've actually had, if we look at COVID on the death certificate, almost 190,000 deaths over that time period. And what we have seen in the last years is we haven't had a flu season. And actually in that sense excess deaths is kind of, you're kind of seeing more deaths from COVID, but far fewer deaths from flu and pneumonia than we would normally see. And so it's kind of a weird measure to use in that way. It's kind of giving you a very big picture without really kind of digging into the details. And we're seeing, as your correspondent said, the kind of the death from how people have reacted to lockdown, about not being able to access care, potentially more deaths from heart disease and diabetes. But in terms of those 190,000 excess deaths from COVID on the death certificate, I mean, if you were to balance that up against the number of deaths that we didn't have through things like flu and things like that, what would be the difference do you think? Well, we normally have some of it between 10 and 20,000 deaths a year from flu or pneumonia. And we just haven't seen that over the last few years. And it's not that they're dying from COVID instead. It's that the measures we took to control COVID also controlled flu and the manias and other respiratory diseases because people just weren't mixing as much. And so if you don't mix, you don't get sick from all kinds of things and you also don't get exposed to things like car accidents and that kind of thing. So we've seen fewer deaths because of the things we were doing to control COVID. But of course, if you would say, put that as your biggest estimate as 20,000 and say there's 20,000 lives that have been saved, quite potentially because we were doing that, that's still 170,000 deaths, isn't it? It's still an awful, a large number of cases. There's nothing good about that number, nothing good at all. And I hope that, especially as we move into thinking about the COVID inquiry that we don't forget, the enormous toll that COVID has taken on our population and not just the people who died, but the families that are left behind, I think they're estimates that maybe about between nine and 12,000 children have lost a close family member. I mean, that's a really big impact on people. Absolutely. Hospital admissions though, you say that they are the best way to compare the different waves and where we are now. I mean, when you look at the numbers now anecdotally, it seems that so many of us know somebody who has COVID at the moment. We seem to be in another wave, but that's not reflecting through in hospital admissions, is it? Well, hospital admissions are going up. They've all made, they've almost doubled since the beginning of March. Scotland today has more people than hospital with COVID than they've had throughout the whole pandemic. Now, some of those will be people who aren't there because they have COVID, they're there for other reasons and just happen to have COVID. But we're still seeing increases in people who need hospital for COVID and we're also in a situation where our most vulnerable people be elderly and now, you know, almost six months out of their booster and we know that the booster is a waning. And so, OMS last week said that, you know, almost 4 percent of over 70s have COVID right now and so that will create more pressure on hospitals. Hospitals are still seeing the longest weights for any that they've had. We're still seeing more people, more NHS staff off sick because of COVID. And so in a situation where the NHS is actually really squeezed and we are seeing an increased pressure from people with COVID, even though on an individual level, you're less likely to see hospitals all the anywhere a year ago. So, how do you feel about the fact that all of the restrictions have been lifted? Do you wish that we'd still had a certain number of them in place and that perhaps, you know, everybody seems to have flung their masks in the bin now, don't they? Well, I haven't. But it feels very odd to me because, you know, we saw in December, we had a really massive spike when Omicron first came here and people did change their behaviours, people were testing more people, reduced their contacts. We also had plan B measures, so masks and working from home January in cases did come down. But they're now going up again, they're going up again really fast. And it's quite likely that we're going to get to at least the same peak that we were in in December, if not higher, like it already is in Scotland. And it feels like no one kind of even knows let alone is doing anything about it. I mean, the chances of someone getting COVID now are pretty high. And it just makes me think, you know, it's been less than three months since the last wave. And, you know, it's this our future that people are going to get sick every two, three months. And that's going to have a big burden on the economy as people can't work and some people will get long COVID and some people will need hospital and die. And I kind of feel like we do need to talk about what it means when we keep having these waves of new variants coming through. But what is the solution? I mean, people don't obviously like wearing masks or isolating and keeping their distance or working from home. But it seems unfeasible that people will continue to take over to precautions forever. I do think that there is a discussion to be had about work. I know, obviously, not everybody can work from home. Many people can't. But I think for people who can, there is now a need to hybrid working where you spend some days in the office and some days at home. I think that the really long term thing we have to do is think about ventilation and fresh air because the one thing that we have learned is that if you're outside, you're a much, much lower risk of catching COVID. So if we can make the indoor environments more like outside, then we will reduce transmission. And there's no doubt about that, right? And we know how to do that, but it requires a will and it's not something we can do as individuals. It's something that requires the state to support businesses and public services to improve indoor air quality. OK, Professor Christina Pagel, good to talk to you. Thanks so much for giving us your thoughts on these figures."
"Novavax CEO on Covid Vaccine Approval, Omicron Efficacy",Bloomberg Television,2021-12-21,LOatcCnNESA,"Congratulations on the approval. What we really want to know, Stan, is how the NOBA BAC vaccine is going to fit into the existing program. In that, it seems like availability of vaccines not the problem. It's vaccine hesitancy. How do you fit into it? Well, thanks. Thanks for having me on. There are a few features that we can talk about. One is after generating a great deal of efficacy and safety data over the past year for protein-based vaccine, we also have great stability data, which means that we can get our vaccine out globally without freezing. We can get it to store in normal refrigerated temperatures. It can be at room temperature for some period of time. And that's going to be very helpful to get it into all parts of the world. That's probably point number one. Point number two is that we've shown that the vaccine boosts very effectively. There's going to be a lot of boosting going on, particularly with Omicron. And we think our vaccine is primed for that. And so those are some of the advantages that we've got. Also, there's vaccine hesitancy. And for people who are more comfortable with a more traditional protein-based vaccine, that will hopefully expand the population of people that get vaccinated. Stan, can we just dig a little deeper? It's guy, congratulations on the news. I think we've all been waiting for this for a very long time. So very happy to see it finally happen. You talk about the mix and match. I've had two Astra and one Pfizer. Could I have a Nova Vax after that? Sure, that's the data that we're generating. Both of it that we have generated through studies that have been sponsored in the UK. And we've just recently started a new trial in the US to show precisely the mix and match, the ability to mix and match. For the traditional vaccines, like a J&J, the US FDA recommended the mRNAs over the traditional vaccines. What kind of data do you have if we take kind of the Pfizer and Moderna and then you got the J&J? Where do you fit within that in terms of your efficacy? Well, in terms of efficacy, I think we've generated probably the best efficacy of anybody. We did it at a time when the variants, alpha and beta variants were just emerging. And we showed that our vaccine had very effective 90 percent effect on efficacy. And so we're quite comfortable with that efficacy profile. Stan, can I come back to these two of logistics, but actually the kind of the fundamental logistics of this? Given the well-worn path we now see for some of the other vaccines in terms of getting them to market, getting them into people's arms, how does it actually work getting a new vaccine into the process? Just logistically of trucks and containers and doctor surgeries and hospitals, how does it actually happen? And how quickly does that part of the equation kind of start to work? Well, this is a well-worn pathway. We've been vaccinating the world's children for decades when with a refrigerated pathway. And we've partnered with a company called Serum Institute, which is the largest vaccine distributor in the world. And they vaccinate, I think, somewhere around two-thirds of the world's kids get vaccinated every year with their distribution system. So in the low-end-middle income parts of the world, we've got a partner or Serum Institute that can get our vaccine out using just the traditional pathway. And of course, that's even more so in the high income countries. Stan, we were just showing a chart of UK cases. Obviously, the dominant strain now, Omokron, in the US, the UK, et cetera. Were you able to test against Omokron? Do you have an idea of when you might get that kind of data or if you need to sort of update the vaccine to be able to hit individual variants? Well, we're doing two things. One is we're checking, we're evaluating the Serum from people who have already been vaccinated and looking at the Omokron responses, the antibody responses to Omokron. We'll have those data within days. And so our expectation, based upon what we saw with alpha, beta, and delta, is that we'll have a robust, protective level of antibodies with Omokron just as we have with the others. And in addition, we're making a new variant, an Omokron-strained variant, in the data from all these, from the trials that we're doing now, the evaluations we're doing now, will guide us into whether we should be adding a new variant strain or sticking with what we have. And all those data will come out fairly soon. And we'll work with the World Health agencies to determine the pathway forward for the variant strain. Stan, when are we going to get approval in the United States? What's the timeline there? And do you need... Well, how critical is it that you get that approval? Because I'm really curious, if I'm vaccinated with your shot here in the UK, and I want to travel to the United States, is that going to be a problem? And do you think you're going to get full uptake until you see a kind of greater swath of countries that don't have approved the shot? No, I think we will get quite a bit of uptake. Both as a booster and as I mentioned, there's still 40 percent of the population that's not been vaccinated yet. And we'll try to chip away at that in an aggressive fashion. So I think you asked about approvals. We've actually filed globally with about eight or nine different agencies. And I think last week, we announced that the World Health Organization has approved us, which gets us a pathway into all of the developed countries of the world, and the developing countries in the world. And we filed, we could just got European approval, we looked for the UK, Australia. We were filing with the US of final package within the next few days. And then that'll just go through the regulatory approval process. So we think that while this is a global problem and our vaccine now has been, we've actually been shipping the vaccine to Indonesia, which is where we got our first approval. We shipped about five million doses there. And we'll continue to ship there. But the US, of course, is an important market for us as well. We learned today that the double dose of AstraZeneca vaccine only has about three months until you need a booster. Do you have a sense from the NOVAX vaccine and sort of how long immunity is going to last and when we need a booster? I mean, now we're already starting to hear rumors about the fourth booster, or the second booster fourth shot. Right. So we, those data take time to develop. We do have some data showing that we have an effective response that lasts out two, six months and beyond. And so we'll just, we'll get more data and find out. We do know that boosting gets us a very strong immune response back above the levels after the second dose. And so again, those data are being generated over time. What I expect is that we're going to be seeing COVID vaccination on some regular basis. And so what we're doing at NOVAVACs is we started a trial last year where we've actually combined our flu vaccine with a COVID vaccine. And we'll have data on that coming up and then by the end of the next quarter and show that, that maybe the best way to do this is to have an annual seasonal respiratory vaccine, which would involve COVID and flu."
How the Novavax COVID shot is different | FOX 5 News,FOX 5 Atlanta,2023-10-05,Y7vDbIIkKzo,"the fight against COVID. The FDA has approved novovax's new shot, but this one is different from the established injections from Pfizer and Moderna. Fox Vice Christopher King joins us live and he spoke with an expert about how this new vaccine Christopher could help you stay out of the hospital. Yeah, Christine and Russ, the new technology or the new vaccine relies on technology similar to a flu shot or a childhood completely different from the other vaccines. And that's an explanation. An expert we speak with says that should give families more options. I got the code. The latest code of vaccine today Susan Gully wants to make sure she's protected against COVID-19. This is like my fourth shot. The FDA on Tuesday approved a new shot from novovax for people ages 12 and up. I'm willing to try it. that's different from Pfizer or Moderna's mRNA shots already on the market. This is not messenger RNA. It's a protein subunit. Dr. Jane Morgan is the executive director of health and community education at Piedmont Health Care. She also heads Piedmont's COVID Task Force. Instead of stimulating the body to make this spike protein, if you will, it is actually injected whole and ready to go as a protein subunit. They are equally effective protection against COVID wanes over time. And health officials have already seen increases in late summer infections. Now you have a choice between whether you'd like to be vaccinated with one type of vaccine versus the other. Dr. Morgan says the Novavak shot gives you more weapons in the fight against COVID. Novavaks, Moderna and Pfizer. And I think the public should also have confidence in moving forward with all three of these vaccines. If there are some fence riders, then hopefully this brings you down from the fence. Again, that Novavak shot has approved for ages 12 and up. The Pfizer and Moderna shots approved for ages six months and up. Novavak says their new vaccination should come out in the coming days. Live in Midtown, Christopher King. Fox five me. Christopher, thanks so much."
Local Doctor Discusses Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine,KPIX | CBS NEWS BAY AREA,2022-02-07,O31CdTU92FE,"Joining us now to talk about some of the latest COVID-19 headlines, Dr. Anlu, with Stanford Health Care. Dr. Thanks for joining us. Thanks so much for having me on. So Novavag filed a request for emergency use authorization of its COVID-19 vaccines. This one protein-based. So how does that technology work? How is it different from the mRNA vaccines? So the Novavag vaccine is called a protein subunit vaccine. It is essentially a little piece of the virus. It's the spike protein, in fact. And it takes longer to manufacture than mRNA vaccines, and so is taken longer to get to where it is now. But it shows your body a little piece of the virus that can't replicate, it can't cause an actual infection. But it's enough of the virus that of the spike protein that it stimulates your immune system to form a memory response. And so it also comes along with what we call adjuvants, which are things that are added to tell your immune system that this is something to pay attention to. This is something to form a memory response to so that your body just doesn't think, oh, this is nothing I need to worry about. And so that way, and so you might have some side effects, you know, your arm might be sore, you know, as your body is mounting this immune response to form a memory so that the next time it sees the spike protein possibly on an actual virus, that it knows to attack it and get rid of it. So it is different from the mRNA vaccines because the mRNA vaccines essentially provide like an instruction pamphlet for your immune system, sorry, for your muscle cells to make spike protein briefly. This is not something that sticks around long at all. And your muscle cells get this little instruction manual to make spike protein that, you know, disappears after a little bit, but just enough that your immune system gets a chance to take a look at this spike protein and form a memory response against it. None of them contain any live virus. You can't get an actual infection from any of the currently FDA authorized vaccines. So, you know, that, so if you have symptoms afterwards, it's not because of an actual infection, but it's from your immune system forming its adaptive response and it's appropriate. So do you think, just a quick follow-up, do you think this is the way we're going to be going in terms of vaccines? If it's more effective? So we don't know yet if it's more effective comparatively. So more, you know, there's data to look at difference is in the antibody levels, but that doesn't translate necessarily into directly into vaccine efficacy. So, so more to follow on that, it does look like it is a very effective vaccine from what we've seen so far after two doses that are three weeks apart, but especially after a third dose that is several months later. So more to follow on that, it does have the advantage of being pretty spable at refrigerator temperatures, and so it doesn't need to be frozen the way mRNA vaccines do, which should make distribution and in the logistical part of getting it into people's arms much easier. I think it's going to be a good option for people who can't get an mRNA vaccine for whenever reason, or are hesitant about getting the NMRS vector vaccine, which is the Janssen or Johnson and Johnson vaccine. Yeah, that's a big plus. All right, some public health medical professionals recently wrote an op-ed that pushing for an N to all COVID restrictions in schools, what's your feeling on that? I have heard from some folks at UCSF that that does not represent many of the people at UCSF in terms of wanting to relax restrictions to that degree, where I think that they call for dropping a lot of pretty much all restrictions. And whether or not I agree with it is another matter, but I can tell you about the concerns that I've heard from families, from patients, families of children who have speech and language development issues might feel that the benefits of removing masks outweighs the risks of COVID. But we have a lot of patients, adults and kids who have immune system problems. And I think that they're pretty terrified of the possibility that people will take masks off indoors. So we really do need to balance all of these different priorities. I personally think that indoor masking is still safe, but outdoor transmission is really uncommon. And so we should try to prioritize being outdoors, getting people together, we're not staying at home anymore, getting together and having our masks off outdoors to accept that we can, but also maintaining some masking indoors. All right, I want to ask you about this because Governor Newsom recently talked about releasing an endemic plan sometimes soon. Your thoughts on being closer to an endemic stage, at least regionally, maybe? You know, the endemic state is really reached when there is a pretty stable, predictable, and hopefully manageable level of infection. It doesn't mean that there's so many cases that the virus is just everywhere. That's not what endemic means. I do not think that we're at an endemic stage, although case rates are declining, they're still really quite high even in the Bay Area. And although many people have now had Omicron, the return of some infection prevention measures has probably contributed significantly to the reduction in cases. And so I don't think that we are at the point where we can declare victory yet. So even of an endemic kind. You know, the next new variant maybe around the corner. And we don't know that our vaccines will continue to work against those new variants. So, you know, to be determined, I think that we can be cautiously optimistic as cases come down and adjust the degree of infection prevention measures according to how much virus there is in the community. Okay, so I think people do hope we do get to this endemic stage, as you say, and we know the threat isn't gone. But so how do we then live with the virus? Mass can still be a thing at least for some, maybe from now on or as the cases have been flow. You know, I hesitate to make any predictions. It has so much to do with how many cases there are. What the next variants will be like, whether there will be more severe or less severe, and will they be blocked by the vaccinations to some degree. And also what therapies that become available for people who do get sick and how good they are and how available they are. So, you know, I think that there are reasons for optimism. We're in a really much better position than we were in spring of 2020 or spring of 2021. So, hopefully, this spring will bring more togetherness and more time together and hopefully getting to a point where we have a good sense of how to control this in higher situations and with high risk populations. And I guess we have to look at the situation now and say, well, yes, Omicron, it does spread more rapidly, but because of the vaccination rates and other factors, people aren't getting as sick. So, but we don't know that as what you're saying about maybe the next variant or the one after that. Right. And, you know, something to keep in mind is that the Omicron variant is overall less severe, but that's, you know, putting together people who are vaccinated and people who are unvaccinated. And so, in people who are vaccinated, it is substantially less severe. In people who are unvaccinated, it's somewhat less severe. And, you know, and I think we've all know people who have had Omicron, who had no symptoms, who had really mild symptoms, which is hopefully the majority of people who are vaccinated. But, you know, we also know people who are fully vaccinated, boosted and still got really pretty sick. So, and then people who have immune system issues who are substantial segment of our population may not produce any response to the vaccination and even a fully boosted remain at risk. So, you know, we have, we still have a lot to do and, but we have a lot more tools at our disposal now. We do. We're grateful for that. And we're grateful for your time, Dr. Anlu with Stanford Health. Thanks so much. My pleasure. Have a great day. All right, you too."
Novavax: Late-stage trial of potential COVID-19 vaccine begins in UK,Sky News,2020-09-25,CWk8vzZoYN0,"Early trials of the Nova Vax vaccine in Australia show it triggers antibody levels that are even higher than those in patients recovering from COVID-19. But it now faces a much bigger test, a study in 10,000 volunteers in the UK with the first doses given within days. The immune responses look very promising indeed and that's why we need to get to this point where we can actually see whether in fact that translates into protection against disease, which is after all what this is all about. The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is also in phase three trials in the UK, but other prototypes are likely to be tested here as well as the second wave of the epidemic takes off. Volunteers will be drawn from the vaccine research registry, which now has a quarter of a million members of the public signed up. It is an unfortunate silver lining of increased infection is that it is good for clinical trials because it does mean that the participants in the trials are more likely to get exposed to virus. So that means that we are would be quicker to be able to demonstrate a relative protection of those people who have been vaccinated. The UK has now bought vaccines from six companies, including Glaxo Smith Klein, where the chief scientist, Sir Patrick Valance, was previously president. It's reported he has a deferred chair bonus worth around £600,000, but the government says he's not involved in procurement decisions. The vaccines, though, will be judged on results. This expert warns one shouldn't expect too much from the first generation of jabs. A vaccine that would reduce the severity of symptoms is, you know, would have a use and in the absence of, you know, a wide range of available effective therapies. Then that has its role to play. But ultimately, the reason why we have vaccines is just, is to stop transmission. The pandemic death toll is expected to pass one million within the next week. A vaccine is urgently needed and with 10 now in late stage trials around the world, there is at least hope. Thomas Morse, Gynese,"
New Novavax vaccine is “highly effective” against UK Covid variant - BBC News,BBC News,2021-01-28,S_puNrn4e3w,"There's more good news tonight for the UK's vaccination programme. A fourth vaccine could be approved shortly after major trials in the UK showed it was particularly effective against the UK variant. Nova Vax is an American jab, but it's being produced here in the UK in a factory on T-side. Tonight, the Prime Minister thanked all the volunteers involved in the trials and said, if approved by the UK's medicine regulator, the UK has 60 million doses on order. The news came amid a deepening rower between AstraZeneca and the European Union over vaccine shortages. Our medical editor, Fergus Falls reports. Once again, science has triumphed in the fight against coronavirus. The US firm NovaVax has released results of its British trial showing the first proven efficacy against the new more contagious UK variant. There were more than 15,000 volunteers on the trial throughout the UK. Over half the cases of COVID recorded were the result of the new variant. The result showed the vaccine was 95 percent effective against the original COVID strain and over 85 percent effective against the new UK variant, giving an overall efficacy of 89 percent. The former head of the UK vaccine task force said that in a separate trial in South Africa, the vaccine had showed it protected against the variant of concern there. It's a fantastic result because it shows that the NovaVax vaccine is effective against both the UK variant as well as the South African variant and has shown phenomenal efficacy and it's made in T-Sides. Not only have we trialed the vaccine to show that it's safe and effective, but we're also making it too. So we'll be able to save lives in the UK. Meanwhile, the biggest immunisation drive in the history of the NHS just keeps growing. This supermarket pharmacy near Birmingham started offering COVID jabs today to the over 75s, one of more than 1400 vaccination sites in England alone. What a contrast in Madrid where supplies of vaccine have all but dried up, the Spanish capital has cancelled all appointments for around two weeks. The EU was slow off the mark in ordering vaccine and now wants some of the UK supply of AstraZeneca doses. In May, the UK government was the first to sign a deal with AstraZeneca for a hundred million doses of its COVID vaccine. It wasn't until August three months later that the European Union signed an agreement for up to 400 million doses. Last month, the UK's MHRA became the first regulator in the world to approve the Oxford AstraZeneca Jab. Tomorrow, the European Medsense Agency is meeting and is expected to approve the vaccine, but for the moment, it remains unlicensed in the EU. The AstraZeneca vaccine is grown in bioreactors. I've seen how complex the processes at this site in Oxford. By contrast, there have been poor yields at the main European site in Belgium. The EU is threatening legal action to force AstraZeneca to hand over some doses made here. We can and will get doses of the vaccine from the series of plants which are mentioned in the in the contract and therefore also including those in the United Kingdom. And there's another twist. Germany's Vaccine Committee has said the AstraZeneca Jab should for now not be given to people aged 65 and above. It cited insufficient evidence in how effective it is in older people. The government here firmly rejects that. Our own authorities have made it very clear that they think the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is very good and efficacious. They think that it is effective across all age groups and provides a good immune response across all age groups. There is limited evidence on how well the AstraZeneca vaccine works in the over 65s, but leading scientists here say they're confident it will give strong protection. Thank you. And Fergus joins me now. So more good news. Another vaccine potentially, Novavax, how significant could that prove to be? Huge Sophie. Now this is already in the hands of the medical regulator, the MHRA, began what they call a rolling review of the data from these UK trials of the Novavax vaccine earlier this month. And if and we, they have to prove that it's safe and effective, if they approve it, then it'll be produced here. And it will put rocket boosters under the UK vaccine program, which is already outstripping most of Europe. So it's brilliant news. And the fact that it's effective, highly effective against the UK variant and less so effective, but still effective against the South Africa one. Fantastic news. You're talking just now about the AstraZeneca jab in Germany. They're advising it not to be given to the over 65. Should people here be worried? People who've had it? Well, there's no concerns about safety. In fact, there were fewer side effects in older people who received the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine in the trials. This is about effectiveness. Now there isn't much effectiveness data from the trials, but what the medical regulator and the scientists at Oxford and those who advised the government all said was the immune responses of the elderly were so strong and so similar to younger adults that the vaccine should be effective. We'll get more data on that soon. And there may be a bit of vaccine nationalism here from the Germans. They've bought up extra supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine developed in Germany and they will use that for those age 65 and over. Fergus Walsh, thank you. Well, France, Portugal and Germany are just some of the EU member states struggling to get hold of enough vaccine supplies. Vaccinations are having to be postponed before the rollout has really begun. Germany's health minister says the country's facing a shortage well into April and warned of at least 10 tough weeks ahead. Jenny Hill reports on the difficulties Germany is facing. A waiting room without any patients. A vaccination centre without any vaccine. Germany relied on the EU to place its orders, a decision which may have come at a cost. We really feel it here. People keep asking us why we haven't been vaccinated yet. At the end of the day these are political decisions which I have to accept, but I am looking forward to the time when we have enough vaccine and can get on with it. So, we're going through the city of Mauritius. Notorious now for city guide Terezia. Immunity would bring life back to marble streets, restart the German economy, but just 2 percent of the population have had their first dose of the vaccine so far. I think it's very good. Even so, she tells us it was right for the EU to order vaccine together. If everyone in Germany gets vaccinated but not people in the countries around it, and the plague comes back over the border, if we do it we should do it together, even if we have to wait. Months of restrictions here appear to be paying off. Germany's infection rates are now falling, but there's real concern about the impact of new variants like those discovered in Britain or South Africa. And while the German government has pledged to offer every citizen of vaccination by the end of the summer, that's starting to look like a very hard promise to keep. So far, Germany's relied on the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine. The manufacturer has announced delays. There were new production sites here in Marburgs expected to boost output. Supplies too are expected from Moderna, and if approved and on time AstraZeneca, though Germany may only give it to the under 65s. We want to know what took so long. We want to know which member states were rather reluctant in ordering together and which member states said, hey, let's go forward. I think it would have been a great sign from Germany as the economically strongest member state to say, hey, if it's a question of money, we'll just lay, let's say, 10 billion euro on the table to get things going. Marburg's vaccination centre closed now that they expect supplies to arrive next week. No one's quite sure what happens after that. And even the German government won today, the next 10 weeks will be tough. Jenny Hill, BBC News, Marburg."
Novavax says vaccine is effective against COVID-19,Associated Press,2021-06-14,2lQ4j3ULe0c,"What we're announcing today is the unblinding data from our Phase III efficacy trial in the U.S. The results were quite good. They showed profound efficacy and safety profile. And it matched what we did in the UK Phase III earlier this year. The major takeaways from the study are that we had overall we had 90 percent efficacy which is very high particularly at a time when there are many variants circulating, in fact mostly variant circulating during the trial. And it turns out we had no moderate and no severe cases of COVID in our vaccine trial. I think you know we need more vaccines. Just a fraction of the world's population has been vaccinated. We need vaccines to go globally particularly in low and middle income countries and our vaccine is uniquely suited for that because it's stable at refrigerated normal refrigerator temperatures and that will help. We expect to file in several regulatory authorities including the United States and the EU and the UK and India by the end of the third quarter. I think the importance of the study not only is that that we got very good efficacy and safety profile but that it matches what we've done before in a large Phase III trial in the UK and so it shows that the consistent efficacy and safety of our vaccine."
Novavax: How does it work and how is it made?,CBS 8 San Diego,2021-06-18,_d9aN4C3Nnw,"Tonight, the latest on a new COVID vaccine, you could have the option of taking soon. The newest COVID vaccine made by NovaVax works in a different way from the ones already approved for use here in the U.S. News 8's Marcellole shows us the science behind it. This could soon be the fourth COVID vaccine option here in the U.S. It's easy to store and transport, and the way the NovaVax vaccine works is tried and true. NovaVax is developing what's called a protein subunit vaccine for use against the coronavirus. It uses harmless copies of the coronavirus spike protein grown in insect cells. They're actually using moss. The proteins are then extracted and assembled together into virus-like nanoparticles. Scientists mix an immune-boosting compound called an adjuvant into the vaccine. The shots prime the immune system to recognize the spike protein if the real virus ever comes along. There are protein-based vaccines against other diseases, like HPV and hepatitis B, so it's not as novel a technology as some of its vaccine competitors. NovaVax plans to seek authorization for its vaccine in several countries by the end of September. And that includes here in the U.S. The maker of NovaVax says large studies in the U.S. and Mexico show the vaccine is about 90 percent effective against the disease and protects people against variants, although the Delta variant first identified in India and causing big concern right now wasn't around during those trials, so we'll have to wait and see how effective it is against that variant."
Novavax approved in EU as fifth vaccine effective against COVID-19 | DW News,DW News,2021-12-20,10ieSiDI0dA,"We begin with late developments. The European Union's medicine's regulator has approved a new coronavirus vaccine made by U.S. biotech company Novavax. It's the fifth jab to be given approval for use within the EU for people aged over 18. While the regulators said trial data showed the Novavax jab had no serious side effects, it requires two doses, three weeks apart. It's shown high effectiveness against older coronavirus variants, but it's unclear how it will perform against Omicron. Novavax uses a more traditional protein-based technology, raising hopes that it can convince people who are hesitant about taking newer mRNA vaccines. I'd like to bring in now Dr. Deepte Gurdassani, an epidemiologist at Queen Mary University in London. Dr. Thank you so much for your time. Five vaccines are now approved in Europe. What does this latest Novavax shot bring to the table that the others are not? I think it brings another vaccine, which is always a good thing, given the supply shelter, which is that we have across multiple countries. It's also a vaccine that doesn't require a sort of cold storage that the mRNA vaccines do. So it's potentially a vaccine that can be used much more widely across lower middle income countries where cold chains may not be required in the same way that they're required with mRNA vaccines. Having said that, of course, we don't know what the effectiveness is against Omicron and whether boosting is required in the same way as with other vaccines and when. So I think those are questions that now need to be urgently answered as we understand its value overall in terms of global vaccine equity. Isn't what we need right now, a vaccine that is specifically targeting Omicron? So I don't think that in itself is sufficient. I mean, the thing is we've had about a new variant every three to six months and unless we are able to slow down the evolution of the virus by containing transmission, it's very, very likely that we'll be faced with a new variant in another six months or so. So what we need is multi-valent vaccines that hit multiple variants as well as other measures to slow down transmission so that we can actually slow down the rate of evolution the virus so we're not faced with a new variant every time we develop another vaccine against a previous variant. So do you then envision your situation where we'll have to get vaccinated more often every couple of months whenever a new variant, well, manifests itself? I think that's very likely and I don't think that's something novel. I mean, we need to remember that you know, we get vaccinated for flu with whatever strain of flu is circulating every single year. So I don't think that in itself, you know, is massively problematic. But I do think that given it takes a six-month period or so to approve a new vaccine and test it out, we do need to still slow the spread of the virus. Boosters will help even boosters against previous variant because they provide very, very high levels of immunity, which can override that sort of escape that we are seeing even with Omicron. So getting boosters is vitally important, but it's also important to take other measures alongside to reduce transmission so that the virus is not constantly ahead of vaccine development. And talk to us a little bit. What is the most important metric right now? I mean, we're talking about Omicron being very contagious and spreads very easily. Should we be paying attention to the number of infections or the number of hospitalizations? What do you look at? So I think the rate of spread is going to be the most important determining factor for impact. When you have a variant that's spreading or doubling every two days, that's faster than any variant we've seen so far. It doesn't matter in some ways how severe it is because the impact will mostly be determined by the number of people infected. So even if a variant is less severe, that just buys you a few days, given cases are doubling every two days. So, you know, given Omicron is spreading very, very rapidly, it has very, very high potential for population impact and overwhelming healthcare services. So we need to really act early because we're on that sort of curve of exponential spread and we're already seeing what's happening the UK and Denmark and we need to preem that in other parts of Europe. And Dr. Afine will thought from you, of course, a lot of people are hoping to see loved ones during this festive season. What's your message for those people, for those people? I think my message would be we're in a crisis. I think there's a real possibility that many people across Europe will not have emergency care available to them in January, the way things are headed. And the Omicron variant will spread in other parts of Europe as it has in Denmark and the UK and will see similar crisis. So if you can, just hunker down for Christmas and you can have social contact with people later on because this is sort of an unprecedented crisis. Most of us can't even say what the predicted entire impact is going to be, but it's not worth taking the risk. Dr. Deep Tejert, Guru Dhasani, epidemiologist at the Queen Merit University in London. Dr. Thank you so much for answering our questions."
Novavax is the first Protein-Based Covid-19 Vaccine,KPRC 2 Click2Houston,2022-11-11,s9Bm9Tn4jA8,"The first protein-based COVID vaccine booster is now available for use in the U.S. for adults, joining us to discuss this newly available option is the company's chief communications officer and executive vice president, Sylvia Taylor. Sylvia, thanks for making time for us this morning. Thank you so much for having me. Good morning. Absolutely. Important information to get out there. What is the significance of these recent authorizations from the FDA? So I'm here this morning representing NOBA Vax, where a company that has developed and launched a vaccine against COVID-19 that is now authorized in the United States. What's significant about this news is that our vaccine is now authorized for primary vaccination for adolescents 12 years of age and older. And in adults 18 years of age and older, our vaccine is authorized for primary vaccination and importantly, as a first booster. Wow. And you mentioned adolescents there, can this vaccine be used in teenagers? Absolutely, it can. As a mother of two teenage boys myself, I have a lot of confidence when I know that I can make a choice in picking the right vaccine for my kids. The NOBA Vax COVID-19 vaccine, Monovalent, has been authorized by the U.S. FDA for adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. What I think is important for people to know is that our vaccine is different. It is a protein-based adjuvanted vaccine. That's the same technology platform that has been used for decades in other vaccines that adolescents and adults may have commonly received, such as influenza and against hepatitis B. So we think that choice is empowering and can give parents the confidence that the NOBA Vax vaccine may be an appropriate choice for their adolescents. Yeah, and you're still with the available options are already available. Why do you think vaccine choice is so important? So right now we're in this unprecedented time of COVID apathy and I think people are just really tired of it, but at the same time we're heading into the winter, the temperatures are dropping and the holiday season is upon us. Our research shows that having choice is empowering for people and motivating them, especially when it comes to making the decision to get vaccinated against COVID-19. That vaccination is still the best tool that we have to prevent COVID-19 serious illness, hospitalization, and even death. But we're finding some concerning statistics right now in adults 18 years of age and older who've already received their primary vaccination series less than half of them have are up to date with their vaccination and less than half of them have received their first booster. So we think it's really important that people have choice because we think having choice will motivate people to get vaccinated. And so before we go here, is there a website folks can check out for more information? Yes, absolutely. We think that people should talk to their doctors, talk to their pharmacists, and go to vaccines.gov to find out if they can find the Novavax Monovailant vaccine in their area. It's very simple. They just enter their zip code and they find places where they can get themselves and their loved ones vaccinated. Perfect. All right, Sylvia Taylor, Vice President Chief Communications Officer for Novavax, thank you for your time and all the information."
"COVID-19 vaccines: FDA gives Moderna's vaccine full approval, Novavax seeks authorization",Yahoo Finance,2022-01-31,npdYTCTbUYA,"Welcome back. On the COVID front, hospitalizations are finally ticking down in the right direction as Omicron infections eb and the FDA finally granted Moderna's COVID vaccine spike vex full approval. And that's after a year following the first emergency use authorization and that was greenlit about a year ago. And for all of this and more, we want to bring in other finances, Anjali became Lonnie and Anj, why don't you just give up a wrap up, give us a wrap up of what you've seen and all the developments over the weekend. Sure, Jared. Well, as you know, we are continuing to see Omicron still affect parts of the country while we are seeing nationally the averages come down. We are still watching those deaths. And there are some experts who believe that because of the sub variant of Omicron, we might actually see just a little bit elongated surge from what was initially expected. And for all of that, of course, we know that vaccinations are playing a key role to that point. Moderna getting their full approval from the FDA today. They can now market their vaccine spike vex as well as help ease any sort of issues that might come from shipping overseas for a vaccine with emergency use authorization versus full approval. Meanwhile, we also know Nova Vax submitted for its first emergency use authorization in the US today. Meanwhile, we know that it has, of course, gotten some authorizations globally, but adding the US to that has really opened the door for some who have really been waiting for this right now. So no word on what the process, how long the process will take after this, but that's where things stand right now. Back to you. All right, appreciate that report. Anjali Kimlani."
"Novavax CEO discusses Covid vaccine, which was cleared for use in the EU",CNBC Television,2021-12-20,DKcuMzdqIaY,"The European Commission granting authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine. The EU Drug Regulator saying the vaccine has 90 percent efficacy, but those trials were done when the alpha and beta variants were circulating. The company does expect to submit its data to the USDA by the end of this year. Joining us now in a first on CNBC interview is Novavaxio. Stanley, or Stanley, congratulations on the milestone today. I'm coming in that and that's really my question, which is, why did it take so long? You've been out with this data for a long time. Well, it's taking time because it's taking us time to get the manufacturing scaled up in all the processes and analytics in place that you have to do as a biologics company. And we started two years ago in this process or a year and a half ago in this process with basically zero capacity and we've been out with this data for a long time. So, in a way, this has been a great day for us. It's globally the regulatory process is coming together on Friday. I think we announced the WHO and giving us emergency use listing and today with Europe coming in. I think that's just great. We're looking for more to come. That is the question on manufacturing and I know that has been a big hold up for you. What are the significant amounts of doses for these countries that are now starting to approve your vaccine? And what do the numbers look like? Well, we can. And that's why we've gotten these authorizations and listings is because they've been pouring over all of our data that we've been sending to them. And we're at the scale now and then in the first quarter, we'll be at scale where we can produce over two billion doses in 2022 on a global basis. And that's why we're looking for more to come. Obviously, I already have multiple billions of doses globally of other vaccines already administered. Where do you see yours fitting into to this mix? We obviously know the performance inside effect profiles. All those things already in the market. Can yours be used potentially as a booster to others? Or how does it? How do you see it placing among the others? I think the answer is yes to the other ones. We're using it as a booster to people who've gotten other doses in the past year or so. Well, a couple unique features. One is that our product is very stable. And so we can ship our product at refrigerator temperatures, stored at room temperatures for some number of hours. And so the product is very stable. So we can get it across the globe much more easily than you can with other vaccines. We've gotten good booster data. We have good data on efficacy and safety. And so we're looking forward to getting the vaccine out to many places. A lot of different uses for the vaccine right now. Any data stand on the vaccines efficacy against delta and Omicron, which are the current worries? We do. We've, in fact, so we had our we did our phase three efficacy trials. Unlike other folks we did it when there were booster, when there were variants in the marketplace, alpha and beta. And we showed that our vaccine worked very well against those. We also have data against delta showing that we have very broad, broadly neutralizing antibody responses to the delta variant. And I expect within the next very short period of time that will have data against the Omicron that we'll be able to talk about shortly. Stan, is this business going to be fully reactive from here? I just wonder if there's a way for a company like yours on a research basis to be proactive in trying to handicap where things move next in terms of variants or just general patient need? Well, that's a great question. And of course we are. We've actually now made the variant. And we're going to be testing it in animals and very shortly. And we'll get it up in humans. So we're starting to make it in such a way that we can scale up the process. And we're starting to make it in such a way that we can scale up the process. It's not going to take very long to do that because the process we expect is going to be the same as we're already using. So there's no changes to the manufacturing sites to get to get variants made. Well, we don't know. And we'll start to know soon. What we don't know is whether we actually need to make a strain change to the vaccine like we do with flu every year or whether we can use the what's known as the Wuhan strain. And that will depend on the data that I mentioned to you just a little while ago. The data that shows how what kind of broadly neutralizing antibodies we have against Omicron. But we're also being proactive not only with Omicron, but we have a flu vaccine that we are in clinical trials with with the combination flu and COVID. And so those are the types of things that we can do to anticipate future strain changes or variants that come about in either flu or COVID."
Novavax hopeful its protein-based COVID shot will persuade the vaccine hesitant,WUSA9,2022-02-07,aADLXPDjtiI,"after nearly two years, Novavax filed for emergency use authorization with the FDA last week. If approved, we would be the fourth vaccine to be made available for the American population. The Gatheursberg based company says their shot gives the unvaccinated a new option. It's a two dose vaccine given three weeks apart. The big difference Moderna and Pfizer are mRNA vaccines. Novavax is based on a protein subunit, a technology that has been used to protect people for decades, often resulting in fewer side effects. Our vaccine technology is built on the same platform as other vaccines that people are commonly getting such as HPV and shingles. So we think the fact that it's a tried and true technology platform could get some of the vaccine hesitant people to get their vaccinations. 64 percent of people in the US are fully vaccinated. If approved, only those 18 and up would be eligible for the new shot. And while most of that population has had at least one dose, the company says they hope to change the minds of those who have been holding out. There is still the need for people to get vaccinated. No one is safe until everybody is safe. So that means it's really important for the population to get their initial series and then their booster. And we think that our vaccine can be an important option to make people feel confident and more comfortable in getting their vaccination."
Novavax Conducting COVID-19 Vaccine Trials,CBS Pittsburgh,2021-07-12,R4RhaEYdb7s,"As the Delta variant continues to spread, the biotech company Nova Vax is now conducting vaccine trials on children and teenagers as young as 12. The trials are underway at locations around the country, including a doctor's office in Pleasant Hills. That's the only place in Pennsylvania that's taking part. And now only on KDK News at 630, Amy Watt has found out how this shot might actually encourage those who are vaccine hesitant to finally roll up their sleeves. This teen year old Sierra Brown says she wants to make a difference. Mostly just to help so that other people can feel safe and so that I feel safe about it. The Brownsville teen is one of 12 volunteers at the preferred primary care physicians location in Pleasant Hills. They're among 22 hundred children nationwide, participating in the Nova Vax COVID-19 vaccine trials for 12 to 17 year olds. We need trials and we need stuff like this in order to be able to for it to be available to everyone. And when Sierra's mom heard more specifics about Nova Vax, she felt even better about letting her participate. Just knowing that this was a little bit more comparable to some of the vaccines that are already out there. It made the decision a little bit easier. This particular vaccine is used as similar technology to what most people are familiar with. So the hepatitis B vaccine, the pertussis vaccine, the messenger RNA sort of gives your immune system instructions on how to make the immunity. Whereas this one actually gives you the protein already. So it's less work for your immune system. Dr. Bryce Poundchick is leading the phase three trial in Pleasant Hills. It's two shots, three weeks apart. And then what happens is there's a crossover halfway through the trial. If you did not get the vaccine, you will get it. And then it'll compare the two groups. So everybody gets vaccinated. 10-date. There has been no really reported serious effects with blood clotting or heart inflammation. Some of the things, especially this is an adolescent trial. Just like the J&J vaccine, Nova Vax can also be kept in a refrigerator which makes it a lot easier for both storage and distribution. Which is another reason health experts say the Nova Vax shot is more appealing. If you want to open up international travel and business, you have to think of this vaccine is easier to store and distribute. So the sooner that the rest of the world also gets vaccinated, the more that we also can lead a more normal life. Every time somebody allows themselves to get sick with COVID, not only are they at risk and their friends and family at risk, but they are an incubator to let COVID make more variants so we can get more hard to treat variations of COVID that's going to extend this disease forever and ever and ever as long as people are getting sick. I have four kids at home, so it's like we want to, their biggest goal is to get back to normal, you know, to get back to some type of normalcy. So the only way that's going to happen in my opinion is if people are vaccinated. Which she hopes can end this pandemic once and for all. Amy Waters, KDK News."
CDC Panel Recommends Novavax: How It Differs From Other Vaccines,NBC News,2022-07-19,D4lI2SC_lrk,"and breaking within the last few minutes here, a CDC advisory panel unanimously recommending the use of the Novavax COVID vaccine for adults last week, the FDA authorized the two-shot vaccine as well. NBC's Antelia Hilton is tracking the other outbreak we are monitoring now, monkeypox. Let's begin though with NBC News Senior Medical correspondent Dr. John Torres and NBC News Medical reporter Berkley Lovelace Jr. Dr. John, I'll start with you if we can and this breaking news about the Novavax vaccine, help our viewers understand how it's different from the other vaccines out there. And here, like you mentioned, the advisory committee for the CDC just recommended that it go ahead and be given and now the CDC director will step in and give her recommendation as well, which by all indications will be, you know, thumbs up and it will be good to go. But what this does is it gives us a third type of vaccine against COVID and that's important because some people were hesitant to take the mRNA, Pfizer and Moderna vaccine or the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which is what we call a viral vector. And so this is one, it's more of an older technology, think hepatitis B vaccine, it's been around for a while. And what it does is it uses a protein-based vaccine, basically, where it does is introducing a protein from the cell wall into the body. So instead of the body being induced to make that protein, which then activates the immune system, it's giving the body that protein along with something else that can help boost that up. And so, like I said, Erin, the important thing here is for people who might have been hesitant to get the mRNA vaccines because they were concerned that the technology might be too new or the Johnson and Johnson vaccines because that technology was new. This is an older technology. They don't think it's going to replace all the other ones, but there's certainly going to be one more tool in our tool bag, Erin. Thanks for watching our YouTube channel.

Novavax COVID-19 vaccine trial opens at UT Health San Antonio and University Health,University Health,2021-01-06,3jkNJxXEn1I,"This is a Phase III trial of human volunteers and in previous studies in Phase I and in preclinical trials, this vaccine has been shown to have good antibody response, so people who receive the vaccine developed antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19, and also a good T cell response, which is sort of the other part of our immune system, which helps us fight viruses. This vaccine is a protein-based vaccine, so what it does is it takes a little piece of the virus that causes COVID-19, so that virus called SARS-CoV-2, and it actually takes a piece of the spike protein. So if you've seen those pictures, it has those bumps on it, it's one of those bumps. So it's not the virus itself, it cannot give you COVID-19, which I think is really important, it's just a tiny piece of it, and that enters into your body, and then your body develops an immune response to it, it creates antibodies. So then, when you later on, if you're exposed to COVID-19, your body already knows how to fight the virus, and so it does that before you even get sick from it. The overall Novavaxra will enroll around 30,000 participants. We hope to be able to offer participation to around 500 people here in San Antonio. Anybody who is an adult, who is interested in participating, should come and talk to us. We have a priority for people who are more at risk for COVID-19, so this would include people who are older, who we know, are more likely to have more severe COVID-19, people with comorbidities, so people with conditions like diabetes or heart disease, and of course, we have unfortunately seen COVID-19 having a lot of impact in our communities of color, so we would encourage those folks to join as well. So this vaccine is a shot, and it's given in two doses that are 21 days apart. So someone would come in for the first shot, we make sure they're doing okay, and then everything goes well, they come in for the shot three weeks later. Two-thirds of the people who enroll in the trial will get the vaccine, and one-third will get placebo. Yes, that is always something that we look for in phase one and phase two trials. So from the data that we have so far, there are no serious adverse events, which is great news. The main side effects that we're seeing are some pain and tenderness at the side of the injection, and then some people develop some fatigue, some muscle aches, a little bit of malaise afterwards. This is the best and safest way for us to get a vaccine that can protect our community. Randomized control trials are very important, both to tell us that a vaccine is safe and safe to use in a wide variety of people, and also, even most importantly, that it protects you from the actual infection. So we're very excited to have the opportunity to participate in this trial, and to be hopefully adding one more tool that will help us end the COVID-19 pandemic. ."
Phase 3 of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine trial underway in Maryland | FOX 5 DC,FOX 5 Washington DC,2021-01-06,RZQrdaFOHlY,"the vaccine. The new vaccine is by Nova Vax and is set to be different than the others. The school was also involved with both FDA approved Pfizer and Moderna vaccines with more on the vaccine trial joining me now as professor Doctor Monica McCartner. Doctor McCartner, thank you for joining us this morning. We appreciate your time. Thank you. Can you tell us a little bit about this phase three trial with Nova Vax? What is it look like? Yeah, so this is a phase three trial similar to previous trials that will have two vaccinations at 21 days apart followed by safety and follow up for the efficacy of the vaccine. We know there was a particular focus placed on the demographic of this group, particularly with those who have been disproportionately impacted by the virus. Can you elaborate on that? Yes, we're really trying to recruit a diverse population so that we cover all of the people who will be affected by this virus with the vaccine trial. Now, Nova Vax is pretty different from Pfizer and Moderna. How is it different and what's the benefit? Or is there any? But how is it different? So it's different in that this is a protein vaccine so that the spike protein, the surface protein of the coronavirus is used directly in the vaccine, along with an adjuvant, which is something that's added to help guide the immune response. And so there's no virus you cannot get COVID from this vaccine. Is there a particular benefit to that and do you target certain demographics or certain groups of people based on that? Well, the main benefit of this vaccine is that the storage conditions are above freezing is one of the really primary benefits and that will allow easier distribution of the vaccine once it's available. Gotcha. What are the steps in this phase three trial? The first step is to enroll participants, like I said, from diverse backgrounds to receive the vaccinations and then we'll follow those participants who receive either vaccine or placebo. And then we'll follow those participants who receive either vaccine or placebo to determine if they develop symptomatic COVID-19 infection to determine the efficacy of the vaccine. Now, this is obviously a pretty important role that the University of Maryland School of Medicine is playing in all of this. Can you elaborate on what it means for the school and what exactly are they doing? Right. So we're enrolling approximately 400 to 500 participants in participant trial. And really, like I said, trying to enroll diverse populations so that we can really have a vaccine that is efficacious for all people. What's your people know if they'd like to be a part of the trial or would like to get more information? How do they do that? Yeah, so you can contact us at www.cvdtrials.org or text COVID research to five to eight five five. Gotcha. Is there anything they should have to do with COVID-19? So we're trying to do that in one advance as to what might qualify or disqualify them from this study. We do need people who have some risk of developing COVID-19. So they have to be somewhat out and about, either for work or personal reasons, but we are accepting people even with pre-existing medical conditions as well as healthy individuals. Any age in particular age range that you're looking for? We're looking for adults, 18 and older, and really trying to enroll individuals above the age of 65 as well as younger adults. And Dr. MacArthur, I want to ask you, you obviously have been doing this in terms of medicine, the field of medicine for many years. What does it feel for you to be a part of something like this? We've seen what some have called a miracle in terms of the development of these vaccines. Moderna visor is visor. What does it mean for you to be involved in this process? It's very exciting. I'm really hopeful that you know, this vaccine will provide something else in our arsenal against COVID-19 and really allow us to stop this pandemic. OK. Professor Doctor Monica MacArthur with the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Thank you for talking to us this morning, and of course we wish you all very best as you start this trial the vaccine. Thank you so much. We appreciate your time."
Novavax: COVID-19 vaccine over 90% effective in U.S. trial | ANC,ANC 24/7,2021-06-14,l27T_FnT_xY,"Novavax says a US-based clinical trial has shown its COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90 percent effective against a variety of variants. The support has the details. Novavax reported late-stage data from its US-based clinical trial on Monday, showing its vaccine is more than 90 percent effective across a variety of variants of the virus. The Maryland-based company said the study of nearly 30,000 volunteers in the United States and Mexico puts Novavax on track to file for emergency authorization in the US and elsewhere in the third quarter this year. Novavax's protein-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate was more than 93 percent effective against the predominant variants of COVID-19 that have been worrying scientists and public health officials. He said that during the trial, the B-117 variant, first discovered in Britain, became the most common variant in the United States. At every search and development, Dr Gregory Glenn told Reuters that the company also detected variants first found in Brazil, South Africa and India, among its trial participants. The vaccine was 91 percent effective among volunteers at high risk of severe infection and 100 percent effective in preventing moderate and severe cases of COVID-19. It was roughly 70 percent effective against COVID-19 variants that Novavax was unable to identify. Novavax says it's on track to produce 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter of 2021 and 150 million doses per month in the fourth quarter of this year. Back in May, Novavax said it had begun its regulatory filing in India in partnership with the Serum Institute of India, which is contracted to make Novavax shots. Here at home, the Philippine Food and Drug Administration says Novavax has submitted a letter of intent to apply for emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine by July or August. Over 1.8 million Filipinos have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. That's according to Vaccines Arc, or Deepogalvestre, who says the Philippine is just close to reaching the 7 million mark in terms of total doses administered. National Task Force against COVID-19 Deputy Chief Implementer bin Sizon adds the government has been administering a million doses per week for almost a month now. Despite the increase in the pace of inoculations, delays continue to pound the distribution of newly delivered jabs. The 1 million sign of act doses that arrived in the country last week have yet to be deployed, as it waits for the arrival of its certificate of analysis from the manufacturer. Still, Manafanyang insists that the Philippine is faring better than its Southeast Asian neighbors, but the independent R-World and Data Tracker showed the Philippine's rank 9 out of 11 Southeast Asian Asians in terms of the percentage of population vaccinated. It's just some two ways of looking at the numbers. One is absolute numbers, and we remain second. There is no deception. And another is a percentage number, which depends on your population. Natural 50 percent of Singapore, which is only 4 million. There is absolutely no deception when you use absolute numbers."
Ask Dr. Nandi: FDA approves Novavax's updated COVID-19 vaccine,WXYZ-TV Detroit | Channel 7,2023-10-04,9M64s4Z9TOk,"In today's help to learn another COVID-19 vaccine has been approved by the FDA. The updated shop by NovaVax is a more traditional vaccine and provides an option to mRNA vaccines. So joining us now is our chief health editor, Dr. Parthenandi. And Dr. Nandi, what's the key difference between NovaVax's shop and Pfizer's? Important question, right? So Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine uses mRNA technology, Linda. This teaches the sales how to make a protein that triggers or gets the immune response to go against the COVID-19. Whereas the NovaVax vaccine, the spike protein, what's already pre-made in the shop also contains an additive that helps rev up the immune response. Now protein-based technology, it's been around for a long time. Other vaccines that use this type include hepatitis B, HPV and tetanus toxoid. That's not to say that the mRNA vaccine lack an credibility. The technology platform is certainly new to the public for us. But the research has been around since the early 1990s. As for the question of which vaccine works best, I don't think there's much difference between them. They all provide good response and target the XBB Omnitron sub variants. However, when it comes to side effects like pain and muscle aches, we know about those. NovaVax is reported to have fewer and overall these protein-based vaccines, Linda Tenda, have less serious side effects. So what age is this vaccine authorized for? Does the CDC still have to approve it? Yeah, important questions. So people who are age 12 and up were previously vaccinated, but not have received the mRNA shot are eligible for the NovaVax shot. Also, those who are unvaccinated can get two doses. As for CDC approval, it's already been granted, which is surprising. The Agency's Advisory Committee had voted in favor of recommending updated monovillan vaccines targeting XBB. As authorizer approved by the FDA. This is unusual, but the Advisory Committee had already reviewed NovaVax later. This data in a meeting in September, that means that the protein-based vaccine should be available very soon in the company. Well, they say that millions of doses are ready to ship and will go to pharmacies and healthcare providers in the coming days. Once again, I talk about the second broken record. I want to emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated. Why? Because COVID infections and hospitalizations are rising and I expect numbers to continue to increase as we enter colder winter months when folks are spending more time indoors. Remember COVID-19 vaccines highly effective in preventing the most of your outcomes if you get infected. And they do not contain any live virus and cannot cause an infection. People think that sometimes. The best time to get an updated shot that will help protect against the current circulating virus, variants is actually now, I'll be getting mine this Friday. So listen, and people say, well, I'm not going to get infected, but you know, or get seriously it. But if you get infected, you can give it to someone else that can get seriously ill. So I still recommend getting vaccinated and do it now. And that's the key piece, is that it's not just about you? It's about the community, right? And we've become a little bit of a me, me society. It's really about all of us and protecting those are more vulnerable. All right, thanks a lot, Doc. Hey, my pleasure. You're taking care of allways. Of course. And if you have a health question for the good doctor, you can email him, Dr. Nandy at AskDrNandy.com, or send it to us on Facebook or Twitter, we'll get it right to him."
Novavax Covid vaccine approved: An expert answers your coronavirus jab questions,The Telegraph,2020-12-30,r6l2YgO7Xtg,"We've been collecting some common vaccine queries for all of our readers and we've put them to an expert which we hope will be really useful for you. Dr Michael Fitzpatrick is a GP and an author who writes about vaccines. For the last six months he's been working in a COVID hot hub in Hackley. So for all Dr Fitzpatrick's answers on your questions around safety concerns, side effects, whether you can trust the vaccine or if it might alter your DNA, please keep watching. They're really really useful responses. We can't get it soon enough. And obviously we'd like a longer time to be able to study what the possible adverse effects may have got a bounce that against the problems that the disease is causing at the moment. And as far as we know, the tests that have been done are as rigorous as possible within the constraints of the time available. And so far it looks very promising. So the balance of the possible benefits are very clearly in front of us because the rate that people are dying and not only dying, they're also getting very serious illness. So again, we have to bounce a national possibility that there may be adverse effects but so far so good. So I think the balance lies overwhelmingly in favour of taking the vaccine. This is a great tribute to the international cooperation of scientists that have worked over the last six months to first of all sequencing the new virus and newly developed virus and then developing the vaccine to deal with it. So it's a remarkable scientific achievement to get a vaccine at this stage. In the past, these various stages of the development of the vaccine have done one after the other in a series where these ones have been done in parallel. So they started off manufacturing it almost. You know, but when it first became able to be formed in anticipation of the success of the trials, which fortunately after that was successful. So that saved an enormous amount of time on the traditional way of doing it. I'm afraid if we're waiting for 100 percent effective, we're never going to get it because the trials so far of the various vaccines, some of them have shown 90 percent efficacy, some of them have shown 94.5 percent efficacy, which is in comparison with vaccines in the past, extraordinarily effective in some respects, it's unlikely to be sustained at that level because the flu vaccine last year was about 50-60 percent effective. And other vaccines are, you know, 78 percent you're very pleased with that as a result. So anything 90 percent is phenomenally effective. We've got very good evidence that people have got COVID are capable of transmitting it and what's even more difficult about COVID, people who don't have symptoms of it are capable of transmitting it to other people. We know to so far that the vaccine can present prevented both from causing disease and probably from being transmitted. That is not exactly clear, they won't be until we've had some experience with the vaccine. So we've got no possibility of knowing until we've had some experience of it in use, whether, you know, will be effective in stopping transmission. But the signs are very good, we just have to keep it very close on it. No, there's no evidence that that could be the case. What's not entirely clear, and it won't be clear for some time, is if you've had the COVID in the past, how much protection, how much immunity that creates for you going into the future. One of the things about a lot of viral diseases, if you get the new infection, you get antibodies to your body, you have antibodies to it, and so you're only likely to get it again for a certain period of time, which varies with different viruses. And that's also true with various vaccines, it gives you immunity for a certain period of time. So we don't know how long the immunity lasts, that if you've already had COVID, it does seem as though having had the disease does give you protection again, about having it again. And having the vaccination will give you another boost to your immunity against any future exposure. So it won't do any harm, and it may do you some good. There's no particular reason why this should be it. It's not like a drug that interacts that you might, you know, is absorbed through the stomach and the gastroenterstinal system, so and processing that way. There's no particular indication that it's good interact with any recognized medications, and so there shouldn't be any problem of that sort. I don't think there's likely to be a problem only with the question is that it does seem a bit greedy when there's going to be shortage of distribution and logistical problems of getting air around to that, so the number of people are going to need it. I don't think there's a problem of interaction between the different vaccines, because they're working in quite different ways. The numbers have not been made widely available yet, so we can't give categorical answers to that, but the early reports suggest that the studies have included older people and people with underlying health conditions. Obviously there that people are most vulnerable to COVID, and they're the most people, the most important to get protection in the vaccine. Think about the messenger RNA vaccine, is it? It is a novel technology in the sense that it hasn't been used in any vaccine that's currently in use, but it has been under development for 10 or 15 years, so it's not in the museum, all sorts of other research, perhaps to say. The basic use of messenger RNA is not new, but it's used in a new vaccine. The messenger RNA is in structs, other molecules could use proteins. They can't work backwards, it only works forward, so it's absolutely... The people have worried about it, can alter the human DNA, go into the human genome. There's no possibility that it's not possible, so that's not going to happen. The vaccine can be given to particular people who are particularly vulnerable to protect them individually. If you have that option of vaccinating a wide number of people in society, so younger people who we know are much lower risk, but younger people may not be at risk of the disease, but they can circulate the virus in the community. Once it's spreading widely in the community, many will spread to people who are particularly vulnerable. So if you're a young person, getting the vaccine may not be a brilliant or brilliant case for you personally, but it will protect the older people in the community and more vulnerable people, and so by you getting the vaccine, you also protect that."
Novavax CEO: Our COVID-19 Vaccine Appeals To The Vaccine-hesitant | On Leading,Fortune Magazine,2022-11-21,IKXSzBov-Lw,"Stan, thank you so much for joining us to talk about your company Novavax and your new COVID vaccine. It was only a few months ago that you came out with the fourth vaccine in the U.S. So now you're competing against the Pfizer vaccine, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson. Tell us why would someone turn to the new Novavax vaccine compared to the established ones that have already been on the market for some time? We have some characteristics of our vaccine that make it more attractive. It's a very stable vaccine. It's used at refrigerated temperatures. You don't have to go through the minus 20 or minus 70 degrees freezing. That makes it easier to use. I think that people recognize that this is a type of vaccine using a protein injected into the arm that they've gotten all their lives with different vaccines, childhood vaccines and hepatitis vaccines. So there's a comfort level and then there's data that suggests that our vaccine may last longer, have greater durability and give you a breadth of protection as the virus changes over time and you get Omicron BA5 and you get the next generation of virus. It's hopeful that our vaccine is broad enough to protect against all of those. So how would you describe demand for the Novavax vaccine when you launched it a couple of months ago, orders were weak and your stock tumbles. What about now? Well, you're talking about US. We've been in a global market for some time. For instance, in Korea and Japan, we're getting in Australia. We're getting a lot of acceptance. The vaccine's been available for a lot longer. In the US, it's taken longer to get approvals and so we're just only recently in the market. And so our expectation is that with data that we will be able to increase demand, increase market share over the coming, not only coming year, but years with our vaccine. Well, what's your strategy to compete with Pfizer and Moderna? They've been selling millions of vaccines and boosters and even now for kids. How do you compete with that? Every week we get new sets of data that shows that I think allows me to predict that that our vaccine will be demonstrably better, more differentiated than the current vaccines. You know, it's taking you a little longer to get your vaccine out compared to Pfizer and Moderna. Do you think that even though Novavax has a good product, it's just too late? No, it's not too late. We're unfortunately, we're stuck with COVID for a long time. And like flu, COVID is going to be bringing up new surprises to us from year to year. And I think that the vaccine that shows it's most effective against these new variants is the one that ultimately will win. And I think that's our vaccine. Well, you mentioned a moment ago that your vaccine is protein-based and it's what most people are used to receiving when they get vaccines. Has this made a difference in getting people who have been hesitant to get vaccinated to feel more comfortable using Novavax? Yeah, I think our vaccine would appeal to people who are vaccine hesitant because they don't understand vaccines very well. People who are hesitant for because they don't understand the newest technology might just say, good, I've been waiting for this and I'll use it. Well, have you gotten any feedback that your vaccine is getting to people who have been holding off from getting vaccinated by your competitors? Yes, we get a lot of feedback. If you look at my if you look at my in-basket inbox and my computer, every day I get lots of feedback from people who have said explained why they haven't gotten vaccinated for the past year or two. And now they're anxiously going to the pharmacy to get ours. You know, Stan, most people didn't know much about Novavax until COVID. It was a small struggling biotech company. But once the U.S. government awarded your company more than one and a half billion dollars to develop a COVID vaccine, you were in the spotlight. You had already been CEO for 10 years at the company, but now suddenly the world was watching you. What was that like for you? We were actually too busy to pay much attention to that. Truthfully, we went from, I think it was January 12th when the gene sequence of COVID became known. And we put all of our efforts. We took them off flu and put them on COVID. And truly the team has been working seven days a week for the last two and a half years. There isn't a day that we don't have some meeting, including Sundays. And we started to face a phase three trial in the U.S. on Christmas day, year before last. And so it's part of our life right now and we'll be for some time. Well, when you started working a serious way on the COVID vaccine, the company had only 150 people. It didn't even have manufacturing capacity, but still you were able to transform it into a global vaccine developer. What did it take for you to ramp up operations? A lot of energy, a lot of perseverance. We had early on some data in non-human primates that showed that our vaccine worked really, really well. And those data usually translate well into humans. And everybody in the scientific community recognized that. So we had lots of people who we had gained credibility and we were able to convince people to open up manufacturing capacity. Unfortunately, that takes time. I mean, usually it takes many years. We did it in many months, but nevertheless, it still takes time. And we've gone from, as you say, around 150 people in the U.S. and Europe two and a half years ago. And now we have over 2,000 people and several manufacturing sites. How would you describe what you did as CEO to lead the project and to lead the team? I don't think it was anything magical. I think it's relatively easy when you've been able to hire a good group of people and your mission is so, so clear. And your technology and the tools you have are so unique. The people in the company that have joined the company the past three years and have been working with it are all equally motivated. Because, as I say, the mission is not just COVID. It's also COVID and flu and other vaccines. I don't have to do anything special to motivate these people. They're self-motivated. So what's next for NOVAVAX? How do you want people describing the company three, four, five years from now? Nobody's ever built an independent vaccine company in the last 50 years or more. And I think that's exactly what NOVAVAX has headed toward. And in five or 10 years, I think everybody's going to know. When they think vaccines, they're going to think about NOVAVAX because they're the best vaccine company."
Northeast Ohio home to Novavax COVID-19 vaccine trial for teenagers,WKYC Channel 3,2021-05-09,ofVJXYh2mec,"As the FDA is set to authorize the Pfizer vaccine this week for 12 to 15 year olds, trials are now underway right here in Northeast Ohio for a potential fourth COVID vaccine in the US. Well, you'll joins us live with details on how local teens are taking part in the Nova Vax trials. High will. Yeah, Lena, you really nailed it. Everyone's heard of the three main vaccines. We'll call them Johnson and Johnson Moderna and Pfizer by now. But there's a fourth one that they're concentrating on here in South Euclid at senders pediatrics here behind me because they begin trials for 12 to 17 year olds on Nova Vax. They're hoping to get about 100 people in the next few weeks as part of 75 sites around the country participating in this FDA sponsored clinical trial of Nova Vax, which is a similar vaccination to hepatitis B HPV Ebola, which have all been used for many years. This is a phase three trial where two thirds of the participants will get the vaccine. One third will get a placebo, but everyone will get the vaccine within six months. Volunteers also compensated. They'll be monitored as they test for antibodies and side effects so far. The side effects though reported have been exactly the same as the other vaccines. If anything kind of a 24 hour case of flu-like symptoms, Dr. Shelley senders who has been running trials for over 20 years says it's amazing to see how many kids want to be part of the solution. The children have been inspirational to me because the children are the ones who are saying, you know, we're not doing this to make the money. We're doing this because we're going to make a difference in a generation from now. We're going to be able to tell our kids that the pandemic stopped because of things that we did by going the extra mile. This Nova Vax vaccine originally began trials in the UK so far, 96 percent effective, 91 percent effective against variant. So Lena, pretty good number so far in the early trials for this vaccination coming up tonight at 11. We'll hear from a local girl and why she was first in line and wanted to be a part of this trial. Wow, looking forward to hearing from her. Thanks so much. We'll see you at 11."
Study finds Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is effective | Coronavirus | 9 News Australia,9 News Australia,2021-06-14,hI3fxwlqq5c,"We have heard this morning that Nova Vax jab is 90 percent effective against COVID-19. This is the one that we have 51 million doses on order. At what stage or how far away is that from being approved? And once it's approved, how soon can we be getting jabs in people's arms? It's hard to know exactly, but it certainly is great in using how effective this vaccine is in these large clinical trials. And of course, this is a very different vaccine to the ones we're already using. So to be very complimentary in terms of some of its properties, the data released overnight should underpin approvals in some countries very soon, I would think. And that would mean hopefully the approval in our country won't be too far behind that. I think it's still some months away, but it's certainly a vaccine we should be using before the end of the year. The good news is that even if it is approved, Queensland should be vaccinated by 2025. The way it's going. Look, I think that's a fair bit. No, we've obviously had our challenges up here. And again, I think it's time to move past whose fault it is. And just realise how important the vaccine really is. There are still a lot of people I think waiting. And there's a real risk of not vaccinating. We've seen that unfold in Victoria, and we know this virus will keep coming. And so it is vitally important that we do get moving with this. And I guess to reinforce some of those key messages that the two vaccines we do have remain very safe and very effective in the people in which we're using them. Well, Paul, I mean, the Prime Minister is about to send a runner letter saying, please get vaccinated. Is that going to help? Well, I'm going to think more communication to that effect can only be a good thing. But I think we do need to get our messaging right and focus on those key messages that the vaccines are safe and effective. There are real consequences of being as far behind as we are. And a real risk in that given that we know this virus will keep coming. And I think part of this too will be that soon hopefully we'll be able to link some deserved freedoms to being completely vaccinated. Because we know people that have had their two doses. I've had my two doses of AstraZeneca now that they are protected. And so I think giving those people some freedoms they've deserved for that will be a big step forward, like perhaps being able to move more freely during lockdowns or with border restrictions in place. Good on you, Paul. Thank you so much. Thanks, Paul. How's your sceptical about letters work? Oh, that's weird. I actually don't know vaccine hesitancies. The biggest issue here, you've got plenty of people who actually want to get the vaccine who can't. I was talking about the letter though. Yeah, no, well, I just, I think a letter. Well, anything, as Paul said, anything helps, I guess. You see, I think sending letters to plus 70s works. They love getting letters. But the over 70s aren't the ones you need to convince. It's the younger ones. So you say, if the prime minister sent you a letter, would you go, okay? Well, I'm going anyway. I don't think young people are a problem, I like. Don't you like, I just called you young? Yeah, thank you. That's all right. It was an accident. I didn't mean to do that. We're going places, Ellie and I. I'm sure in the arm for one of Australia's biggest vaccine bets this morning, we're the study finding the Nova Vax jab to be 90 percent effective against COVID-19. For more, we are joined by Nova Vax's chief commercial officer, John Trezino in the US. John, thank you for your time this morning. This is exciting news for your team. A pleasure. Good morning. It's a very exciting time for the team. The results from our US and Mexico Phase III trial were just spectacular. And in my opinion, with data showing that the overall efficacy was over 90 percent effective. But we also had an interesting challenge in this study in that we had over 83 percent of the cases were of the variant strain and yet still achieved an impressive vaccine efficacy in that subset of the population of the trial of over 93 percent. So good data all the way around 100 percent efficacy in the high risk population. So we're just thrilled with the performance of this vaccine and the benefit that we're going to be able to bring to the globe. Look, we're thrilled to hear it because we have 51 million doses on order. How far off are they, Urecon? So we're, you know, we still have a little bit of a regulatory process to finalize, but we're making significant progress. We've been communicating that we expect to have our regulatory submissions in multiple jurisdictions, including in Australia, within the next several months. Will you be able to produce them fast enough? Yeah, we're already producing and I think that's important to understand is that we're here, manufacturing at multiple GMP facilities around the globe, getting the regulatory submissions in place and then once we do get regulatory approval, we can begin shipping immediately. Okay, that is great news. Thanks for joining us this morning. John, we appreciate it. Welcome. Thank you. Browns."
"Here's how Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax compare in race for COVID-19 vaccine",ABC7 News Bay Area,2020-08-10,odonTQkmf-8,"The race to develop a COVID vaccine is not only shifting into high gear. It turns out drug companies are following wildly different maps to find the finish line. The most important thing in a vaccine is the idea. UCSF professor Dr. J. Levy is tracking efforts worldwide, including the roughly half dozen domestic vaccine trials now getting underway in the United States. He says one of the most intriguing is by the company Moderna, which is using a new strategy known as messenger RNA, essentially writing a genetic script and injecting it into the patient, coaxing their bodies into creating a safe fragment of the COVID virus and triggering an immune response. The most interesting is the messenger, just the RNA. I mean, that's brand new. Drug giant Pfizer is also working with the technique, but it's not the only innovation in play. Researchers at Oxford have used a chimpanzee virus to create a so-called Trojan horse, job to carry fragments of the COVID virus into the body without being detected, leaving the immune system to attack them. And then that is your vaccine. Then you immunize humans with that. Stanford immunology professor, Bolly Pollendran, says other companies, like Novavax, are using their own proprietary add-ons, known as adjuvants, to boost the overall effectiveness of their vaccines. While Johnson and Johnson says they're building on a vaccine technology they recently used to help fight an Ebola outbreak in Africa, a remarkable range of strategies unveiled in just a matter of months. So that's just been stunning progress. The first of U.S. back vaccines from a donor began phase three trials last month. Others from Oxford, AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson and Novavax are lined up in the shoot in a U.S. trial schedule stretching through the fall. Ultimately, researchers are hoping more than one might be successful, offering options against a worldwide enemy that has so far provided very few."
Coronavirus vaccine: Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is more than 89% effective,Yahoo Finance,2021-01-28,AktZxQ1e6cw,"Thank you. Nova Vax, Aludada on the effectiveness of its COVID vaccine. Angelique, come on. He has the details for us on. Thanks, Shana. Yep. So what we hear is that Nova Vax has announced just now that they're UK trial, the phase three trial there produced 89.3 percent efficacy in their in their COVID 19 vaccine. And that's important, of course, because we know that that translates into what they're likely to see here in the US where they aren't face three trials. We do know that, of course, because of that virulent UK strain of the virus, they were able to capture that in their trials and said that the vaccine held up against that. They also do have phase two B trials in South Africa, and they are looking at pretty significant efficacy right over there as well. But of course, that is just the phase two trials. And so we know that this is, you know, addressing two of the major variance of concern right now. So that's really good news in addition to the fact that we got these results now. Of course, we still have to wait for what the US trial results will eventually be back to you guys. Hey real quick, Angelique, is this one of those MRNA vaccines or is this a more traditional vaccine? It's it's neither. It's actually it's a different technology, but it's not one that hasn't been used. It's based on DNA. It's a different type of technology altogether."
Novavax COVID-19 vaccine 90% effective in clinical trials,CBS News,2021-06-14,dGOZWsjH_X8,"All right, some positive news in the nation's vaccination effort after another manufacturer announces its promising results from its clinical trials. Novavax released data today on its prevent 19 shot. It said to have an overall efficacy rate of more than 90 percent. And trials found the two dose vaccine is 93 percent effective against the predominant variant circulating right now. Dr. Ron Elfinbine is the medical director and owner of First Call Medical Center. He joins us now to discuss this new data and a lot more. So Dr. Elfinbine, what is different about this vaccine compared to the other three already in use here in the United States? And it does start to feel given that there are other countries that are struggling to vaccinate their citizens that we are are are blessed and lucky to have a wide range of choices. But do we need a fourth vaccine? Dr. Elfinbine. Dr. Ron Elfinbine, you hit the nail on the head there. Glad, you know, it's it's one extra one that we probably in the United States probably don't need at this particular time because we have we have surplus of vaccine and we have people that don't want the vaccine. So we have way more vaccine than we have people that want it in this country, which is kind of a shame. But it's great that we have this fourth option now. Now you asked a question that what is different about this vaccine? Well, the Novavax vaccine, unlike Johnson and Johnson, which is sort of the traditional, it uses a cold virus to kind of infect ourselves to then get ourselves to sort of develop the immunity. The Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines are mRNA vaccines so they get ourselves to sort of start producing proteins that our body reacts to. This particular vaccine, the Novavax uses what's called the nanotechnology, which is a proprietary technology that they developed that they say allows them to sort of change the vaccine very quickly and develop vaccines very quickly. It's the first of its kind. It's a pretty interesting vaccine and it's a pretty interesting science. I mean, this whole thing has been fascinating to think about it from a scientific perspective. Within within a year and a half, we now have less than a year and a half. We now have, as you said, four vaccines available to treat a virus that was brand new in 2019, which is just completely unheard of and absolutely amazing. This vaccine in particular will be great for the rest of the world because it doesn't require ridiculous refrigeration. It can be stored at regular refrigeration temperatures and it is a two-shot vaccine 21 days apart with incredibly high efficacy. So this would be great for poor third world countries versus the Pfizer vaccine, which Pfizer has just agreed to donate two billion doses to the rest of the world. But unfortunately, it requires to be kept at minus 70 degrees, which most countries can't do, except at very, very few centers. So this vaccine and the NOVAVAX really would be a game changer for the rest of the world. And that may mean that it would be particularly good when it comes to tackling some of these variants. The Delta variant is on its way to becoming the predominant strain of COVID here in America. In an interview with CBS News is Jan Crawford, Pfizer CEO spoke about how effective this Pfizer vaccine is against this variant. So I want to play some of what I have to say. Okay. I feel quite comfortable about to cover it. We will not need a special vaccine for it. The current vaccine should cover it when a new variant emerges immediately. We are testing how the current vaccine behaves compared to Israel. So this is good news for people who are vaccinated, particularly with the Pfizer shop. But what about Moderna or Johnson and Johnson? Yeah, that's a good question. You know, their preliminary data is preliminary and it seems to support that it is effective as well. But we don't know those numbers yet because it hasn't really been published. You know, the Pfizer vaccine is the data says it's 88 percent effective against the Delta variant, which is the B16172 or so-called Indian variant, which is now, as you said, Henry, the dominant strain in most of the world now. So people with Pfizer should feel comfortable that they're going to be okay. But you know, you're right. The other vaccines we don't really know yet at this particular time. We need more information. So there's some new CBS polls, CBS News polls that show more Americans are venturing out whether they have gotten their shots or not. In fact, unvaccinated Americans appear more comfortable going to crowded events, we're eating in restaurants than those who are vaccinated. I find these polls remarkable. And certainly, for example, Dr. Alfinbine and Emory, I've made my return to the gym last week. And if you are fully vaccinated, you don't need to wear your masks. That's what the gym's policies are. You don't need to wear your mask at the gym. But if you are not fully vaccinated, you must wear your mask. But given what these poll numbers show, you know, I don't want to be that dude walking around thinking, is this guy vaccinated? And he's here, Huffing and Puffing on the treadmill, or is he not? And I have no criteria to base my analysis on other than human frailty, right? In other words, I'm like in my brain, thinking like the way he's dressed must mean that he's not vaccinated. So I mean, what does this mean for her? I mean, being a little humorous, but it is a little concerning because we've got to deal with this delta variant. What does it mean? What do these numbers tell you? Yeah, when I read this poll, I was completely shocked. I thought I was misreading it. I had to read it twice because I was like, is this true? You know, I mean, two unvaccinated people are twice as likely as vaccinated people to travel and go on cruises and date and go to the gym as you said, Vlad, you know, it's just, it's kind of mind-boggling. But I think it sort of goes back to it's a kind of a chicken and egg sort of thing. It's like a vaccinated people are more likely to be, you know, more concerned about COVID. So they will then be more likely to think about this kind of stuff. Where is the unvaccinated people aren't that concerned? So they just say, well, it's not that big a deal. But then remember that the vaccinated people think to themselves, all right, I'm aware that people at the gym and people at the restaurants and stuff are likely to be unvaccinated. Those people who are unvaccinated are out and about, which makes me more likely to catch COVID, which makes me less likely to want to go out. So it's kind of like this vicious cycle, you know, if you think about the demographics of these people in general, I mean, obviously this is generalizing and this is polling data, which we know is can be a little bit unreliable. But, you know, those people who tend to be more concerned about COVID tend to be more liberal, they tend to be older, they tend to have a higher income bracket, and they tend to be of higher education. So, you know, it's just, I think it's kind of this vicious cycle where people say, well, I don't want to catch it. I'm worried about it to begin with. And I know those people out there that don't have it. So I don't want to go out because I might even on the vaccinated, I still might catch it. So it's really crazy and it just deals with human psyche. It's just, but you know, Dr. Alpamine, one of the things that people will say to me and Amary knows as well is that they'll say, well, what are you worried about, right? You trust in the science, they told you, meaning they, you, the government, Fauci, that if you're vaccinated, then you're not at risk. And I understand that. But it's a cascading situation, right? So let's say I catch COVID at the gym from somebody who's unvaccinated. It doesn't affect me. I don't have, I don't get sick. I'm asymptomatic. But I get tested every day when I come into CBS news. The test picks up that I'm COVID positive. All of a sudden, that has an effect on my colleagues, that has an effect on this broadcast, that has an effect on CBS this morning. They're people that I work with that may not be vaccinated. I can spread to. So all of a sudden, now I got to stay at home, and I can't be with Amary or I can't be with you. And it's like a, it's a whole thing, right? I mean, it's not just, you know, I think people sometimes think, well, I'm not going to get sick. So what's the big deal? But, but the reality is I could still, I know that even if I'm vaccinated, the chance of me spreading it, if I catch it, are low, but there's still a chance. And it just means that like, I got to be out of work. I can, you know what I'm saying? It's like this whole series of events that happens. Yeah. And you could certainly make the argument that people who choose not to get vaccinated to some extent are being very selfish because, you know, that you're right. They put everybody else at risk, right? They put everybody else at the chances of you catching it go up because you're now exposed, even though you might not get sick and you might not need to be hospitalized, you can still catch it. And then you're right because then you, you know, you're out of work. The broadcast has to be shut down. The people who, all the people who work there have to be quarantined and all these cascading events that affect potentially thousands of people's lives in livelihoods that because some somebody goes to the gym who the way you happen to work out, and you're doing the right thing, but they might not. They might just say, nah, I don't need to wear my mask. I haven't been vaccinated, but no one's going to know the difference. And now they've just exposed, you know, 30, 40, 50 people. That's a big deal. And you're affecting thousands of people's lives, potentially even millions of people's lives. So, you know, it's a ripple effect, as you said, and that people need to really think through that before they choose. Look, if you choose to not get vaccinated, that's a choice. But then be smart about it. Don't go out without a mask. Don't go out to a gym. Don't violate people's, you know, businesses, policies. Do the right thing. I think that's so good. I mean, we're talking about the impact on the newscast. And just so you know, the broadcast would not be shut down, but I would carry the weight for you, Blacker. But I think, but it's sort of more seriously though, more seriously though, because I do know people who are, you know, recent cancer survivors. These are people that, you know, they are particularly vulnerable. So, maybe they can't get the vaccine right now. And so I ask people out there to think about those people that, you know, the rest of us, maybe spread it to us. We don't actually get sick. We don't know. We have it. But there are other people that it really is sort of a life and death exposure. And they are still wearing their masks and they're not going to the gym. So they're being extra cautious. So, you know, consider the effect that you might have on someone who's more vulnerable. Dr. Ron Alphabine. Once again, always a pleasure talking to you. Thank you so much. Thanks guys. Have a great day. You too."
"Covid Update: Chile's New Lockdown, Novavax Delays Vaccine Deal; Juncker Blasts 'Vaccine War'",Bloomberg Quicktake,2021-03-25,P6qHRX-LCIE,"Now, in other COVID news from around the world, the European Union's vaccine campaign has suffered a new blow. Novavax is delaying signing a contract to supply vaccines due to a shortage in some raw materials. The U.S. biotech company is expected to deliver at least 100 million doses of the Novavax vaccine to the EU with an option for another 100 million. And staying in Europe, the former European Commission chief says the EU should stop its, quote, stupid vaccine war. In a BBC interview, a junk club, Yumkir, said the block has been overly cautious and budget conscious over vaccines. Blaming the commission for not opting for dialogue over supply threats, Yumkir said getting rid of his successor, Ursula Vonderlan, would not be helpful. And Chile extended a lockdown across the capital Santiago as the country struggles to tame a second wave of infections. Santiago is home to roughly 40 percent of Chile's population. The South American nation boasts the world's fastest per capita vaccination campaign, but the fruits of its efforts will likely only be seen by mid-April. A great reminder to all of us that vaccines are not the end of COVID.

Fmr. FDA chief Dr. Gottlieb: Novavax Covid vaccine data looks promising,CNBC Television,2021-03-12,iu_kmY3Q0Ys,"If someone does like a wide variety, we may have another offering pretty soon. Would you think of the Novavax results, Scott? The data looks good. It's consistent with what we saw from the UK trial, the interim analysis. I think the question's gonna be whether or not FDA wants to look at a data set from the United States, a US data set, or is willing to give an authorization based on that UK data set. But the data look good against both B117 and the old Wuhan variant. We need to see more data on 1351, but it looks like another strong entry. And it's also differentiated, as you know, this is probably the first protein-based vaccine that could potentially reach the market. The future of analysis and testing, we've been talking about challenge trials that Andrew's talking about to see. It sounds crazy, but you give someone a small amount, small dose of the virus and see how the different vaccines work. I can imagine doing that. I could imagine doing a start with one vaccine, do a different one for a booster. I could imagine that you'd wanna look at T-cell versus B-cell. How long you get immunity based on the differing vaccines. Over the next five years, will we be conducting all of these trials to see how to best deal with this, which could be a long-term problem? We may well be doing that. We do that for flu, so we do challenge studies for flu. We do it in other more benign illnesses. I think as we get better treatments available, like the monoclonal antibodies and perhaps some other drugs, doing challenge studies in a younger, healthier population, maybe something that we start to do more routinely, as early exploratory studies to look at different vaccines. You wouldn't do this as a sort of primary efficacy study, but in terms of looking at different vaccine constructs, looking at relative antibody response to cell response, you might do a small exploratory study where you do a challenge study. Eventually, we're gonna move to a paradigm probably, where we can use proxies of immune response as a basis for regulatory approval. Where we're not gonna do these big outcome studies. Once we figure out what those proxies are, right now FDA is probably gonna authorize the variant vaccines on the basis of just antibody response. And so we're already moving towards that paradigm. And that's in fact how we license flu vaccines each year. So Scott, do you wanna weigh in on the ongoing discussion and controversy about how we should be handing this? The president says maybe by July, you might be able to have a small group with family members. And then there's others that say at the beginning of this, it was flattened the curve for a little while, journal-to-day lead editorial, lessons of the long COVID year lockdowns made the pandemic suffering far worse than necessary. And then on the other page, the lockdowns weren't worth it. So we're still dealing with that. I heard July and it's like, really not till July, can you even think about hugging a relative? Is that really the most prudent way to do it? Do we have to take that much caution still? Look, I think we're gonna be getting together long before July. I think the majority of Americans are gonna be getting together long before July. And I think we should be giving public health advice that is in line with where people are. And people are, when they feel the risk going down and people feel the risk declining because they've been vaccinated because they see infection levels going down in many parts of the country, they're gonna be willing to take more risk because they sense that their vulnerability is declining. And you know what, they're right. And so people are gonna be out this summer. They're gonna be out well before July. I think the other interesting thing the president noted is that he wants everyone every state to open up eligibility for the vaccines on a before May 1st. I think that's consistent with what we've been saying, which is vaccine eligibility, availability is gonna be wide open in April. So I think most people are gonna be able to get a shot at some point in April, go online, regardless of what category they're in or what comorbidities they might have. We do need to watch certain parts of the country. There are parts of the country where we see infection levels sort of leveling off. And they could have a small upsurge before we see continued declines, hopefully. New York's one of those places, 1526 is becoming more prevalent in New York. They need to step up their vaccinations and make sure that they don't have another surge and infection heading into the spring of the summer. Shepard Smith here, thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."
"Canada Buying Doses of Covid-19 Vaccine From Novavax, J&J",Bloomberg Television,2020-08-31,HOl8bcsU6OI,"What's the certainty that we can in a capitalist society solve the supply chain for vaccine distribution? Well, first of all, thank you for inviting me to be on your program. There is no assurance, but one difference is that we have a lot of time to think about this. It will be months before a vaccine is available. And so we have time to give careful thought to who should be in the priority groups and how we should distribute the vaccine in order to get it to those priority groups. So that is why our, I mean, my colleagues started working on this issue actually a couple months ago. Why would we distribute the report now even though we don't expect the vaccine to be around for another six months or so? When we talk about setting up those priorities, people listening to you could probably say, well, I could probably come up with a list in my head. And it's probably great that the medical community would lead that prioritization. But with so many things in this pandemic, things have become politicized. Is this the danger here that there will be best practices and best advice from the medical community and politicians will override it and set their own agenda? Well, that is a danger, of course. And so the way that we try to counter that is by having a rational, ethical approach to this and making it public and trying to actually encourage the public to get involved in the ongoing discussions about this. So that if there is, you know, if there are recommendations that don't seem right in the people's minds, we have something to point to. So Dr. Toner, if you could summarize the conclusions of your study for us. Yeah, so just to walk you very briefly, we started with very broad ethical principles and work our way down through a framework of process to get to the actual groups. And so we proposed two tiers of people should be vaccinated above the general public from before the general public. And in the first group would be those people who are essential to sustaining the pandemic response. And so that would be healthcare workers who are providing direct patient care to COVID patients who would involve EMS workers involved people are doing the vaccination vaccinations. And the public health people who are on the front lines interacting with the public, but also be people who are greatest risk for COVID-19 or bad outcomes from COVID-19. So people over 65 people with certain underlying health conditions, actually those who have multiple underlying health conditions, people working in nursing homes. And then people who are essential maintain to maintain society. So for example, people who drive buses and trains, people who work in grocery stores and are essential to the food supply teachers and people working schools. So these are the people that we think are most essential to being vaccinated first. We recognize that everybody, eventually we hope, will agree to be vaccinated. It's not so it's not a question of whether people that vaccinated is really a question of who gets vaccinated first in a period of time when there is limited amounts of vaccine."
Does the NOVAVAX Vaccine Work Against Omicron?,Friendly Pharmacy 5,2022-02-17,n_JgoUC8a7s,"Health Canada has approved the NOVAVAX vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Let's talk about it. The NOVAVAX vaccine is a subprotein-based vaccine attached to a nanoparticle and includes an adjuvant which is added to the vaccine to help stimulate an immune response. This is a more traditional approach to vaccination. There are many other protein subunit vaccines currently available. Some of them being hepatitis B and pertussis. In this case, the vaccine is produced initially inside a moth cell, not inside human deltoid muscle like the mRNA vaccine that uses mRNA to produce the spike protein. It's important to note that the spike proteins that are being used are not able to infect cells. They have been modified so they are stabilized and they are not able to cause damage to human tissue. The NOVAVAX vaccine works in this way. Scientists place the spike protein into a virus that only infects insect cells. Then mass amounts of moth cells are infected and the spike proteins replicate. After this, they are harvested. In clinical trials, over 14,000 adults in the UK received the NOVAVAX vaccine, two doses of five micrograms each. There is an additional trial of 30,000 people in the USA and Mexico that also occurred with the NOVAVAX vaccine during the alpha variant. For the purposes of this video, we will just be focusing on the results from the UK. 27.9 percent of adults were 65 years of age and over, 44.6 had coexisting illnesses, and infections were reported in 10 participants in the vaccine group and in 96 in the placebo group. This gave a vaccine efficacy of 89.7 percent. As you can see here, the NOVAVAX vaccine was quite effective in reducing the incidence of infection. You can see that the placebo group had a much higher incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in the per protocol population. Also, no hospitalizations or deaths were reported among the 10 cases that were found in the vaccine group. There were five cases of severe infection that were reported, all of which were in the placebo group. It's important to note that the clinical trials occurred while the alpha variant was more prevalent. Researchers did report that the vaccine did show excellent efficacy against the other variants. The NOVAVAX vaccine is a two-dose vaccine with 21 days between the first and the second dose. An adjuvant is something that is added to the vaccine to help stimulate an immune response. This can increase antibody titers, induce rapid immune response and long-lasting memory. It can reduce the required doses of antigen, and it can also enhance immune responses in the elderly and in young children. The most common side effects from the NOVAVAX vaccine that were reported in clinical trials were headache, fatigue, muscle aches, pain, and tenderness at the injection site, and muscle pain for less than two days. Local events were reported according to the degree of severity. Notably, there were no episodes of anaphylaxis reported, no evidence of vaccine associated enhanced COVID-19, and no events that triggered pre-specified pause rules were observed. There were also no episodes of Gillian Baray syndrome, and no imbalance in myocarditis or paracarditis, or in vaccine-induced immune thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. For severe adverse events classified as grade 4 events were reported in three vaccine recipients. Two participants reported a grade 4 fever, over 40 degrees celsius, one after the first dose, and the other after the second dose. A third participant was found to have had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on PCRSA at baseline. There were two deaths related to COVID-19 during the clinical trial. One was in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group. The death in the vaccine group occurred in a 53-year-old woman, in whom COVID-19 symptoms developed seven days after the first dose. Conveniently, this vaccine can be stored in a regular fridge at 2-8 degrees celsius. The vaccines do increase memory B cells, CD4 and CD8 cells, which shows that it can induce both a humoral and an adaptive immune response. The COVID-19 vaccine group of vaccine and the serum institute have committed to provide more than 1.1 billion doses to the COVAX facility, co-led by the World Health Organization. Additionally, a Montreal facility is set to produce NOVAX known as NOVAX-ILID. This would be the first COVID-19 vaccine to be manufactured in Canada. Studies in children age 5-12 are underway in Mexico and the US. Recent press release suggested 80 percent efficacy at preventing symptomatic infection, mostly with the Delta variant. But what about the Omicron variant? NOVAX-ILID has crossed reactivity versus Omicron. Three doses seem to be better than two, as the antibody response after two doses is modest. This is great news for Canada and this is great news for many countries around the world who have already started to approve the NOVAX vaccine. This is an excellent alternative to an mRNA vaccine that can be manufactured in Canada and given to those who are unable or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine."
Coronavirus vaccine: US commits $1.6 billion to Novavax for COVID-19 vaccine,Yahoo Finance,2020-07-07,1jAeMIk5eVw,"Now to tell us what all this means for the medical community, for you and me, let's check in with Yahoo Finance's medical contributor, Dr. Dara Cass. Dr. Cass, good to see you here again. What's your take? Are you here that the government's, you know, funding Novavax to the tune of $1.6 billion? Are you encouraged by what's happening at that biotech firm? I think, well, I think that I'm encouraged that they're funding vaccine development and that they're funding other therapeutic ideas and we're getting close to some sort of therapeutics or vaccine for this virus. I will say for the Novavax product, I don't know anything about it. It hasn't published any data. Their phase one phase two trial hasn't been published yet. They're going into phase three, which is kind of when you expand out the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate to see if there are any adverse effects on large numbers of patients. But we don't have any data on this particular candidate yet. We know there are hundreds of vaccine candidates out there. So while I'm assuming it's encouraging, they gave this large grant of $1.6 billion to this company for their vaccine candidate. I don't know yet if it's going to be effective at all to actually be coming to market by the end of 2020 or 2021 because we have no actual scientific data yet. Dr. Cass, Dr. Fauci was out yesterday. I think shutting some light on some of these early vaccines, maybe not lasting as long or being as impactful as a vaccine theoretically should be. Why would that be the case? So I think that we're learning a lot more about the immunity response and the antibody response to this virus and how long the antibodies may last for which would confer a longer lasting immunity. This may be a virus that we have to have an annual vaccine for, a booster also. It may be a multi-phase virus. We don't know yet. So I think Dr. Fauci is trying to let people understand that this is still a lot of unknown information and that generating a vaccine this quickly for something this new is unknown to us and we're going to have to continue to ask questions and answer them and be patient while still moving forward. Dr. Cass, want to get your thoughts on Regeneron? That's another company that has received government funding for its antibody test, which is actually going to be entering phase three right now. What do you know about this and should we be optimistic about it? So the Regeneron product is actually an antibody treatment that uses the idea of antibodies to actually use either preventative treatment or early stage treatment in a cocktail form. It's actually two different medications coming together. And I think that these are the innovations we're going to be looking for. Innovative creative ways to actually attack this virus from combination effects, much like we do with HIV. Remember, we don't have a vaccine with HIV, but we've learned how to live with the virus. We've learned how to treat the virus early and now we're seeing it pivot to really a chronic disease. I think we're going to watch a lot of different candidates come through. So I'm encouraged by their general process and their treatment. I think we need to look also at vaccines, therapeutics, and testing. And right now to me, testing is the one, like what we talked about yesterday with BED will help us really get back to a workplace that's reliable and consistent earlier than either the vaccine or the therapeutics. All right, we're going to leave it there. Dr. Derrick has thanks as always for joining us this morning. Thank you. Hey, investors. Zach Guzman here.

Novavax Looking for Volunteers for COVID-19 Vaccine Trials,Montgomery Community Media,2021-01-15,Uxls-uF0IH8,"Novavax has initiated phase 3 for its COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. The vaccine development company is headquartered in Gathersburg and is looking for volunteers to participate in clinical trials. By volunteering, you're creating information that's part of the solution, which is to provide gold standard definitive proof that the vaccine is safe and works. Dr. Gregory Glenn, president of research and development at Novavax, said trials are very thorough in that the FDA requires high vaccine confidence. The amount of scrutiny that a vaccine gets for safety, you couldn't believe it. In fact, with the FDA does, you know, if I came and said, hey, you know, I've got this coin, I flipped it and every time I flipped it, it comes up heads. And you said, that's interesting. Show me the data. And I showed you two points. I flipped it twice. Well, come on. So that's statistics are like that. So the number of coin flips gets you closer and closer to probably with the real behavior of that coin flip is like, right? So that's the same principle with trials. Glenn said it is impossible to contract COVID-19 from the vaccine. The vaccine candidate is the fifth to reach phase three trials in the US. Vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been FDA approved and are being administered across the country. AstraZeneca and Janssen also have candidates in phase three in the US. Glenn said Novavax's phase three could be complete sometime this spring and the company plans to take the same route as Pfizer and Moderna and will seek emergency use authorization from the FDA. Novavax is targeting at risk populations to take part in the trials. We have two local sites, University, Maryland Howard. We're looking for, you know, people of color, Hispanic, Native American and older adults. So it would be really great if they could show up and help out the world by volunteering for this trial. Volunteers receiving the candidate will get two doses 21 days apart like Pfizer's vaccine. Those who are interested in participating can check their eligibility at Novavax.com slash Prevent-19 in Gatersburg. Mariam Shazad for my MCM."
What Makes Novavax's COVID-19 Vaccine Unique,Montgomery Community Media,2021-06-14,ucfaxXP-_c4,"You know our vaccine, why is it so good? It is a it's a mimic of a virus We make a protein that looks just like it does in an infection. Of course, there's nothing live and to get an immune response That is extremely effective. It has to be in the right structure of thus for example the work at NIST So we make this in a very complex process. It takes a big team to characterize this our vaccine is Something that can be premixed so it's in a it's in a you know basically a bottle So the logistics of having very cold temperatures frozen products etc. Go away We have a very traditional Presentation of our virus of our vaccine So we know that two billion people worldwide have received at least one shot But there are six billion people that need to be inoculated. So there's a big global need Our long-term output Outlook is to contribute to public health with vaccines You may know we have a very good influence of vaccine which we intend to develop we could mix it with the COVID vaccine And so looking forward I think we have a you know pipeline of other opportunities"
Novavax vaccine against COVID-19 available this week in LA County,FOX 11 Los Angeles,2022-08-03,lUki-Lw7xfk,"the vaccine. Welcome back to 726. The Novavax COVID vaccine is the newest shot to fight the coronavirus. It is rolling out in Los Angeles County today, although in Long Beach they started offering it yesterday. The hope is that more people are going to be okay getting this vaccine because it uses older protein based technology rather than the mRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that quite frankly scared off some people. We're hesitant to be vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine, the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine. Having an FDA approved vaccine that was developed with a more traditional technology may be exactly what some residents are waiting for. Well, Novavax is a two shot vaccine just like the others delivered three to eight weeks apart."
"COVID vaccines: Novavax exec talks FDA approval process, supply chains, and pandemic outlook",Yahoo Finance,2022-06-01,Ma58WPISG_o,"COVID cases on Memorial Davis here outpaced COVID cases from this time last year underscoring the continued importance of vaccinations. Novavax seeking to get US authorization for its two dose vaccine soon for more on this. Let's bring in Novavax chief commercial officer John Truzino in an exclusive Yahoo Finance interview as well as our very own Yahoo Finance is Angelique and Lonnie who's going to join us for this conversation. John's great to have you on the program. June 7th, 2020. As I understand it is the meeting. It's the first of four that need to happen for your vaccine to get approved here in the United States. And then at some point, you're going to go on to the CDC. Give us the update on where you stand in that and what's your expectation at the end of all this? Yeah, thanks and thanks for having me. The lead in was exactly why this is such an important event for us, you know, coming up on the the verpax. So FDA's advisory committee, which will assess all of the data that we've submitted to date. We'll make their assessment and make a recommendation for the vaccine. We'll make their assessment and make a recommendation for emergency use authorization to be granted to the FDA. And so it's a combination of a lot of work and effort that's gone into all of what we've provided with from clinical data that we have a safe and effective vaccine. And that COVID is here to stay. And we now offer an option of the first protein-based vaccine to be authorized for use in the U.S. and I think we're tremendously excited and optimistic about the outcome of that meeting on Tuesday. John, I'm Julie here. Good to have you on. I know that there is a lot of focus about the manufacturing and the doses coming from the Serum Institute of India and being sent over here. Obviously, we live in a world where we know that there are supply chain pressures right now. How do you plan to ensure that these doses make it over quickly and smoothly and you don't run into any logistics issues? I think we have a lot of focus on the vaccine. So, what are the outcomes? Yeah, so we've been shipping products since the beginning of the year and and Serum Institute has been a tremendously valuable partner. They've built out capacity for us over the last couple of years. They are an absolutely world class facility. They've now been inspected by the FDA and that was a gating event to the Verpack meeting. So 100 percent confident in their ability to manufacture and deliver. We've been shipping into Europe and Australia and Canada and many other countries around the globe. So 100 percent confident in our ability to bring doses into the US and doses will be in the US in a few short weeks after the emergency use authorization is granted. Walk us through that timeline and whether or not you actually see any doses being produced in the US because I know you had to stop production with the US contract manufacturer. Has that relationship completely ended and are you using any others in the US? Well, most importantly for the moment is the same decision to be made. The reason I'm here for the moment is the submission to and review by Verpack and submission to FDA is based upon the serum Institute manufacturing of product. You may recall we made a decision in August of September of last year to focus our CFC activities or manufacturing activities to serum Institute so we can get the regulatory filing submitted as quickly as possible on that proof to be the right decision. We will be adding and supplementing those regulatory filings for the next slide. We will have the results of the trials that we have with the testing facilities at SK Bio. Scientists and then our own manufacturing site in the Czech Republic in Europe. And that will be at least for this year the sites that we'll be using for manufacturing. What about the product that we'll be available in the U.S. will come from serum at least initially. What about the stock itself for the company. You have seen it really on a rollercoaster ride since of the pandemic different vaccine companies experience different interests in investors sentiment. Right now, really the companies under pressure for waiting to see that US approval, do you anticipate that that will sort of boost investor confidence? Yeah, so the market's fairly unpredictable at the moment as we all know, right? I think there's a high degree of volatility. We feel like we're trending in a similar way to many of the other COVID vaccine manufacturers. It's been a downward trend. But it's not reflective of our value. I think we are now in a position to have a successful 22. You remember that we have four to five billion dollars of revenue guidance for 22. We also believe 22 is an important foundation laying year for us as we see and look toward what will be a transition out of the pandemic into normal kind of commercial vaccine selling. And that's going to be an important turning point for us as well. We believe we're going to have sustainable revenue generation and be an important part of annual revax nation for COVID into the foreseeable future. Yes, John, let's pick up on that point because I know you've been asked a lot about the timing of this product coming to market. We're more than two years into the pandemic in developing countries at least. Many are on their second booster shot. What does the demand outlook look like for you? And where are you likely to see the biggest demand? Yeah, again, I refer back to the lead. And I think it's critically important for everybody to understand that there's still a high significant amount of virus circulating around the globe and around the US for sure. And so it's off a bit of the front page in the headline news. But it still is something that we need to be concerned about. We need to focus on. We're not yet sure whether we're going to continue to be six month boosting or annual boosting. But what we do know is there is going to be a continuing high demand for vaccine across the globe. And we'll wait to see exactly what that is. But certainly clear need for vaccine and clear need for revax nation programs."
Proof of vaccine harm,Dr. John Campbell,2024-06-04,DMYZg8_22y8,"Welcome to this talk. Tuesday 4 June. There are a couple of important articles out in the last day or two. One is from the scientific medical literature, admitting the reality of vaccine injuries and the possible extent of vaccine injuries. Another is from a relatively mainstream media outlet. Let's get straight into this now. This could be the start of the shift towards realistic analysis that we're looking for. There's many forces trying to stop that, but let's get into what we have got here. So this is excess mortality across countries in the Western world. This is the paper and it's from the British Medical Journal public health. Very thorough paper, but readable. It's all there. It's freely available. They've kindly kept it in the public domain so you can check it out for yourself. Now let's get straight down to some of the things that they are saying here. This is from the article that I've just looked at. By definition, these serious adverse events, actually adverse events, lead to either, you know, I don't know if I'm allowed to mention that complication or not. It's rather confusing, but that's the complication there anyway. Our life threatening, required impatient or prolongation of hospitalisation, caused persistent, significant disability or incapacity. And this is really the first time this is starting to be talked about. Concern a congenital abnormality or birth defect. Congenital means present at birth, usually indicating abnormal fetal development, or include a medically important event according to medical judgment. So that is directly from this paper that we've just looked at, published in British Medical Journal public health. And I think you'll agree it's a level of frankness that we haven't seen before. The paper is still somewhat circumspect, but it's a level of frankness we haven't seen before. Now the mainstream media in my country remains fairly pathetic. The Delhi Telegraph is a bit of an exception. It must be said. This is their headline here. Covid vaccines may have helped fuel rise in excess deaths. This is from direct quote. This is the heading. Covid vaccines may have helped fuel rise in excess deaths. Experts call for more research into side effects and possible links to mortality rates. So mainstream media, at least Daily Telegraph here, openly talking about part of the cause of the excess deaths that we've been talking about for several years now on this channel, literally several years, could be eatrogenic caused by these interventions, these medical interventions. Now this is, as we said, British Medical Journal public health. Now first of all we notice that the authors from the Netherlands have noticed this paper from not the United States, not the United Kingdom, not Canada, not Australia, not New Zealand, no it's from the Netherlands. But we notice, first of all, that the authors have declared no competing interests. Would it be that all journals, or scientific medical journals could put at the top no competing interests? Wouldn't that be nice? But it's not a situation we are in unfortunately, but it is a situation that is in this particular paper. They say excess mortality is remained high in the Western world for three consecutive years. Western world, three consecutive years. Despite the implementation of Covid containment measures and Covid vaccinations. So really if these methods were so effective, you'd expect these to bring the mortality way down, but it has, that's not what we see. And they say that this increased mortality raises serious concerns, direct quote from the paper, and of course we agree. Government leaders and policymakers need to thoroughly, thoroughly investigate. Any investigation would be good, but a thorough investigation would be better. I mean anything would better than what we haven't got now. I mean basically what we've got now in Parliament, for example, is widespread denial. Just recently the Prime Minister sort of said the Covid vaccines are safe. Just no acknowledgement at all, but now we're starting to see it, which is why this is so encouraging. And this could be the start of something big. I really hope it is the start of an honest discussion. Insight into excess death rates in the years following, WHO's pandemic is crucial for government leaders and policymakers to evaluate their health crisis policies. So their health crisis policies, of course, included their vaccination programs. All cause mortality report from our world in data, 47 Western countries, and the comparators is historical deaths from 2015 until 2019. And of course they account for seasonality on all the other factors that you and I can think of, they have accounted for. And the views pretty sophisticated statistics. I didn't pretend to understand all of the statistical equations included, but the conclusions that they come to are clear. Total excess deaths, first of Jan 2020 to the 31st of December 2022, 3 million 98,000. Access mortality from 2021, 42 countries, 89 percent had increased mortality and in 2022 91 percent had increased mortality. And of course we know the countries that didn't have as much increased mortality. I've often, the Western countries, but the East and European Western countries where vaccination rates were lower. Not saying it's the cause, but that is an observation that we have all made, in fact fairly obvious. Observation really to be quite honest. Sex death, now here we are. 2020, 2021, 2022. 2020 over a million excess deaths. And what they do is put the P scores. Now the P score is the percentage above what we would expect. So 11.4 percent higher than we'll be expected, as an average for the 47 countries. 2021 when the pandemic was dying down, we had mass vaccination. Oh, look at that. We're up to 13.8 percent higher than we would expect. 1,256,942 excess deaths. Herendus numbers. 2022, 800 and 8, of course by now we're well into the Omicron here. These are not all vast majority of these and not attributable to COVID by any way, shape or form. 800 and 8,392 excess deaths with the excess P score, 8.8 percent more than we would expect. Conclusions in the paper, excess mortality is remained high in the Western world for three consecutive years, three consecutive years. Despite the implementation of containment measures for COVID-19 in the vaccines, this raises serious concerns. Serious concerns. This is a lot of people dying. Government leaders and policymakers need to thoroughly investigate as we've said. Now that's basically what that was about. I'll just give a graphic here that they do include the cumulative excess deaths. We see that the numbers really are quite high for the, as it keeps going up and up and up and up for the 47 countries. Concerned. Now I do have some more really quite interesting information. So if you want to stick around for more information, just give me another five minutes and it will be quite illuminating. Secondary analysis of the placebo controlled phase three randomized clinical trials of the MIA COVID vaccines. And we did interview the author of this Joe Freyman about this. It shows that Pfizer trial are the 36 percent higher risk of serious adverse events in the vaccine group as opposed to the placebo group. So 36 percent higher risk, 30 percent higher risk. If people had told you this, before we got vaccinated, we'd have touched it with a barge poll. Really, why won't we talk this in the original trial? Why didn't it take Joe Freyman to do a secondary analysis in his team to do a secondary analysis? As well as doing his day job as a doctor. Quite incredible. Anyway, that's the figures that it's 6 percent more serious adverse, serious adverse events in the vaccination group compared to the placebo group. The authors of the secondary analysis point out that most of these serious adverse events concern common clinical conditions. Now these are common conditions that people get all the time. So very often, they weren't linked to the vaccine. They just thought part of the rough and tumble of life, their disease occurs unfortunately. So a lot of these are common clinical conditions. For example, a scheme stroke, lack of blood supply causing, the brain causing a stroke, a acute coronary syndrome, that's disruption to the blood supply to the myocardium, the heart muscle and bleeding into the brain. But the fact that these are all common, of course, we see these all the time. A scheme stroke, we see it commonly, acute coronary syndrome are very common, very common. Estee elevation, myocardial infarction, none Estee elevation, myocardial infarction, we see these commonly. And would these be in common? This commonality hinders clinical suspicion. And consequently, it's detection as an adverse vaccine reaction. So hinders clinical suspicion, these are happening all the time. So, you dad or your uncle comes in with whatever it is, scheme, extra acute coronary syndrome, brain hemorrhage, sadly, that happens. Very often not attributed to the vaccine, even though it may be caused by the vaccine, what have we been missing here? Quite a lot is polluted, the answer to that question. And that's why it's so important to look at deaths, why this is so vital, what's such a vital study? These reactions include other adverse reactions, cardiovascular disease, heart and blood vessels, coagulation, excessive blood clotting in the blood vessels, hemorrhages, bleeding, gastrointestinal events, stomach, colon, small intestine, thrombosis, blood clots, numerous studies have reported that COVID-19 vaccines may induce myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, pericarditis, inflammation of the lining around the heart, autoimmune disease, where the immune system starts attacking the body's own tissues. Postmortem examinations have also ascribed myocarditis. Encaffalitis is infection, sorry, apologies, encaffalitis is inflammation in the brain. So, encaffalitis inflammation in the brain, possibly for autoimmune reasons, immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, so blood clots reducing the amount of platelets causing further hemorrhage. Thombocytopenia. Intracranial hemorrhage, that's bleeding within the cranial vault of the skull, intracranial hemorrhage, diffuse thrombosis, little blood clots everywhere to COVID-19 vaccinations. Porminary embolism, blood clot in the pulmonary arteries, acute myocardial infarction, immune thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intracrascular caragulation. In other words, in the blood vessels, blood clotting all over the place disseminated intracrascular caragulation. As I say, certainly the daily telegraph, I haven't heard this reported on the mainstream media outlets in the UK, but we have peer-reviewed scientific paper here, and that is a very major shift to greater objectivity and appreciation of this matter. How many years will it take to come out? It took the infected blood scandal 40 years before we had the apologies in Parliament, and the promise of compensation, perhaps up to £2 million per person. How long will it take for this to come out? Your prognostications are just as good as mine. Now on a lighter note, I'm much lighter note, Bob Jackson has kindly sent me a portrait. Now, I have no idea who it is, but I'll let you see if you can work it out for yourself. I thought that was very kind of Bob, so thanks for that Bob very much. No one has ever painted an oil picture of me before, probably did the last time as well, but let me know what you think. There you go. Thanks, Bob, and let me know what you think. Anyway, you've got to lighten things up after such serious issues. This is going to come out. It's a case of when and how quickly. I've never seen my lifetime. But for now, as always, thank you for watching and do check out the article for yourself completely readable. We're only going by the evidence that is provided in the peer-reviewed literature. It's good that it's time to come. Thank you."
"After 5 shots of the mRNA vaccine, what happens?  Alarming fact about cellular immunity",Dr. Hong's Pharmacy Classroom,2023-09-10,xs77f4WhmIE,"All right. Hi, everyone. Good morning for everyone that tuned in. At this point, I see a lot of familiar names. Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Joe. John and Paul, and everyone that's the usual Mr. Java and as well. Okay. So those are already see some good comments here in terms of effect. Well, things about immuno-imprinting, TSO Exorctions, IGG, forecast switching. Well, I'm going to touch up on one topic actually here that is mentioned with the card shout did it come in. Okay. So well, thank you for coming. So this is the third week in a row that I talk about COVID. I know it's a little bit excessive, but it's mostly because the US is anticipating a new XBB booster in the next one or two weeks. And but for some reason, our fish show has not been communicating a lot lately. So here I am to share a study shout some light on what happens to immune response, particularly cellular response after repeating booster after booster of mRNA vaccine. So here with this study, it's really just focusing on mRNA vaccine, but we do want I do want to talk about some implications after work. So let me bring up the study here. All right. So here we are. So this study is published by a Japanese research team looking at both the long term antibody and cellular response in patients undergoing hemodialysis. And after receiving five doses of the mRNA vaccine, including the last September's bivailin vaccine, Japan, they have the same bivailin vaccine as the US, which is the BA45. Unlike Europe, they have to be one, two, so slightly different versions, but the same technology. So let's look at some of the key findings of this article first. And then we will discuss some implications together. So this research team, they started to prospectively actively looking at both the humoral or the antibody or end cellular immunity in more than 2500 residents and healthcare workers in the Fukushima Prefecture in Japan since September 2021. Now, unlike when I see this, I just immediately give me a thought that unlike the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA that kept withholding cellular immunity, saying it was too difficult to measure this Japanese research team said that they used multiple methodologies to evaluate T cell immune memory specific to this SARS-CoV-2 virus. So apparently it's a lot easier to measure cellular immunity in Japan than in the US and worldwide. Well, anyhow, so some study participants received all five of the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer. Not some of them that received a dose, a one dose of more donor as their third dose according to their, you know, record. So there are some mixing match, but nevertheless, or mRNA vaccine. So here is the timeline of these dialysis patients. They had their first dose, second dose, when the first came out, the first year they came out in the middle of 2021 and then they had their third dose. And then the booster, a fourth booster, which is due to original vaccine in early, well, somewhat in the summer of 2022. And then in the fall of 2022, November, they had their bivailant booster. So that's their regimens that they received. So even though that they monitored 25,000 people including some healthy, some, you know, undergo hemodialysis, this paper is really just focused on 61 individuals, okay, that are on hemodialysis. So the result is from 61 individuals. The average age was 70 years old, 90 percent of them had hyper pressure, half had type 2 diabetes, about one in 10 had high cholesterol, and about a quarter of them had a mixing match of a quarter of the 61 individual. So this population, it's more fragile, not even not only just their older, but also they have multiple these common chronic illnesses. So it is considered the so-called high risk populations in general. So just to bring everybody on the same page. So with the current spike protein-based mRNA vaccine, the biggest official selling point is to prevent severe illnesses, particularly in high risk population, like in this study. And in terms of the immunity, T cells or cellular immunity is responsible for preventing severe illness, namely hospitalizations and, you know, death from COVID. And on the other hand, antibody-based or humoral immunity from mRNA vaccine, we have seen that it consistently wings over time, and that's why they are pretty much less than 50 percent effective in preventing infections after about two months or so, like a couple of weeks after it's great, but it drops, you know, throughout all the countries and throughout all different studies. So that is a given fact there. Now this study, they've gave us some very important findings in terms of the cellular side of the story, so which is a little bit newer compared to the rest of that. Let me see, oh, this way you can look at more, maybe. Okay. Now, so here, so even though almost, let's look at the finding, let's scroll down a little bit, very quick. So there's a lot of data there. I'm not going to go through every single graph, but basically the discussions very much supported their data that they reported finding. So even though everybody, almost everybody had antibody responses or immunity, only about half of them, okay, kept their cellular immunity three months after the fifth dose. So it's not looking very great. Now the team also referenced some older studies and point out that even in healthy populations, only about 64 percent of the individual acquired cellular immunity after third dose. Now, this, okay, might be due to a phenomenon called T cell exhaustions, which was seen and confirmed in animal models. And now that has not exactly confirmed in human, okay, you know, there's always this module of, you know, difficulty measure T cells, activities in human. So this has not been officially confirmed, but does make make the pattern. But in terms of, you know, what this T cell exhaustion is, is that without going into too much detail, in brief, is a state where the T cells are chronically stimulated by a given antigens. So namely, for example, chronic infections or keep repeating, for example, keep giving the same antigens over and over from maybe vaccines or other means. Now, and then the T cell would start producing a much lower amount of immune response. So that's why they're exhausted and become less able to keep virus infected cells. And I think, this observation, okay, without going into too much of the, even the science explanation is that it's quite alarming in my opinion, because we are not assessing T cell immunity from vaccine in the vast majority of the people who received the vaccines. I don't know my T cell status, and I doubt a lot of you, any of you know, if you had any vaccines or infections in regardless of the case. So the official recommendations, you know, it's expected that certainly, you know, after booster, you know, the reason is that, well, it's effectiveness to prevent, okay, severe disease in high risk populations. But according to this statistical finding, the finding from this paper, that might not be true for almost as many as half of the people who received the booster after booster, that could that be part of the reason why we continue to see like more hospitalizations and that's due to, you know, COVID-19, then what we would like to see, right? As I have watched a lot of the, you know, almost all of the live FDA and industry presentation discussions about their COVID vaccine throughout the past couple years, and didn't do it in this June, which I was out of the country. But every time, you know, when the advisory committee, the FDA advisory committee, asked for the cellular immunity, cellular data and the FDA and industry kept pushing back and claiming it was too difficult to measure. So if you look at my older videos from last year, I have consistently pointed out these, you know, things that is very concerning. But with this new study, I wonder, just from a scientist's perspective, like if the data was too difficult to obtain or too bad to show people, now I don't want to speculate too much here, but from my standpoint, if I had a good data, I will show it, right? Like there's no reason to not show it. So, okay, well anyhow, so that's, you know, a little bit strange throughout the time. But coming back to the study, the bigger question is that, you know, with these, you know, people, you know, they could be getting the booster and doesn't matter how much they get, you know, after the third dose, basically, they would just stop producing these cellular immunity. Doesn't matter if it is the fourth dose or the fifth dose. So, yeah, that's the problem here. And while the bigger question is, what could be done to protect these high-risk patients if they just won't acquire immunity? A little bit interesting fact here is that they see about, you know, among the 14 individuals who received so-called the Hattero Genius vaccine, I mean, Mix and Match, they mixed in one dose of the Moderna, or actually set 13 percent successfully acquired cellular immunity. So, it's a much higher ratio, you know, compared to those that all received Pfizer. So, now, I didn't mention last week, in my last week's video, that we do have more options this year in the US, including protein-based novel wax, and I'm not selling it, okay? But this finding, you know, does support some, you know, mix and match vaccine regimens. And so, if I were to hypothesize something that I would think, you know, mixing in protein-based vaccine this year may not give you as high of an antibody response immediately, but may stimulate more on the cellular side. It is not, you know, so hard to imagine, because you are essentially giving a much different orientations, or arrangements of the same antigen, even as the same, but it's different, arranged differently. So, that creates some different recognition patterns for the immune systems to recognize. So, it could be expected for that to happen. Now, I do want to point out studies like this one, even though it is a prospective monitoring, it is still observational, okay? That it doesn't have like a control group, okay? And also, it is very limited to a localized or homogeneous populations, and many more. So, that's some of these limitations here. But from, you know, of course, you know, from an official standpoint, you know, I do see some of the reasons, you know, that officials making recommendations, blanket statements, they say, hey, just recommend a booster for for all high-risk patients. I mean, that the makes sense in a way of speaking is that while logistically, financially, it is almost impossible to measure everyone's T-cell activities, now, so, but at the same time, yes, we cannot always do these measurements, but I think a communication is very important. I think it should be the responsibility to communicate important findings like this one, that challenge some of these existing recommendations, like, well, is it more the better? You know, sometimes that might be having some individual variability, and we're talking about high-risk patients and high-risk population, that is the population that we want you, we need to protect the most, right? Now, so, that, unfortunately, that part of the communications is continue not happening very well. And so, here we are, channels like mine do want to report some of these findings, not to discourage everyone from getting vaccine, but on the other hand, is just to give enough information for you to make decisions. And, but, you know, with a study like I'm more disappointed between, you know, the FDA and the industry is that even the advisory committee asked for these cellular immunodata, they've never seen it from that industry side. Like, I'm sure they said they claim that they, well, they've done that, they've measured it, why not show it? Right? So, you know, and it is consistent throughout two years. Don't tell me, you don't have data in two years, right? So, why? Why does that? That's beyond me. Okay. So, you know, before I wrap up here, I do want to repeat this. Well, I personally support rational vaccine decision. I'm not here to say you go get it, not to get it, I'm here to give you enough information. Now, I personally, I'm very honest, I received three doses of mRNA vaccine for Moderna based on my assessments of the current that time situations and also some of the drop requirements. So, but science in this field is very dynamic and changing. And like some of you point out that there is always new findings, you know, TSOX, namely one, you know, immune printing. And actually, there's another two more recent study that's in that area. And I do want to share in the next couple of weeks or so, one next one or two weeks when I, if I can fit it fit into the schedule, looking at, you know, a lot of us that, you know, even have vaccine also had infections. Okay, well, that should boost immunity, right? So, what's next, right? Well, next, I think that's some of the questions that we have. And unfortunately, we don't get a lot of those from maybe news media. But so, that's COVID, you know, it's also changing. Okay. So, I think that is, you know, something to keep in mind. So, I'm here to give you, hopefully, unbiased, okay, information so that you can make this. So, and it is your choice to choose how to stay healthy, right? So, that is all the content for this week. And, you know, that's very, thank you very much for all of you that tuning so early. And I see a lot of comments out point out a few. I'm going to discuss a few that, and we'll wrap up for this week. I know East Coast people, it's okay, nine, and then for rest calls, you may have to come back a little for replay. Let's see. Yeah. And, you know, that's, yes, you know, it's not protective, you know, sometimes when you just get it, you don't expect the vaccine to offer complete protections. That's that's very well-tuned. So, both of my parents, they are older, okay, they're 60, 70s, and they're relatively healthy. They have some chronic conditions, they're on some meds, you know, lipid drugs, you know, blood pressure drug, just like everybody in the 60s and 70s. They had their vaccine, and they had their COVID-2 last December. Yeah. So, it is something happening to a lot of people. Unfortunately, they turn out okay. The ramp up the fear. Yeah, there seems to have a lot of discussions about, you know, maybe even return of masking. I don't think it's rational to lift like what we've lived in the last two years, and I don't think everybody is doing anything like that in that regard. Everybody is traveling. Everybody is, you know, just living more to the normal before COVID. Okay. All right. I think, and thank you for all of you that, so, do you want to thank your imports? Like, in support getting rid of diabetes and heart diseases. Yes, that is something very important. You know, metabolic diseases does bring down your whole immunity overall, and without immunity, a good immunity, you know, that's where infectious disease take over very easily. Okay. All right. Now, I have not covered a Denmark study. I'll look into it in terms of how one batch may have caused more side effects than others. I will mark this stand. Thank you. Thank you. All right. All right. So, that's pretty much for all the noteworthy discussions here. Well, so that's all, and thank you everyone. So, I have a good Sunday. If you're in the US, if you're in other regions, have a good rest of the day, night, anyhow. But while let's tune back next week, and probably with a recorded session on something, maybe we can switch a little bit next week, right? A little bit on a general health topic to help with the data body. So, one last question. I do. Okay. One last question is about J&J. Now, J&J is no longer available. Okay. J&J, there was taking off the market in about May. In the US, it's about 16 million people had J&J. Not a whole lot compared to everybody else. So, I don't think they're updating anymore. They're done. So, there hasn't been any newer research in that regard. Honestly, the most thorough one on J&J was published last December. And you know, you could expect in terms of the side effects, it's very similar to the AstraZeneca in terms of some of the serious one, especially because of the similar technological platform that the virus based problem. So, that's the black card, namely, that's the one of the major one. So, that's that. All right. Thank you very much. And I'll see you again, hopefully, in next week. Take good care. Bye."
"Novavax vs. mRNA 2023, Similarities vs Differences | What's Dr. Hongs' pick for 2023? (Studies)",Dr. Hong's Pharmacy Classroom,2023-09-03,_uviIhV9LF0,"Hi everyone, welcome back this week. Now in the US, according to the latest official data, COVID hospitalization rates have increased for seven strict weeks. Now for high-risk patients, meaning those with chronic illnesses and immunocompromised, that's something probably is on your radar. Now this year we do have a few more choices for the COVID-19 vaccine, which includes the updated protein-based novel-vax vaccine in addition to the MID vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer that will be available in the next few weeks here in the US, if I were to get one, which one would I prefer. So let's break down some of the latest available signs behind the similarities and differences between novel-vax and MID vaccine collectively. Now first we have a study published in June 2023 by a group of UK researchers. This is a single-blind randomized trial looking at various immune responses when novel-vax is given as a booster to people who had AstraZeneca, viral-vector vaccine or the two different MID vaccines. Now first, let's look at the similarities. Is that anti-spec antibodies from all vaccine combos do wing over time and it doesn't matter which type of vaccine? Now what about the differences? First is that the MID novel-vax combo does seem to wing slower than the MID combo. Now in addition to that, the AstraZeneca homologous combos wing the slowest for the first 12 days. MID novel-vax had a little longer combos, wings slower than MID homologous combos in the first 56 days. Now there are virtually no differences between Pfizer and Moderna MID in this study. So here in the US, the AstraZeneca vaccine was only given to clinical trial participants. So for majority of the population, the initial vaccines would be either Pfizer or Moderna MID vaccines. So this finding suggests Hadoelologous boosting with Novavax potentially provides a slightly longer lasting effect than boosting again with the same MID technology. I think it is a quite crucial point here, especially for some people who are concerned with even a mild infection deeper into the coldest season. So the extended duration of the anti-spike IGG from Hadoelologous boosting with the Novavax could be more beneficial for them to last through the winter season. There are several cautionary notes that the study did point out several things that are quite important for people considering getting any COVID vaccine this season. First of all, is that generally speaking protein-based Novavax vaccine stimulates lower antibody production than MID vaccine at the beginning. Now on the other hand, all the testicles vaccine no matter if it is a viral vector-based AstraZeneca, MID from Pfizer or Moderna or protein-vac. Or have very similar T cell or cellular stimulation profile. So they all have quite similar effects against serious illness for a given age group. They also observed that participants with greater BMI or body mass index had less immune response with the Novavax booster. That's an observation without any explanation. However, previous studies in a systematic review have also observed a similar trend in which people with greater BMI responded less to other COVID vaccine. So that is the immunological response side of the story. What about the side effects, which are equally if not even more important. First, let's look at similarities. A retrospective study published in early 2023 analyzed a WHO Global Drug Monitoring Database to look for myeloparicarditis rates associated with Novavax. And based on the data, they saw 61 cases associated with Novavax. 50 of them were from Australia. None of the 6 to the 1 cases were fatal with an average age of 35.5 years old and 62 of them were male. They concluded that Novavax showed a similar increased risk of myeloparicarditis as the M&E vaccines. So in terms of this serious side factor, there are no differences. This study did discuss several hypothesis for the increased risk of myeloparicarditis. But if different technology yield a very similar rate of side effects, then it certainly raises the questions of the antigen or the spike protein itself. Now, are there any differences in terms of other side effects? So a older study published in the Lancet, this showed us that when Novavax was used as a heterologous booster, it had much less common side effects compared to all other mixed and matched boosters. Notice that Novavax as a booster has a much lower rate of myeloping at the injection site and with little to no reports of moderate and severe pain. And the overall common side effects profile of Novavax is much milder than the M&E vaccines. So in summary, Novavax stimulates fewer antibodies than the M&E vaccines. It appears to have a more durable response over time as a booster, meaning it wins slower than the M&E vaccines. In terms of cellular responses, every COVID vaccine as a booster, these points appear to be behaving very similar. Novavax appears to have a valid myeloparicarditis concerns when compared to Pfizer and Moderna. But it does have a less pain and fever associated with the injection. So coming back, okay, before I answer my title question, which one I'd prefer in 2023. Now I have to declare that I have no financial interest in any of these vaccines and I do not represent health officials' recommendations. My pick is only based on my assessment of available science surrounding the given topic. If I were to get a booster, my choice of variant at this point in time would be Novavax. This is mostly based on its milder side effects profile. I don't think anyone like paying a fever from vaccinations, right? Aiming for the highest antibody responses is no longer the most sensible choice because of rapid waning. So regardless of any COVID-19 vaccines, the realistic expectation is to prevent or reduce hospitalization for high risk patients, at least what the vaccine's currently can do or what they're aiming for, even from the manufacturer or from the official side of the Opinium. So with that perspective, so far, all the available data showed very similar profile across all available COVID-19 vaccines in the US market. So not in the UK, the AstraZeneca also showed very similar profile as well in terms of preventing serious illness. So that is my pick based on whatever is available. That's my informed decision. That would I actually go get one right away in a few weeks, probably not, just because my informed decision is that I'm quite healthy, and I think I have built up immune responses. I do get exposed to two COVID patients, people surrounding me, and I have never fortunately never developed any symptomatic disease as far as I know. So I think during those exposure, probably my great-mure response has been stimulated as well. So at this point, there's no available evidence, give me enough information for me to decide to get it right away. So, but if I were to get one, eventually a little bit down in the seasons or maybe something happened, I would get Novavax. What I suggest my parents to get there are older. If they choose to get one, I think if they can get a Novavax one, it would be better because for example, my mom always got fever when she got all these booster in the previous year. So I would tell her to get Novavax just because of less of a chance to get fever. So that is my assessment, and lastly, thank you for all of you showed support and left comments in last week's video. Now, I do read them very thoroughly, even though I may not have time to reply each one of them. So again, I'm here to provide unbiased medical and health information for you all to make informed decisions and to live a healthier life. That is all for this week. I hope to see you again in the next video. Meanwhile, please take good care of yourself and your family. Bye."
How the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was developed,60 Minutes,2020-12-20,AM3gSgvN2Fw,"More than 15,000 of our family members, friends and neighbors fell to the coronavirus this past week. So we could almost hear a national sigh of relief when the pharmaceutical company Pfizer started delivering the first doses of its vaccine across the country. Pfizer, a frequent advertiser on this broadcast, and its German partner biotech, were the only major vaccine developers to refuse federal money for research and development. Yet they were the first to get emergency use authorization from the FDA. Friday, the biotech company Moderna was granted authorization to. Under Operation Warp Speed, the federal government set a target of 20 million inoculations by the end of the year. But that goal might be ambitious. The vaccine's rollout has been rocky. Still, for the first time since the pandemic hit, there appears to be an end in sight, thanks to a revolutionary advance in biotechnology. The story will continue in a moment. This is a worldwide pandemic, the worst in a century. A vaccine with this technology had never gone to market before. That's a big bet you made that this would work. Yeah, I didn't see it as much, maybe as a bet, because we are scientists. That's what we do for living every day. We discover new things. Everything is new. Katherine Janssen is head of vaccine research and development for Pfizer. Based in New York, it's one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Janssen, who developed an interest in science as a child in Germany, grew up to develop vaccines for pneumonia and the HPV virus. So when she first heard of the novel coronavirus, her thoughts turned immediately to a vaccine. When you were starting off on this mission, New York was on fire with this virus. Yeah, we were living in the hot zone in New York. And we saw first hand what was happening every day and build the most chilling thing for me was when we walked our dog and you see one refrigerator truck after the other appearing in the parking lots in front of the hospitals. The refrigerator truck morgues. morgues. Right. Absolutely fueling the desire to come up with the vaccine no matter what it takes. This was kind of personal. I took this very personally. I wanted to find it. Beat it. Fight it down. I was nothing else mattered. Across the Atlantic in mind, Germany, doctors Uger Shaheen and Oslem Turechi were also focused on fighting the coronavirus. Founders of a cutting edge biotechnology company called biotech. They had been collaborating with Pfizer on a flu vaccine when Shaheen read an article on January 24th about a mysterious disease in Wuhan, China. We knew that we are most likely running into a global pandemic and we knew that we don't have time to waste. We started to think about how to implement a vaccine development program from scratch basically and so we had to pivot the entire company. Did you have any doubts about doing that? I did not have doubts. The only thing that concerned me is that we might be too late. The married couples company, biotech, is doing pioneering work on vaccines made with mRNA. Molecules in our cells that pass genetic instructions from our DNA to particles that make proteins, the building blocks of life. We felt responsibility to start to develop a vaccine because we knew the potency of our technology. Creating mRNA molecules in the lab to fight disease has been considered promising technology for more than 30 years but it has never produced a proven vaccine. With the coronavirus spreading through Europe, Shaheen and Turechi redoubled their efforts. By February, biotech had produced 20 different versions of mRNA that triggered immune responses in mice and monkeys. He knew his small company would need help taking its research beyond the lab so he picked up the phone and called his friend advisor, Catherine Jansen. And she said, UGA, why are you calling me? And I said, Catherine, we started to make a vaccine against COVID-19. I wanted to ask you if you think that Pfizer would join us. And she said, of course, UGA, actually I wanted to call you because we are also interested to develop a vaccine and it will become our most important project. It became more like an obsession for Pfizer's CEO, Albert Borla. What I was thinking was if not us then, we are having a lot of experience with vaccines. We have a lot of manufacturing capabilities with vaccines. I went and I said, we need to do something to see if we can help in developing a medical solution. Since March, he had been pressing Pfizer scientists to develop a vaccine quickly. He said an October deadline. Then of course, I gave them also some tools in their hands. I told them that they should think this is not business as usual. There is no consideration of return on investments. They should consider whether they have an open checkbook. An open checkbook. Yes. Did you have any idea how much you'd be willing to spend? It will cost us around $2 billion. And I knew that if we fail and we have to write it off, it's going to be very painful, but we'll not take Pfizer down. Catherine Janssen convinced her boss, Albert Borla, that mRNA technology had the best chance of meeting his tight deadline. From her work with biotech on a flu vaccine, she was convinced mRNA was on the cusp of a breakthrough. So Pfizer CEO Borla signed off on the partnership and rolled the dice on the experimental technology. There was a big chance that you might not succeed. I believe in the power of science. I believe in the power of the private sector. And I believe in the miracles that science in the private sector can do for mankind. Unlike old school vaccines made with real virus, often grown slowly in eggs, these mRNA molecules are produced rapidly in a lab, programmed with a bit of the virus's genetic code. We've all seen pictures of the coronavirus with its crown of spike proteins. The mRNA vaccine instructs your healthy cells to make replicas of the spikes. They can't make you sick, but they do teach the immune system what the virus looks like. If the real virus shows up, your immune system antibodies will attack. By May, Pfizer was ready to start testing the vaccine at different sites in the U.S. And I raised my hand and said yes. They tapped Dr. Mark Mulligan. Why did you want to be in this study? He's director of NYU Langone Vaccine Center in Manhattan. I've worked on HIV AIDS vaccines, Zika, Ebola, flu pandemic vaccines. So this is really the moment for us to jump in and say, okay, let's do it. Let's try to be part of the solution. Almost 44,000 people around the world volunteered for the phased, double-blind trials, testing the vaccines against a placebo. Most or between the ages of 16 and 85, researchers faced some skepticism when they reached out for African American and Hispanic volunteers. Were these communities well represented in the trials? I feel that they were. If you add the Hispanic population and the African American black population and the indigenous American population, it came in at just under 40 percent. We would like to have done a little better, particularly with African Americans. We were just under 10 percent. But I think overall, it's good. We've had several town halls with community partners in Harlem. It's important for us to be able to say yes. We tested it in your community. Yes, it was equally tolerated, safe and equally protective. Participants on the schedule for today? Normally phased trials run sequentially. To speed up the process, the FDA allowed these trials to run simultaneously. Dr. Mulligan told us he had never seen it done so quickly. What do you say to people who worry that that was too fast, that this is being rushed to market? Given the huge public health emergency that we're in internationally, it was appropriate that all speed be used. I've done vaccine trials for 30 years and I promise no corners have been cut on the usual safety evaluations. Volunteers blood samples were brought to this Pfizer facility in Pearl River, New York, where these robots ran day and night helping to analyze the effectiveness of the vaccine. They'll continue collecting and analyzing samples for two years. These robots have taken care of probably about over 180,000 tests. When the critical third phase results were revealed last month, Catherine Jensen was taking a break in the country with her husband. She got a call from Pfizer CEO Albert Borla. And I said, what's up Albert? He said, well, Catherine, we spoke to the FDA. We can say the vaccine is over 90 percent efficacious. I said, what? That is fantastic. So my husband and I, he was standing right next to him. We are jumping up and down. To have a vaccine that was needed so much and to have it be 95 percent protective and to have it happen so quickly is unparalleled in my experience. Can we all just say goodbye to our masks? I'm afraid not. We aren't sure yet that the vaccines will prevent asymptomatic infection. The vaccine isn't probably going to make a difference for this current surge that we're in. We're still going to be going through this for a while. Absolutely. This won't be like a light switch that's on off, but rather like those dimmer switches that we slowly turn up to bring up the lights, 5 percent, 10, 20, 50 percent of people getting vaccinated over months. But to end the pandemic in 2021, we need to get probably 75 percent of people vaccinated and then we can stop the pandemic. There are still a number of unknowns about this vaccine. How long does it last? Are there long term safety issues? Why a few people have had severe allergic reactions? It still needs to be tested on young children and pregnant women. But the most pressing issue? The bumpy rollout. The development of the vaccine was rapid, but so far the distribution has been anything but. Pfizer cut the projected number of doses for 2020 by more than 50 percent, citing a shortage of raw materials. States are complaining they're not getting clear guidance from the federal government's operation warp speed about what they're getting and when. At the moment, the light at the end of the tunnel is still faint. This past week when the US death toll from the pandemic hit 300,000, the bells at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC rang 300 times, once for every thousand Americans killed by the virus. This vaccine has been called a miracle. How would you describe it? We can call it a miracle, but a miracle always has a sense of it just happened. It didn't just happen, right? It was something that was deliberate. It was with passion, dumb was passion was urgency. It was always having in your site that devastating disease."
Pfizer: Full vaccine results indicate its Covid-19 vaccine is 95% effective,CNBC Television,2020-11-18,W9Xb61Ik7no,"Pfizer releasing more details from its COVID vaccine trials. Meg Tarell has the details on this breaking news. Meg, good morning. Good morning, Becky. Well, last Monday we got the interim look at Pfizer's Phase 3 trial. Today we are getting the final results. They have accrued enough cases now to have a final look at the data. So now it's showing it's 95 percent effective at preventing cases of COVID-19. And now they, at this point, have seen 170 total cases. The split of that is 162 among people who did not receive the vaccine, who were on the placebo, only eight on the vaccine. They also saw 10 severe cases of COVID-19 in the trial. And nine of those cases were among people on placebo, only one on vaccine, suggesting also that it's strongly protective, not just against symptomatic COVID-19, but also severe COVID-19. They also saw efficacy across age groups, 94 percent in adults over 65. The company saying that the vaccine was well tolerated, but no serious safety concerns, and they passed that two-month milestone. So now they plan to submit their application to the FDA within days. In terms of other sort of tolerability issues, they say side effects were headache and fatigue often following the second dose. Those can be rather intense, but they do tend to pass quickly, guys. So this moving incredibly fast, Pfizer and Biontech now planning to file within days to the FDA 95 percent efficacy on this COVID-19 vaccine, guys. Meg, we should point out that Pfizer shares are up by about 3 percent on this news. Obviously, more good news there. This means that the vaccine is just as effective as what we've heard from Moderna, which is saying 94.5 percent effective on those issues. And probably the key point that I took out of that is that for older Americans, those age 65 and up, you're still talking about 94 percent efficacy, which is incredibly important because that's the group that is most affected by this. And there's always been questions about vaccines for older Americans, just because they tend to be less effective in general as you get older. The market right now is still looking like it's up at about the same levels it was before, but this is very important news."
What’s In the Pfizer & Moderna COVID Vaccines?,Seeker,2021-02-10,qoorkF8FGyI,"As the COVID-19 vaccines roll out around the world, there is plenty of discussion about what is in these vaccines. These are the ingredient lists for both the Pfizer, Biontech, and Moderna vaccines. And some of these may be really unfamiliar or familiar in a confusing way, like sugar. So let's go one by one and see why all of these are in there. And don't worry, none of them are microchips. The key active ingredient in both Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines is messenger RNA, what we call M RNA. MRNA is a molecule containing the genetic code that tells yourselves how to make one kind of protein. That's the spike protein on the surface of the virus. Your cells can read those instructions in the mRNA and then make that spike protein, which can't infect you on its own, and your immune system learns how to recognize it. You start to build an army of antibodies, and those are the immune proteins that bind to the real virus and clear it away if you ever do get infected. And then after a while, your cells get rid of that mRNA, that genetic material. But your body remembers how to defend itself. It's kind of like showing a picture of a bad guy around town, so everyone knows who to look out for if they ever show up. Now, we can't just inject straight mRNA into someone's body, because your body is actually really good at chewing up and getting rid of foreign genetic material that's not supposed to be there. That's where the other vaccine ingredients come in. Both Pfizer and Moderna contain a variety of lipids. The word lipid is basically just a scientific name for a fat or fat-like molecule. You can even see the word cholesterol in the lipid list for both vaccines. It's the same as the kind that's in your body naturally. And all of these lipids together form tiny little protective bubbles around the mRNA. One of the lipids sticks to the mRNA, others form the structure of the bubble and help that bubble cross your cell membrane into your cells where the mRNA can be used. And other lipids keep the bubbles from clumping together. In both of these vaccines, this whole complex is called a lipid nanoparticle, or LNP. Think of it like if the mRNA is the letter with all of the information, the LNP is the envelope you put the letter in so it can reach its destination safely. And although LNPs are currently the most advanced way of getting vaccine mRNA into a cell so it can do its job, these nanoparticles may potentially be what's causing some allergic reactions. Actually, just one lipid component of the nanoparticle in particular, a form of polyethylenic glycol, called PEG for short. PEGs are actually super common. They're in everything from laxatives to cosmetics, but some people may have an immune reaction to them. And we still don't totally know why. It may actually be that the not the RNA vaccine itself, but the substances that are encapsulating it, the fats and oils that are used, they may actually be generating a very important immune response. Moving on to the next category of ingredients, we've got salts. These help balance the pH of the whole mixture, making it the same pH as your body. Salt's balanced pH by redistributing charges, so a basic salt like sodium acetate helps balance out any acidity. This group of chemicals in the Pfizer vaccine when all taken together is known as PBS, and I've actually used it myself to keep the cells I'm studying alive and well and pH balanced when I'm in the lab. And in both lists, you'll see this familiar ingredient. Sucros. Yeah, exactly the same kind as you have in your baking cupboard, but extra pure, of course. And honestly, between the sugar and the cholesterol, these vaccines actually sound kind of tasty. But the sucrose isn't in there because it tastes good. It's there to keep everything stable at really cold temperatures. So you wonder, why were those RNA vaccines stored at the temperature of dry ice? RNA has a problem with degradation with the newer formulations, perhaps not, and the way their package may also protect them. Having worked with RNA, you know that if you do make the mistake in this contamination, the RNA very rapidly can be turned into pieces, and you don't want that. Sugar essentially packs in around all the proteins and lipids in the other vaccine ingredients, keeping them from losing their shape, and therefore their properties. Think of the sugar kind of like molecular packing peanuts that protect the other stuff in the vaccine from cracking under the icy cold temperatures required by the mRNA. And the cool thing about how cold these vaccines are, get it? Cool, is that they don't need any preservatives. Because everything is kept at such cold temperatures, nothing funky is going to grow in these vaccine vials. The only thing needed to keep them from going bad is ice. And that's all the ingredients on the list. Pretty simple, right? But when it comes to actually using these shots, the Pfizer vaccine that needs to be mixed with saline right before it's injected, to dilute it to the correct concentration. That's just the way it's formulated. The problem is, after you add the saline, the vaccine ingredients only have six hours before they start to degrade. So you have to use it fast. This is where we see how differences in ingredients can make for differences in application. For example, Moderna's vaccine doesn't have to be kept quite as cold as Pfizer's, because its lipid nanoparticles are a little more resilient. This, and the fact that there's no dilution step, makes Moderna's a little bit simpler on a logistical level. So, in theory, easier to get to more people. I hope learning more about these ingredients has made you feel more comfortable and empowered during your vaccine decision making. mRNA vaccines are new in the sense that we've never used them before. But the technology has been around for years and tons of research has gone into making them work. We just haven't ever needed them, or at least not as urgently, until now. And their very nature makes them hugely exciting, not only for COVID, but for tackling many other diseases in the future too. If you want to learn more about COVID vaccines, then check out this video here and subscribe to seeker for all of your updates as vaccination programs roll out around the world. If you have questions about this technology or want us to do another ingredient breakdown for another kind of vaccine, let us know in the comments down below. As always, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you next time."
Pfizer Begins Shipping COVID-19 Vaccines | Sunday TODAY,TODAY,2020-12-13,LwZG3aLDXTQ,"Let's begin this morning with the breaking news that Pfizer is shipping out the first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as we speak with hopes that this is the beginning of the end. NBC's Gabe Gutierrez is outside Pfizer's largest manufacturing facility in Michigan. Gabe, good morning. Well, good morning, the FedEx and the UPS trucks are behind me and we're getting our first look inside that Pfizer plan where workers are putting the finishing touches on those first shipments, putting dry ice pellets inside those boxes. Now figuratively, these deliveries will be seen as a shot in the arm to the American economy as well as the American psyche. Literally, the first shots in the arm for the first Americans are expected tomorrow. This morning, a medical milestone. The first coronavirus vaccine doses in the US are heading out to this massive Pfizer plant in Michigan. About three weeks from now, we can be delivering vaccines to all providers as directed by the states. The initial shipments are expected to be delivered to more than 600 hospitals in clinics by Wednesday. After the FDA authorized Pfizer's vaccine for emergency use. We worked quickly based on the urgency of this pandemic, not because of any other external pressure. UPS says each box like these that went to Canada will not only be packed with dry ice, but a Bluetooth device tracking its sub freezing temperature. We'll be able to see it and we'll be able to monitor its location. UPS will mostly cover the East Coast that X, primarily the West. This is a monumental event. I believe as a company, it may be our finest hour. On Saturday, the Pfizer vaccine cleared another hurdle. A CDC advisory panel also recommended its use for Americans 16 and older, but it noted that people who have had severe allergic reactions to any vaccine before should not get the Pfizer shot for now, and pregnant women should consult their doctors. Healthcare workers plus residents and staff of long-term care facilities will get the vaccine first. For them, new hope today, even as the U.S. saw its deadliest week since April. More than 15,000 deaths nationwide, nearly 200 hospitals at capacity. In Mississippi, where ICU beds are full, frontline worker Janet Siden and her husband got COVID at the same time, Janet died. Our sister is devastated, but still thankful for the vaccine. I wish it had been a month sooner. However, I'm grateful that it's coming and I'm more grateful and relieved that healthcare workers are receiving it first. Now as we take a look inside the Pfizer plant once again, well, it's important that takes stock of the significance of this moment. Most vaccines take at least five years to develop. Some take decades. This one took less than a year. Now in this first shipment, 2.9 million doses, those who go out first about the same amount will go out in another three weeks. And that is to make sure that the Americans that get the first dose will be enough to give them a second, will you? What a great sight this morning of those boxes heading out and getting into people's arms very soon. Gabe Gutierrez and Portage Michigan, thanks so much."
Single Dose of Pfizer Vaccine Shows Surprising Level of Protection,NBC Bay Area,2021-02-20,S8L2NXXon6E,"Well, maybe we need just one dose. That's the debate among medical experts across the country. New research shows a surprising level of protection after just one shot of the Pfizer vaccine. This could change a lot of things. Here's NBC Bay Area, Sergio Cantana. As President Joe Biden toured the Pfizer vaccine factory in Michigan, the CEO pledged to double the output of vaccines within the next couple weeks. The company is currently delivering five million doses a week. It comes as a study out of Israel makes an interesting conclusion. One dose of the Pfizer vaccine, one dose. There was a reduction in after 28 days of 75 percent in infections, just having it in your nose and 85 percent in disease. Dr. Monica Gandhi from UCSF says this study gives real world data that even a single dose can help prevent people from infecting others. But during a White House briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci says people should still get two shots. Even though you can get a fair degree of, quote, protection after a single dose, it clearly is not durable. We know that. He says two shots gives longer protection and helps the body react better to variants. But this new research could give some peace of mind to people who already got their first shot, but maybe worried that their second could be delayed because of the weather. The White House says three million doses are in limbo because of the storm. They should feel quite protected after one dose. And that is a good thing, especially if you have to wait, don't worry. And in an effort to get the vaccine out to more sites, Pfizer now says their vaccine no longer needs to be stored in super cold freezers. But any change in handling instructions still needs to be approved by the FDA. Said Hylkingtona, NBC, Bay Area News."
UK becomes first country to approve Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine | WNT,ABC News,2020-12-02,nlF13YEDL2U,"been here at the top of the UK, the first country to give emergency approval for the Pfizer vaccine, refrigerated trucks like this one, leaving the factory in Belgium set to deliver the first batch of doses within days. So tonight, how is it working there and what can we learn about what to expect here in the coming weeks? ABC's Maggie Rooley from London tonight. Tonight, just hours after the UK became the first country to give the green light to Pfizer's vaccine, the first vials packed up in ultra cold containers are shipped out of this plant in Belgium. Help us on its way with this vaccine. From Easter onwards, things are going to be better and we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy. 400,000 people could be vaccinated next week with the first of two doses starting with the elderly and care homes and their providers, along with people over 80. Millions of doses will follow and what's being called the largest vaccination program in the country's history. It's very, very good news, but if it is by name means the end of the story, it is not the end of our national struggle against uh against coronavirus. The first challenge may be convincing some people to even take the vaccine. I don't trust it, like I don't know what's inside. I just don't like taking anything until I really know too much about it and I feel like this is being pushed out. Now, David, it is still going to take months to roll out this vaccine. Remember, people are going to need two doses of it. Now hospitals like this one tell us they'll be getting this vaccine soon, but in the meantime, while we wait, scientists warn us that things like social distancing and mass wearing, they remain as important as ever. David. No question about that, Maggie, or thanks to you. Hi, everyone. Tourist stuff in Oplici. Thanks for checking out the ABC News YouTube channel.

Pfizer reports Covid-19 vaccine is 95% effective,CNN,2020-11-18,4f7jydIonqk,"All right, breaking news, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer just announced moments ago that its coronavirus vaccine is 95 percent effective and that they will apply for FDA emergency use approval within days. It comes just as the US recorded the deadliest day of the pandemic in six months. Senior chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now. Sanjay, what Pfizer actually reported is a wide array of data about their vaccine, which really fills in some of the gaps here and gives us a much greater understanding and perhaps a reason for optimism about the product. Tell us. Yeah, I think so, John. You know, first of all, we are hearing this information, this news from Pfizer. We want to hear this ultimately from the FDA as well, but if this holds true, exactly as you point out, this is a news that basically demonstrates the effectiveness of this vaccine. Let me show you. I think most people have basically been able to follow these trials for some time, but basically tens of thousands of people received a placebo, tens of thousands of people received a vaccine and they've basically been comparing them. And what they found was that about 170 people developed COVID, the vast majority of those 162 were in the placebo group, okay, versus eight in the vaccine group. And that's where these 95 percent plus numbers come from in terms of effectiveness. Also, you can maybe be able to read that at the bottom, but people who got severely ill, there were 10 people who got severely ill, nine of them were in the placebo group, one in the vaccinated group. So this is again, we're hearing this from the company, but if this holds up, that really does demonstrate the effectiveness and the numbers, frankly, are even better than what we heard a couple of weeks ago on November 9th about the from the early data. It said it was about 90 percent effective. Now they're saying 95 percent effective. Also, the big news is that there's now enough time has passed two months have passed to look at safety data. And they're saying, again, this is the company saying this, but they're saying that they've not had to adverse safety problems. So they're going to go ahead and submit this for an emergency use authorization, which is something that we've been waiting for for some time. So that emergency use authorization, we'll see what happens, but this could all transpire guys over the next several days. But what does that mean, actually, Sanjay? What does that mean for the rest of us? If they're granted the emergency use authorization? Yeah. So if the emergency use authorization, you know, first of all, they would apply for that. If it's granted, then it would go to this another, there's two committees involved, one committee that helps the FDA actually issue that emergency use authorization. Then there's another committee that says, OK, there is now an authorized vaccine out there. Who gets it? Where does it go? The distribution plan. And that is a committee in conjunction with the CDC that basically determines that and determines what's called the vaccine schedule to sort of determine who gets it, when did they get it and things like that. I'll say that all happens. Then we're talking about basically for the first time in all of this, people outside the clinical trial would start receiving the coronavirus vaccine and that could happen before Christmas. And that's great news. I mean, granted, that'll be frontline workers, maybe most vulnerable groups. It could be months and months before the general public gets it and that brings me to the next point, which is we have to get there. I mean, it's all the more incentive to be safe now and do the things we need to do. And we're seeing Sanjay with the statistics, the daily statistics, just numbers that are horrifying. We know we've been talking about hospitalizations in new cases, but the deaths now are starting to rise at a rate that really I think should shock people. We had 1700, 1700 and 7. In fact, to be exact, new deaths reported overnight, and every single one of the matters, I'm concerned that now as we're seeing the hospitalizations and cases rise that we're only going to see these deaths continue to rise at even higher levels over the next several weeks. I know. I know. I mean, this is like one of those mornings, right? We're giving you such good news potentially about the vaccine, but have to remind you of the stark reality of the next few months. Still, yeah, John, these, these, nothing has changed. You know, I mean, we've been reporting on this for months. We see the number of cases go up a few weeks later. You see the number of hospitalizations go up a few weeks after that, the number of deaths go up. I hate saying it, but saying it too many times now for the last several months, but it's true. And the number of deaths, you know, according to the models per day, they think could, you know, start to approach 3,000 again, similar to the sorts of numbers that we saw at the very beginning of this. When we didn't know it was happening, we were all sort of shell shocked by this new pandemic. We could be right back in that same position. There are places within the country that are the hardest hit. We're talking about the Midwest here, and I'm not the kind of guy to say, I told you so, but, you know, when you talk about mask mandates, physical distancing guidelines, states that didn't impose those things are the ones that are being hardest hit now. I'm talking about South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa, Nebraska. These are some of the hardest hit states now in the country, making up nearly 40 percent of new infections. It is still possible to bring this under control. And I'm talking about even shorter the vaccine, which is you correctly point out will be more available for the general public probably late spring, early summer of next year. But there are things that we can do now. I mean, we know we have plenty of evidence now that the masks work, that the physical distancing guidelines work, that are sort of really not having public, large public gatherings work, that closing down or at least limiting occupancy in indoor settings where people closely cluster together works. I mean, it works, masks, public gatherings, and stopping people getting together in large groups inside without masks on. That's a terrible idea. If we do those things, even short of the vaccine, we can start to bend the curve. You remember that flatten the curve thing we used to say at all the time, March and April, we're right back in that same position. Again, we got to flatten the curve, or we're going to overwhelm hospitals and parts of the country. And then you can't take care of people no matter how good your care is. So, Andrea, someone who has taken her kids to get several COVID tests over the past six months, I know that sometimes they're hard to find, sometimes you wait in a long line, sometimes you're in a waiting room with other people who are sick and exhibiting symptoms. And so we need an at home test. Is that on the horizon? Yes, that is on the horizon. Thank you for maybe letting me finish this on a bit of an upbeat note, because these tests are improving as well. You know, a disease that didn't even exist a year ago, developing tests for it, making sure they can get to the point where they're at home. It's a big deal. And there's another one that is coming on the market. This is an at home molecular test. You've heard a lot about the antigen tests. This is an actual molecular test that is looking for the genetic material. And basically the way this works is again, all at home, you would swab yourself, you would take that swab, you would put it in a vial of fluid. You see the machine there? Once you have that vial of fluid, you put that on the machine and you wait about 30 minutes. And it basically just tells you positive or negative. Do you have presence of the virus or not? This could be done at home. My understanding is we'll confirm this, but it'd be around $50. And this is the type of thing that people could do at home and then make decisions. If it comes back positive, you stay at home. If it's negative, you're able to go out with a mask on all the public health practices. But you're absolutely right, Allison. I mean, we think we talk about this in our house all the time. We would love to have this actionable data on a daily basis, even, or certainly a regular basis to be able to make decisions about, you know, how we're going to conduct our lives that day."
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sues Pfizer over COVID-19 vaccine,KHOU 11,2023-11-30,I_7bCqBIcOM,"Today, the Texas Attorney General's office claims COVID vaccine maker Pfizer misrepresented how effective the vaccine is. Yeah, they found a lawsuit that could result in more than $10 million in fines. In a statement, Pfizer said its vaccine has been accurate and science-based. Calling state attorney general Ken Paxen's lawsuit quote, meritless. Paxen says the lawsuit is based on two months of clinical trial data. Those numbers, he says, indicate the vaccine was 0.85 percent effective. Pfizer still maintains the vaccine was 95 percent effective. This is the second lawsuit filed this month by Paxen against Pfizer. The first claims the company and a supplier manipulated quality control tests to distribute ineffective ADHD medication to kids."
Pfizer Says Its Coronavirus Vaccine Is 90 Percent Effective | TODAY,TODAY,2020-11-09,4cb1exz721s,"In what could be a potential breakthrough in the battle against COVID, a vaccine developed by Pfizer in Beyond Tech has shown a 90 percent efficacy rate in a trial with more than 43,000 participants. The companies also saying no serious safety concerns have been observed and that the results have been analyzed by an independent committee. Pfizer's CEO calling it a great day for science and humanity. The announcement comes amid a fast growing and deadly fall surge, which President Alex Joe Biden has pledged to fight. Biden is expected to appoint leaders of his coronavirus task force as soon as today. I will spare no effort, none, or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Coronavirus cases are climbing in nearly every corner of the country. The seven-day average now more than 100,000 new cases per day. Large crowds gathering nationwide to celebrate the election, adding to concerns about the virus's spread. In hotspot states like Utah, families including Lindsey Wootens have been devastated. Her parents were both hospitalized, spending their 34th wedding anniversary in the ICU. My dad was able to come up to the hospital in time to hold my mom's hand as she passed. Her mother just 56. Her father survived, but may never fully recover. Wooten, who also lost her grandfather to the virus, says many in her parents' community, had been skeptical about COVID. It was really frustrating that people were turning this political. That people were bickering back and forth whether to wear a mask or not wear a mask. It isn't political. This morning, one family's pain as scientists work to provide hope for all. Negative pressure rooms like this one where they treat COVID patients are going to be critical in the days to come and they could quickly fill up. As for that vaccine, Pfizer says over the next couple of days, they'll release safety information, hoping to roll out millions of doses around the world of that vaccine by the end of this year, and certainly tens of millions by the next year."
Doctor in Pfizer trial talks distribution of COVID vaccine,ABC News,2020-11-17,5JAbZynVqek,"Joining me now for more on the promising vaccine news is one of the doctors leading the Pfizer trial. Dr. Oñema Oguagua's the associate professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at Yale. Dr. Oguagua, thanks so much for being here. The number most often discussed was that a vaccine would hopefully be at least 50 percent effective. Now you have both Pfizer and Moderna reporting that their vaccines are more than 90 percent effective. How were you able to reach that high level of efficacy? What does that mean for the process moving forward? Yeah, first of all, thank you for having me, Diane. I think those of us involved in the trials are really super excited by the results that were really quite unexpected. You know, we'd quite expected that the vaccines should at least have more than 50 percent efficacy, which is what the FDA said as far. But it's just so heartwarming that vaccines have been so effective. And it's great because having a very effective vaccine would help us achieve the so-called herd immunity, which would mean that if we have enough people who received a vaccine and are protected against the virus, this would really be the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Obviously, they're insufficient doses, but everyone has been mentioned already. And we're hoping that as we start to face in the vaccine and also to have more doses in the first quarter of 2021, that that might mean really the epidemic ending. Those words just changed the game so much and it's been a while, maybe at all, since we've heard them. But we know we're not there yet. Pfizer's launching a pilot delivery program in four states. One of the big challenges is that the vaccine needs to be stored at negative 94 degrees. So how do you do that while shipping? Yeah, so it's recognized that the cold chain is an issue, especially for the Pfizer and what there are no vaccines, but these have been known way ahead of time. And so preparations are being made both on the government end to official course fees and the distribution networks as well as Pfizer, who's also developing their own independent distribution plan. And of course, that would include capacity to have vaccines for those who have been prepared. We're also learning that the vaccines won't be frosted last in the period, for example, when we're trying to vaccine up to 30 days and a little about a week or less for the Pfizer vaccine, which is exciting. So that leads to opportunities to factor these short requirements in which. Yeah, we have. There's so much hope out there with this news and again, it couldn't come at a moment too soon. We're hitting another surge in this virus. And I know you're also part of a community of ambassadors working to assure Americans that vaccine research was done safely just yesterday. Someone mentioned to me, I remember Thalidomide. So what's your message to people who might be hesitant to get the vaccine even after it's approved? Yeah, so while we've been celebrating a lot about having an effective vaccine and frankly, we've run out of emojis in the scientific community. Celebrities can use for tempering that optimism and excitement is that there's quite a lot of vaccines expressed. And I've also experienced that as a frontline research organization that even healthcare workers in the community tend to express that hesitancy for vaccines. So a lot of work really needs to be done to reassure the community and I hope I'm doing so also, sharing on the whole program to really reassure the public that even though the vaccine trials have proceeded at an unprecedented pace, but they've been done carefully, thoughtfully to write a month of oversight and that the vaccine receives emergency use authorization like the FBA, that it's past you all with the safety checks and the efficacy numbers are real and that should really reassure the public. All right, Dr. Aniyama Oboag, we appreciate your time and we appreciate your work. Thank you, sir. Thanks for having me, Diane. It's our pleasure. Hi, everyone. George Stephanopoulos here.

"U.K. Becomes First Country To Approve Pfizer, BioNTech Covid Vaccine | NBC Nightly News",NBC News,2020-12-02,aCXDkIy1YEg,"The potential turning point millions have been waiting for with approval this morning. People in the UK can start getting the Pfizer vaccine early next week. The first Western country to move from the trial phase to vaccinating the public. We've been waiting and hoping for the day when the search lights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy. Distribution is a challenge. The Pfizer vaccine requires a two-dose course, 21 days between shots, and it has to be stored at ultra cold temperatures. So the rollout will begin in hospitals with cold storage. Prioritizing the over 80s. Next, the elderly in care homes. And after it will go out in batches, descending by age group. The military will assist. Football, stadiums, conference centers, and town halls are expected to become vaccination centers. By January, even local pharmacies here will be able to give the shots. This is the biggest and by far the most complex vaccination program in British history. The Pfizer vaccine was developed with the European company, Biontech. I spoke to its inventor, Uyurshaan. This is an extremely important milestone. And we are happy to believe and grateful that we achieved this milestone. How do you think history will remember what we are embarking on now? It's indeed the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Words we've longed to hear now finally backed by action to make them so. Richard Engel, NBC News, London. And digital exclusives. Thanks for watching."
Why two FDA members voted against the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,CNBC Television,2020-12-11,2EtAzVy89ZU,"That FDA advisory panel voting in total to recommend emergency use authorization for Pfizer's vaccine, taking us one step closer to full approval. Meg Jarell's got the latest developments, and Meg, like Joe said, there's a lot to analyze here. Well, they're sure as Becky, I mean, this was a nine hour long meeting with finally that vote at the end of the day. Ultimately, it did come down to 17 Yes votes, four no votes, one of extension, overall overwhelmingly positive, of course, in favor of this vaccine. We were reaching out to the four panelists who voted no. Normally, these meetings give them time to explain their votes, and that is actually some of the most interesting and important moments of these meetings. But this one had run so long they ended it extremely abruptly after they voted. And some of these panelists actually expressed frustration to us when we reached out to them by email because they didn't get a chance to explain their votes. And this is a historic moment for this first COVID-19 vaccine. I mean, this really is the last step before the FDA needs to make its own decision. And so what we heard from those panelists was really at least for two of them. It was about the question that was asked for them to vote on. Essentially, do the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outweigh its risk for use in individuals age 16 years and older. And it was really that age question, guys. Dr. David Kim, from the Department of Health and Human Services, who was one of those no votes, told us, quote, I would have voted, yes, most enthusiastically. And that's why the language been 18 years of age and older. One of the questions really was, you know, Pfizer had extended the age down in the trial after it started the trial. And so there was debate about whether there were enough data in 16 and 17 year olds to include them in a potential emergency use authorization. And on that age question, guys, we actually did get more news from Pfizer that they planned to start a trial in kids ages 5 to 11 in April of next year. They've already included kids down to age 12 in the current trials. So they're waiting for those data to start that next group. And then for kids under 5, it would be after the age 5 to 11 trials. So guys, age was a big discussion yesterday, but there were other issues as well. Of course, those allergic reactions that we heard about from two health care workers in the UK who got some of the first shots this week. So the discussion around how to manage those, how to at least monitor for those. The FDA has asked Pfizer to look out for that potential risk. And then also how to keep running good studies and collecting good data. There was a big debate over the people who volunteered for this trial, but got the placebo. When should they get the vaccine? The sooner you give them the vaccine, the less time you have to collect that gold standard data. But of course, you guys, a big debate about that. So the FDA is sent to decide really at any point, the New York Times is reporting that it could be tomorrow. And after that, distribution begins within 24 hours, guys. So, Zamek, let me just clarify that. There are the four people who voted no. 17 voted yes, four voted no, one abstained, of the four people who voted no. You heard back from two of them, and both of them said they would have voted yes if it had been for 18 and up. Yes. And we didn't hear back from the other two. Well, one of them wasn't allowed to talk with us. He was a member of the government and they deferred questions to the FDA. But the two who did get back to us were very clear that it was specifically the age issue. And if the question had been 18 and older, they would have voted yes. And the abstention? We did not hear back from the impersonal abstained. She had abstained from calling you back apparently. I'm trying to understand the rest now. It's just a lack of data. They just didn't think we knew enough about 16 and 17-year-olds. Here's what I was thinking. It could mean. I think it does. The risk is fairly low for 16 and 17-year-olds. I don't think the side effect risk is very high with this vaccine. But the first hypocritical, I don't know harm. I mean, if the 16 and 17-year-olds would, if it's more of a risk to take them, but it's not. It's obviously the, so it could only be about the data. I guess that they just didn't feel like it had been, that they had numbers to make a decision on. But it's not that these people wouldn't benefit that much from the vaccine. Because I think they could be carriers and give it to older people. So there's a reason you don't want them to get it either, right? Not just their own health. Right. So, there are a couple different issues there. I mean, we actually, I talked with Pfizer, one of the researchers at Pfizer who developed this vaccine last night and asked, why did you guys include 16 and 17-year-olds in this application? Because that actually is the indication in the UK as well. He pointed out 16 and 17-year-olds biologically are not different from 18-year-olds. And so they thought they had enough data to include them in this application. But you're right, Joe. It almost seemed like kind of a funny debate to be having and to potentially hold up this vote and to make certain people have to vote no, even though they supported this vaccine. Because at least from the priorities that have been set from the CDC committee, 16 and 17-year-olds are likely not to get this vaccine for quite some time. There was one panelist who actually will join us next hour to help us understand her vote better. She did say it was also an issue of consent, 16 and 17-year-olds would be having that decision made for them by somebody else. But really, I think there was concern about not enough data in those kids. Shepherd Smith here. Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."
Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gets full approval by FDA l GMA,ABC News,2021-08-24,QjoMNmLvcbM,"more than 95,000 Americans are now hospitalized with COVID-19. Nearly 205 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine have gone to Americans so far and the hope this morning that this full FDA approval could convince even more to get that shot. Eva Pilgrim joins us from right outside Pfizer's headquarters here in New York with the very latest. Good morning, Eva. Good morning, Cecilia. This is one of the most studied vaccines in history. On top of the more than 40,000 volunteers in the clinical trials, we now have eight months worth of real-world data from the more than 1.2 billion doses that we're given out around the world. And health officials are hoping that will reassure those who are waiting to get that first shot. This morning, major new developments in the fight against COVID-19, the FDA granting full approval for Pfizer's vaccine, the fastest vaccine approval in FDA history. Those who have been waiting for full approval should go get your shot now. Pfizer becoming the first vaccine to move past emergency use authorization. Their shot, made with mRNA, does not contain any part of the coronavirus and does not alter people's DNA in order to get full FDA approval. Pfizer had to undergo a more stringent review, submitting results from its ongoing clinical trials and proving substantial evidence of effectiveness. The FDA not just took their time and did the due diligence that needed to be done, but did it quickly and efficiently. The move paves the way for more corporations, government and schools to issue vaccine mandates. The Pentagon now preparing to require the shot for its 1.3 million active duty troops. New York City announcing shots will now be required for all school employees with weekly testing no longer an option. And workers at United Airlines have five weeks to show the now required proof of vaccination. While the FDA's full approval of the Pfizer vaccine applies to those 16 and older, the agency making it clear that does not mean it should be given off label to younger children. They are not just small adults, so we really would have to have the data and the appropriate dose before I recommending that that children will be vaccinated. But this first full approval could be a game changer for those who have been hesitant to get a shot. A recent poll finding that three in 10 of those unvaccinated would be more likely to get it now. And with every state in the country now experiencing high community transmission, except Vermont and Maine, more Americans are dying of COVID. Now an average of 738 every day. Florida just saw its deadliest week. Healthcare workers hoping people will get the vaccine as they face a crush of COVID patients. One of my biggest frustrations is that we're maybe not vaccinating our kids at a rate that is beneficial to everyone. So what about the other vaccines full approval for Moderna and Johnson and Johnson is expected in the coming months? Hi everyone, George Stephanopoulos here.

Here is how the Pfizer vaccine works,11Alive,2020-12-12,-yFqfPj97XQ,"Welcome back. The FDA has issued emergency use authorization approving the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine. But this type of vaccine has never been approved in the US before. Stephanie Whitfield explains how it works. There are 330 vaccine candidates being worked on all over the world. 11 are in clinical trials in the US. Here's what they're all working toward, making the body produce antibodies which protect against COVID-19. How they do that depends on the specific vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna are the furthest along in clinical trials with their messenger RNA vaccines, which is a brand new method never approved in the US before. The idea is messenger RNA sends a message to the body to create what are called spike proteins. Those proteins are found on the outside of novel coronavirus cells. Once your body forms spike proteins, it triggers an immune response. So if you ever come in contact with the real COVID-19, which also has spike proteins, your body will already have the antibodies to fight it off. The messenger RNA vaccine contains no live virus. So experts say you cannot get COVID-19 from the shot. Early results from Pfizer and Moderna's clinical trials have shown their mRNA vaccines are 95 percent effective in preventing symptoms of COVID-19. What we don't know is how long that immunity lasts. We will keep you updated on all the latest vaccine developments, including daily breakdowns of case numbers here in Georgia at 11Alive.com. Just look in our special coronavirus section."
Pfizer’s 90% Effective Vaccine Developed Without Federal Aid,Inside Edition,2020-11-09,3GEeL9Xmjx0,"Incredibly hopeful news on the vaccine front as Pfizer announced its COVID vaccine has a better than 90 percent efficacy And that news couldn't come at a better time the United States today surpassed 10 million COVID cases Emmer Cogliano has more Massive crowds across America rejoiced in the wake of the networks calling the race for Joe Biden But now there's growing concern that these celebrations could become super spreader event They are not socially distancing. I hate to be a a scold here But we just have the highest day of infections in the United States The news that the Pfizer vaccine is 90 percent effective could not be coming at a more crucial time What's the significance of this vaccine development? Yeah, so you know what we've been expecting is a vaccine that might be 60 or at best 70 percent effective And at that level while it helps a lot in controlling the pandemic It certainly doesn't make the pandemic go away Once you get vaccines that are 90 plus percent effective it really starts making a very big difference At one point the stock market soared 1600 points to an all-time high the big question when will the vaccine be ready for all of us What they've said is they're going to have millions of doses by the end of this year But we're going to need to get hundreds of millions of Americans and billions of people around the world vaccinated So I expect that we're really talking about I suspect April made June before most Americans end up having access to this vaccine Conspiracy theories are swirling about the announcement which came down just two days after Joe Biden emerged victorious The timing of this is pretty amazing Donald Trump Jr. tweeted Nothing nefarious about the timing of this at all right At a September rally in Jacksonville president Trump suggested his opponents were orchestrating a delay in the vaccine to undermine his chances We will have a vaccine So soon you won't even believe it Although they're trying to do a little bit of a political hit let's let's today It's just a little bit you notice that but Pfizer says it has never taken any money from the US government or from anyone To intentionally distance the vaccine timeline from politics Today president elect Biden unveiled his coronavirus task force underscoring the virus will be his administration's top priority He said the vaccine is great news, but warned that dark days lie ahead the projections still indicate we could lose 200,000 more lives in the coming months Before a vaccine can be made widely available as we work toward a safe and effective vaccine We know the single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of COVID We're a mask"
COVID-19 Vaccine Q&A | Pfizer vs Moderna Vaccines,Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center,2020-12-22,FZ_TMz6qhTQ,"So the difference between the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine is actually fairly subtle. Both vaccines are mRNA vaccines. Both of them use the same technology platform to make the vaccine. The differences from the standpoint of the person getting vaccinated are probably minor to none. The effectiveness of the vaccine for both the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine are very similar. The effectiveness in older patients, in women, in minorities, in people with other medical problems, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, for example, or significant obesity. All those appear to be very similar between the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine. The side effects also seem to be very similar between the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine. Mostly pain in your shoulder, you know, things like fatigue, headache, joint pain, muscle pain, they all seem to be very similar. The differences are really on the side of the person giving the vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus 80, which I think is, you know, minus 80 centigrade, which is like a minus 100 Fahrenheit. And so it needs to be shipped on drys and stored in special freezers. The Moderna vaccine can be stored at minus 20, which is about the temperature of your regular freezer, although it needs to be still stored in the special freezers that hold the temperature at minus 20, but it's a lot easier to hold it there. And it's actually good at four degrees, a regular refrigerator for 30 days. The Moderna vaccine has less stringent storage and administration conditions than the Pfizer vaccine. So from the standpoint of a hospital, whether you're a big hospital or a very small hospital in the in a rural community, those differences probably make are important. But if you're somebody getting vaccinated, both vaccines work equally well. If you get dose one through Pfizer, you need to get dose two through Pfizer. And right now they say that if you get dose one through Moderna, you need to get dose two from a journey. It's important to people to remember if you get what, if you get a vaccinated by one vaccine for dose one, you need to get vaccinated the same vaccine by dose two. You know, I'm certain that a lot of people are thinking is one vaccine better than the other. And the data right now says that from a person's standpoint that's getting vaccinated, the answer is that they are both very effective and very safe. There doesn't appear to be anything that is significantly different in terms of both the side effects that you can get, the frequency of the side effects and the effectiveness of the vaccine in all the categories that have been looked at. So I don't think my personal opinion is that those vaccines from terms of safety and efficacy are pretty much equivalent. So our recommendation is to get the vaccine that you can get. Not wait for one versus the other. I don't think that that's important. So get the vaccine that you are able to get and get it as quickly as you can."
Pfizer vaccine could soon cost you money | Here's how much,11Alive,2022-10-24,8nPLewBr-Mg,"Price tag could be added to your COVID-19 vaccine soon. This comes as government contracts continue to wind down. Beginning next year, the Pfizer vaccine could cost $130 per dose. The company believes most people will not have to pay that much out of pocket. Right now, many believe it will stay in the range of your annual flu shot, which is typically around $20 per shot."
How does the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine work?,The Immunisation Advisory Centre,2021-08-26,oQYvBqqAemU,"Getting vaccinated is one of the best ways we can protect ourselves, our phano and our communities from COVID-19 illness. Vaccines work by teaching the body's immune system to recognize something that causes a disease, like a virus. It also creates an immune memory so it can help to protect you if you come across the real thing later on. The MRNA COVID-19 vaccine used here in Altiara is proven to be a highly effective vaccine with a great safety profile. Before I received my COVID-19 vaccine, I wanted to understand more about how it works. I asked my sister, who was a nurse, and this is what I learned. When the MRNA COVID-19 vaccine enters your body, it provides a set of coded instructions to create copies of what are called spike proteins. As soon as the spike protein has been made, the vaccine breaks down and it disappears. When your immune system sees these little spike proteins made from the vaccine, it responds to them. The immune system learns to recognize the spikes and becomes ready to fight off a COVID-19 virus. Some in the future, should your body ever encounter the virus which is covered by these spikes, it knows to destroy it. It's comforting to understand that the vaccine doesn't contain any virus and there is no risk that the vaccine can give you the virus. As part of this immune response, some people may feel a bit unwell and have a sore arm, a headache, or a mild fever for a couple of days after getting the vaccine. These are normal responses that signal the vaccine is doing its job. Everyone needs two doses of the vaccine spaced at least 21 days apart. This is so your body can gain better and longer lasting protection by allowing time for antibodies to be generated and an immune memory to form. The best bit is, in getting the vaccine, you're far less likely to spread COVID-19. So you're doing your part to help protect your whanau and community."
COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine: Will it end the crisis?,Sky News,2020-11-09,0meeC-RF-wM,"A bit of breaking news we can bring you about COVID-19. A major breakthrough has been announced in the development of the vaccine for coronavirus. We've cleared one significant hurdle, but there are several more to go before we know the vaccine can be used. It's exceeded scientists' expectations and its discovery has been hailed as a great day for science and humanity. But will the fires of vaccine put an end to the coronavirus crisis? Almost 1.3 million people have died during the COVID-19 pandemic, but now we could be closer to a solution. This vaccine is one of around 12 worldwide in the final stages of testing, but it is the first to produce any results. It's being developed by the German biotech company, BiomeTech, and the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and has been found to be 90 percent effective in preventing people from getting COVID-19. So how do we get here? Well, phase 3 of Pfizer's clinical trials involved more than 43,000 volunteers from six countries. The volunteers were given two doses of either the vaccine, currently neatly codenamed as BNT 162B2 or a placebo. After their second dose, 90 percent of participants given the vaccine were found to be protected from COVID-19. Pfizer was able to calculate this by comparing the number of COVID cases in the two groups, only 94 people had contracted the virus. If the results are as good in high-risk elderly patients and we don't know that for sure until the company has done more analysis, it would mean the vaccine would prevent 90 percent of hospital admissions and deaths. This is huge for the two companies and the news has seen stop markets surge. The FTSE 100 jumped by 5.5 percent when it was announced, and Pfizer's own shares have led by 14 percent. Now, Pfizer and BiomeTech want to apply for emergency approval so they can use the vaccine by the end of November. The caution is needed. We absolutely cannot rely on this news as a solution and the biggest mistake we could make now would be to slacken our resolve at a critical moment. Not everyone in the scientific world is convinced the trials haven't been going for long enough to tell whether the protection will fade or by how much. The way I feel is this is really good news, but we have to manage expectations. For my taste, it might take the whole of 2021, if not more, to really get levels of vaccine-induced herd immunity, so it's for a long time it's going to go hand in hand with all the measures that we have at the moment. We also don't know whether the vaccine will stop the virus from transmitting. If it doesn't, then we will still be living with the virus for a long time to come. That means social distancing and face masks. Pfizer and BiomeTech also need to prove that they can make the vaccine at scale because we will need billions of doses of it. The companies say they can supply 50 million doses by the end of 2020, and 1.3 billion by the end of the following year. But manufacturing enough doses and then immunising hundreds of millions of people around the world is a monumental challenge. Earlier this year, the UK Government ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine enough for about a third of the population since you need two doses each. The UK Government has managed to secure a deal for 40 million doses. Priority will be given to hospital and care home staff and those most at risk. It's still too early to judge this new vaccine, but the hope is it'll be a game changer."
Children Begin Receiving Pfizer’s Covid Vaccine | NBC Nightly News,NBC News,2021-05-11,RArZyMK0O8U,"the vaccinations for children 12 to 15 years old began today at some sites in Georgia moving before the rest of the nation and prior to the CDC's review the first shots were administered after the FDA expanded Pfizer's emergency use authorization by Thursday vaccination sites across the nation will likely start inoculating the nearly 17 million kids who qualify giving them the same dose in the same two shot regimen as adults. I'm really excited to be able to hang out with my friends now. I could not wait to get my children vaccinated my dad passed away in December from COVID. With the vaccine a hundred percent effective for children in the clinical trial the vaccinations are the best shots say experts for a safe return to school to summer camp and for sleep overs 13 year old Caleb Chung took part in the trial. I'm really feeling hopeful and optimistic though the vaccine is nearly ready for mass use hesitancy remains a problem and today on Capitol Hill senator said so is trust blasting top health officials saying the nation is losing confidence in their guidance your vaccinating everybody else's in the room is vaccinated but you're wearing a mask the American people just lost just lost patients with us with new infections hospitalizations and deaths all down more than 70 percent since January lawmakers cited what they call confusing and conflicting guidance over restrictions. I always considered the CDC to be the goal standard I don't anymore. Miguel on vaccinations when might children under 12 be approved to get the shot. Well, Lester trials are still underway for children as young as six months old but by the end of this year Dr. Fauci believes there will be a vaccine available for nearly all children.

Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine makes dry ice a hot commodity,CBC News,2020-12-10,NJPji8p0LQg,"The pandemic curve is looking more like a steep line going up in the United States right now. The number of people in hospital and the number of people dying from COVID-19 is climbing to new peaks. Yesterday alone, more than 3,100 people died. That's a new single day high. The second time in less than a week that a record number of U.S. deaths were reported. More than 106,000 people are hospitalized. Not to a record number that is trending sharply higher. The New York Times reports that hospitals in both big cities and small towns are being overwhelmed and running out of beds to care for critically ill patients. With that grim data for a backdrop, approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be debated today in the United States. A panel of expert advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will be meeting and then making their recommendation. That session will be stream live. The FDA is expected to follow the panel's advice, but it can make its own decision. Approval could come by the end of the day. The official in charge of the Trump administration's vaccine plan says 2.9 million doses will be shipping shortly after that happens. Now as we've been reporting, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees. So ultra-cold dry ice is now a very hot commodity. And our senior correspondent, Susan Armiston, brings us that story today. We're here at Roberts, oxygen, a compressed gas company in Maryland, which is now part of the pandemic solution because it makes, among other things, dry ice. That process starts out here with liquid carbon dioxide, trucked in, and then connected up to this huge storage tank. And here it goes inside for the next step. That CO2 comes into this plant and inside these steel boxes is compressed into pellets of dry ice. They go into what's called a dry ice bin and this can be used for transportation or storage say at a hospital or a pharmacy. The vaccine would go in here and keep it very cold at that minus 70 degrees Celsius temperature for Pfizer's vaccine. The problem is so much of this is time sensitive because dry ice does evaporate so these bins would have to be replenished or replaced on a regular basis. It's an amazing logistical challenge to get this vaccine to all the millions of people who are going to need it. And this company is now part of that.

Trump accuses Pfizer of delaying vaccine announcement until after election,Guardian News,2020-11-20,ilWcGkZjlOw,"A big farmer ran millions of dollars of negative advertisements against me during the campaign, which I won, by the way, but we'll find that out. Almost 74 million votes. We had big farmer against us. We had the media against us. We had big tech against us. We had a lot of dishonesty against us. Pfizer and others were way ahead on vaccines. You wouldn't have a vaccine if it weren't for me for another four years because FDA would have never been able to do what they did. What I forced them to do and Pfizer and others even decided to not assess the results of their vaccine. In other words, not come out with a vaccine until just after the election. That's because of what I did with favorite nations and these other elements. Instead of their original plan to assess the data in October, so they were going to come out in October, but they decided to delay it because of what I'm doing, which is fine with me because, frankly, this is just a very big thing. A very big thing. What I'm doing here, I don't know if anyone's going to appreciate it. So they waited and waited and waited and they thought they'd come out with it a few days after the election. And it would have probably had an impact. Who knows? Maybe it wouldn't have. I'm sure they would have found the ballot someplace, the Democrats and the group."
U.K. regulators warn of possible Pfizer vaccine allergies,CBC News,2020-12-09,iDbAuNhbDps,"News on the coronavirus vaccine that Canada is expected to approve this week and is getting ready to distribute. British health officials are putting out a warning about the Pfizer vaccine and potential allergic reactions. The warning is not stopping the UK from using the Pfizer vaccine this morning. This is the second day of its mass vaccination program. And as you can see in this new video, people are still getting the shot. Health Canada could approve the Pfizer vaccine for use here within days. The provinces are already detailing their plans to start giving the shot to Canadians as soon as possible. As we reported earlier this week, federal officials, health care workers, the military, they are already going through practice runs to distribute it given the intense challenges it presents in this country. We begin with Cindy Palm in London. Once again, live for us, she's been covering the story and of course, live as the UK began its mass inoculations. But what is the latest detail on this breaking news of the allergic reactions, Cindy? Heather, the UK drug regulator is warning that people who have severe reactions should not get this vaccine. So if you have a significant reaction to not just vaccines, but food as well as medicine, you are advised not to take this vaccine that only started to be ruled out yesterday. The UK was the first country in this world to approve this Pfizer biotech of vaccine. Now according to media reports, the two people who fell ill were medical were good. And according to a report, they had what's called an anaphylactoid reaction, which symptoms could be, for example, um, rashes, breathlessness, sometimes a drop in blood pressure. This is not to be confused with an anaphylactis reaction because that is life threatening. This is not that. We've also heard from the UK drug regulator. This is what the chief executive said. Take a listen. From the extensive clinical trials that this wasn't a feature, but if we need to strengthen our advice, now that we've had this experience in the vulnerable populations, the groups who've been active as a priority, we advise to the field immediately. In other words, she's saying that this is not enough to stop the roll out of a vaccine. This was seen as really being a watershed moment, Heather, when it was rolled out yesterday, a light that men people have seen at the at what's been a very dark tunnel this this year. City, there's another vaccine that Canadians could end up getting and it, too, is under the lens this morning. There is peer reviewed research suggesting the AstraZeneca and Oxford vaccine needs some work to improve its effectiveness, particularly for a particularly vulnerable part of the population. What are we learning about it today? Well, Heather, this vaccine was seen as the front runner in the fight against the COVID-19. It had a lot of potential. However, a peer-reviewed article in the medical journal, the Lancet says there's still a lot of work to do to prove that this vaccine is effective because what we saw during the clinical trials was that there were different rates of effectiveness depending on the dosage given. For example, people who received two full doses, the effectiveness there was 62 percent, whereas if you received half a dose followed by a full dose later, that is when the effectiveness went up to 90 percent. And what's also noted in the Lancet is that less than 4 percent of people who participated in this clinical trial were over the age of 70, and very crucially as well, there was no one over the age of 55 who participated in the trial and received the two mixed dosages, the one in which you got the half dose first followed by full dose, and that was the one that had a 90 percent effectiveness rating. Now, we did hear from the Oxford vaccine group head, and this is what he said about the fact that he believes this isn't really a race to be first. Take a listen. The race is much more against the virus than against other developers. We're all in a race against time because if we don't get on with it and start rolling vaccines out, we'll still continue to be in this crazy position that we're in with economies slumping and the impacts that there are directly on people's health from this virus. I hope so I've been really high for this particular vaccine because it is cheaper than the others and easier to ship, whereas for example, the Pfizer vaccine is tricky to handle because it does require being stored in minus 70 degrees Celsius temperatures. Heather. Cindy, thank you very much. Cindy Palm is in London this morning."
Pfizer expected to release new data on COVID vaccine for kids under 5 l GMA,ABC News,2022-02-11,3roYSzP4RwU,"Dr. Nathilates now in the COVID vaccine for young kids. The FDA set to release data on Pfizer's trials on children younger than five. It could come as early as today, which Johnson has the details. Good morning, Whit. George, good morning. 18 million children in this country under age five are still not eligible for a vaccine. So many parents have been waiting for this information since vaccine started rolling out more than a year ago. That clinical trial data expected any day now on Pfizer's vaccine for kids six months through four years old. It comes days before an FDA advisory committee's public meeting next Tuesday when they will review the data and vote on whether to recommend emergency use authorization. And results of the two dose trials evaluated back in December. The efficacy for children between six months and two years old. These are the younger kids with similar to that of teens and young adults. However, the immune response was lower in two to four year olds. So Pfizer is now only submitting data to the FDA for two doses, but says a third dose will likely be needed. George, and we're seeing more states drop mask mandates. George, that's right today. Delaware and Rhode Island. Their indoor mask requirements will expire Nevada. Dropping masks indoors and in schools yesterday. At least 10 states now are moving ahead of CDC recommendations, which still recommend that most people should be wearing masks. George Johnson, thanks. Hi, everyone. George Stephanopoulos here.

What’s The Difference Between Pfizer And Moderna COVID-19 Vaccines? | TODAY,TODAY,2020-12-16,T_VB7qxijis,"but we're going to start. We're going to start on this Wednesday morning with more encouraging news on the coronavirus vaccine rule out. Doses of Pfizer's vaccine have been distributed throughout the country now with a second vaccine option, seemingly imminent. NBC's Tom Castell has been following it all from the very beginning. Tom, let's start with that Moderna vaccine, possibly days away from emergency authorization. What are the main differences between that Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine? So the primary difference between the two is that Moderna's vaccine does not need to be kept at negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit. It can be kept at the regular temperature you have for your own refrigerator. So that would therefore allow for more doses to be spread across the country and not necessarily into big hospitals with that deep freezer capability. So that's a very big step. Now next week, six million doses of Moderna's vaccine alone will start shipping, assuming we have FDA authorization. What's similar to Pfizer's is it is just as effective they believe. It also requires two shots just like the Pfizer shot, but they also believe the Moderna shot may start to provide protection against infection at 63 percent after a single shot. So there's a lot to be hopeful here with the Moderna vaccine on top of the good news out of Pfizer. You just mentioned the FDA Tom, we're hearing that the Food and Drug Administration is also just approved this new at home COVID test. What more can you tell us about that? Yeah, this is a very big deal. This is an at home no swab to check for any sort of antigen that you may have suggesting you have had COVID. And that's important because they are going to start to put this out. They believe in January in your local pharmacy. It'll cost about $30 or so. So it's not really cheap, but 30 bucks to get an at home swab test in the nose and you'll get the results back in about 20 minutes or so. And the company that makes these is dramatically ramping up production. They want to put out about 100,000 kits a day starting in January. One last note here, we've been checking with UPS and FedEx because of course they are the ones who are driving this emergency shipment process for both the Pfizer vaccine and soon the Moderna vaccine. And they both believe that they will be able to execute despite this big storm that's really coming down here on the Northeast. They believe that they'll be able to get those priority vaccine shipments to hospitals up and down the East Coast. Some great news finally. Tell really quickly that woman who was taking a no swab test that's coming out in January at home test. Was she using her smartphone to gauge whether she was negative or positive? Honestly, I didn't see the video you're running at the time there Craig. That may be part of the program. Listen, this is as you know, this is all but about leveraging the absolute newest and technology. That wouldn't surprise me at all. I've got to plead ignorance on that. I didn't quite see what you're looking at. I'm sorry. That's, I got to be honest with you, Tom Castellan, all the years we've worked together. That's literally the first time you did not know the answer to a question. So, here's it. All this for you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you, Tom. All right. I'm just going to say yes. Yeah. Because none of us know how do you get the phone up your nose? That's impossible. All right. It was just be such a mess. Thank you, Tom."
Which COVID-19 vaccine should I take? Oxford AstraZeneca vs. Pfizer,ZOE,2021-01-23,NmYoGcsuwTs,"A asked is which vaccine should I take if you're lucky enough to have the choice? Most people don't get the choice and I myself had the Pfizer Beyond tech vaccine. Difference between them is fairly minor. The Pfizer one is a newer technology but has, according to the trials, slightly improved efficacy in the data by a few percent. The Oxford AstraZeneca one is more standard technology and therefore we know more about it and has a slightly lower percentage uptake but both of these vaccines have much more positive results than the standard flu vaccine you have. So we're talking a different a few percent in terms of which one works better. So if I was you I would be happy to take either and we're slowly learning if either of them has more or less short-term side effects such as headaches or arm soreness at the moment I can't tell you but with more data with more people logging we should be able to assume. So my advice to you is take whichever one you're offered and they do work differently but they both are very similar in terms of the trials. So we should be grateful we've got them not worrying too much about the detail. Good luck."
